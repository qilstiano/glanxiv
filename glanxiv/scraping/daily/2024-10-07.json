We prove that in a ball centred at the\nsingularity there exists a sequence of smooth CMC hypersurfaces, with the same\nprescribed mean curvature, that converge to the given one. Moreover, these\nhypersurfaces arise as boundaries of minimisers. In ambient dimension $8$ the\ncondition on the cone is redundant.

In this paper we propose to learn representations\nfrom sequence data by factorizing the transformations of the latent variables\ninto sparse components. Input data are first encoded as distributions of latent\nactivations and subsequently transformed using a probability flow model, before\nbeing decoded to predict a future input state. The flow model is decomposed\ninto a number of rotational (divergence-free) vector fields and a number of\npotential flow (curl-free) fields. Our sparsity prior encourages only a small\nnumber of these fields to be active at any instant and infers the speed with\nwhich the probability flows along these fields. Training this model is\ncompletely unsupervised using a standard variational objective and results in a\nnew form of disentangled representations where the input is not only\nrepresented by a combination of independent factors, but also by a combination\nof independent transformation primitives given by the learned flow fields. When\nviewing the transformations as symmetries one may interpret this as learning\napproximately equivariant representations. Empirically we demonstrate that this\nmodel achieves state of the art in terms of both data likelihood and\nunsupervised approximate equivariance errors on datasets composed of sequence\ntransformations.",

However, this augmentation strategy suffers from an\ninherent problem called crucial semantics loss: Due to random, strong\ndisturbance, strong augmentation is prone to losing typical visual components,\nhindering cross-domain feature extraction. To address this thus-far ignored\nlimitation, this paper introduces a novel Weak-to-Strong Contrastive Learning\n(WSCoL) approach. The core idea is to distill semantics lossless knowledge in\nthe weak features (from the weak/teacher branch) to guide the representation\nlearning upon the strong features (from the strong/student branch). To achieve\nthis, we project the original features into a shared space using a mapping\nnetwork, thereby reducing the bias between the weak and strong features.\nMeanwhile, a weak features-guided contrastive learning is performed in a\nweak-to-strong manner alternatively. Specifically, we first conduct an\nadaptation-aware prototype-guided clustering on the weak features to generate\npseudo labels for corresponding strong features matched through proposals.\nSequentially, we identify positive-negative samples based on the pseudo labels\nand perform cross-category contrastive learning on the strong features where an\nuncertainty estimator encourages adaptive background contrast.

We model interaction outcomes as equilibria of a\ngame-theoretic planner, where each equilibrium corresponds to a distinct\ninteraction mode. Our framework formulates interactive planning as Constrained\nPotential Trajectory Games (CPTGs), in which local Generalized Nash Equilibria\n(GNEs) represent plausible interaction outcomes.

We utilize implicit particle\nfiltering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the\ngame's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with\noptimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical\nsimulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\\% compared\nto a baseline.

    "abstract": "Connect Four is a two-player game where each player attempts to be the first\nto create a sequence of four of their pieces, arranged horizontally,\nvertically, or diagonally, by dropping pieces into the columns of a grid of\nwidth seven and height six, in alternating turns. Misere Connect Four is played\nby the same rules, but with the opposite objective: do not connect four. This\npaper announces that Misere Connect Four is solved: perfect play by both sides\nleads to a second-player win. More generally, this paper also announces that\nMisere Connect $k$ played on a $w \\times h$ board is also solved, but the\noutcome depends on the game's parameters $k$, $w$, and $h$, and may be a\nfirst-player win, a second-player win, or a draw. These results are\nconstructive, meaning that we provide explicit strategies, thus enabling\nreaders to impress their friends and foes alike with provably optimal play in\nthe misere form of a table-top game for children.",

In the QRJA model, agents provide judgments on\nthe relative quality of different candidates, and the goal is to aggregate\nthese judgments across all agents. In this work, our main conceptual\ncontribution is to explore the interplay between QRJA in a social choice\ncontext and its application to ranking prediction. We observe that in QRJA,\njudges do not have to be people with subjective opinions; for example, a race\ncan be viewed as a \"judgment\" on the contestants' relative abilities. This\nallows us to aggregate results from multiple races to evaluate the contestants'\ntrue qualities. At a technical level, we introduce new aggregation rules for\nQRJA and study their structural and computational properties.

The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \\sim\n10^6 \\left( \\frac{0.1~\\text{meV}}{\\omega_c} \\right)^2$. By optimizing key\nexperimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron\ndetection to $t_{\\text{ave}} \\sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of\nsuch a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design\nenables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our\nbackground-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the\nBREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields.\nFurthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by\nincorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within\nthe cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion\nparameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial\nportion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range.

One promising\nmechanism of UHECR acceleration is magnetized turbulence. We demonstrate from\nfirst principles, using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, that\nmagnetically dominated turbulence accelerates particles on a short timescale,\nproducing a power-law energy distribution with a rigidity-dependent, sharply\ndefined cutoff well approximated by the form $f_{\\rm cut}\\left({E, E_{\\rm\ncut}}\\right) = {\\text{sech}}\\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\\rm cut}}} )^2 \\right]$.

We explore this hypothesis via a\nspatio-temporal atmosphere model capable of simulating time-series,\ndisk-integrated spectra of ultracool atmospheres. We study three scenarios with\ndifferent spectral and temporal components: A null hypothesis without polar\nvortex, and two scenarios with polar vortices. We find that the scenarios with\npolar vortex can explain the observed infrared color-inclination trend and the\nvariability amplitude-inclination trend. The presence of spectrally distinct,\ntime-evolving polar regions in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanet atmospheres\nraises the possibility that one-dimensional, static atmospheric models may be\ninsufficient for reproducing ultracool atmospheres in detail.",

Our findings reveal that advertisers vary\nsignificantly in their strategies: some follow the platform's recommendations,\nwhile others create their own bids, deviating from the provided information.\nThis highlights the need for customized information disclosure policies in\nonline ad marketplaces. We developed an equilibrium model for Generalized\nSecond Price (GSP) auctions, showing that adhering to bid recommendations with\npositive probability is suboptimal. We categorized advertisers as bid-adhering\nor bid-constructing and developed a structural model for self-bidding to\nidentify private valuations.

One popular approach\nis to sequentially rewrite the input computation graph into an equivalent but\nfaster one by replacing individual subgraphs. This approach gives rise to the\nso-called phase-ordering problem in which the application of one rewrite rule\ncan eliminate the possibility to apply an even better one later on. Recent work\nhas shown that equality saturation, a technique from compiler optimization, can\nmitigate this issue by first building an intermediate representation (IR) that\nefficiently stores multiple optimized versions of the input program before\nextracting the best solution in a second step. In practice, however, memory\nconstraints prevent the IR from capturing all optimized versions and thus\nreintroduce the phase-ordering problem in the construction phase. In this\npaper, we present a tensor graph rewriting approach that uses Monte Carlo tree\nsearch to build superior IRs by identifying the most promising rewrite rules.\nWe also introduce a novel extraction algorithm that can provide fast and\naccurate runtime estimates of tensor programs represented in an IR.

Most numerical relativity codes obtain initial\nconditions for low-eccentricity binary simulations by iterating over a sequence\nof short simulations -- measuring eccentricity mid-evolution and correcting the\ninitial data parameters accordingly. Eccentricity measurement depends on a\nnumerically challenging nonlinear fit to an estimator model, and the resulting\neccentricity estimate is extremely sensitive to small changes in how the fit is\nperformed. We have developed an improved algorithm that produces more\nconsistent measurements of eccentricity relative to the time window chosen for\nfitting.

Recent work has\nprimarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features,\nneighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such\ncharacteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial\nstructures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex\nlocations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure,\nexpressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation\nlearning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features\nand distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility\nReconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose\nvisibility graph is $G$.\n  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon\n$P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is\nthat, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first\nestimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The\nSDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon.\nWe show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility\nrelationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly.\nIn order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset.

Unfortunately, specifying an exact\nreward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this\npaper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of\n\\textit{preference} signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise\npreference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each\ndecision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less\ninformation than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more\ndifficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference\nlearning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown\nenvironments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and\ndirectly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that\nDOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first\nalgorithm to ensure $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T\\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with\npreference feedback.

    "abstract": "We introduce a high-fidelity portrait shadow removal model that can\neffectively enhance the image of a portrait by predicting its appearance under\ndisturbing shadows and highlights. Portrait shadow removal is a highly\nill-posed problem where multiple plausible solutions can be found based on a\nsingle image. While existing works have solved this problem by predicting the\nappearance residuals that can propagate local shadow distribution, such methods\nare often incomplete and lead to unnatural predictions, especially for\nportraits with hard shadows. We overcome the limitations of existing local\npropagation methods by formulating the removal problem as a generation task\nwhere a diffusion model learns to globally rebuild the human appearance from\nscratch as a condition of an input portrait image. For robust and natural\nshadow removal, we propose to train the diffusion model with a compositional\nrepurposing framework: a pre-trained text-guided image generation model is\nfirst fine-tuned to harmonize the lighting and color of the foreground with a\nbackground scene by using a background harmonization dataset; and then the\nmodel is further fine-tuned to generate a shadow-free portrait image via a\nshadow-paired dataset. To overcome the limitation of losing fine details in the\nlatent diffusion model, we propose a guided-upsampling network to restore the\noriginal high-frequency details (wrinkles and dots) from the input image. To\nenable our compositional training framework, we construct a high-fidelity and\nlarge-scale dataset using a lightstage capturing system and synthetic graphics\nsimulation. Our generative framework effectively removes shadows caused by both\nself and external occlusions while maintaining original lighting distribution\nand high-frequency details. Our method also demonstrates robustness to diverse\nsubjects captured in real environments.",

The star frequently produces superflares and Paper I presented the first\nevidence of an associated gigantic prominence eruption observed as a\nblueshifted H$\\alpha$ Balmer line emission. In this paper, we present the\nresults of dynamical modeling of the stellar eruption and examine its\nrelationship to the surface starspots and large-scale magnetic fields observed\nconcurrently with the event. By performing a one-dimensional free-fall\ndynamical model and a one dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along\nthe expanding magnetic loop, we found that the prominence eruption likely\noccurred near the stellar limb (12$^{+5}_{-5}$-16$^{+7}_{-7}$ degrees from the\nlimb) and was ejected at an angle of 15$^{+6}_{-5}$-24$^{+6}_{-6}$ degrees\nrelative to the line of sight, and the magnetic structures can expand into a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME). The observed prominence displayed a terminal\nvelocity of $\\sim$0 km s$^{-1}$ prior to disappearance, complicating the\ninterpretation of its dynamics in Paper I. The models in this paper suggest\nthat prominence's H$\\alpha$ intensity diminishes at around or before its\nexpected maximum height, explaining the puzzling time evolution in\nobservations. The TESS light curve modeling and (Zeeman) Doppler Imaging\nrevealed large mid-latitude spots with polarity inversion lines and one polar\nspot with dominant single polarity, all near the stellar limb during the\neruption. This suggests that mid-latitude spots could be the source of the\npre-existing gigantic prominence we reported in Paper I. These results provide\nvaluable insights into the dynamic processes that likely influenced the\nenvironments of early Earth, Mars, Venus, and young exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "This study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct\nmultiple flow fields in a transient natural convection system solely based on\ninstantaneous temperature data at an arbitrary moment. Transient convection\nproblems present reconstruction challenges due to the temporal variability of\nfields across different flow phases. In general, large reconstruction errors\nare observed during the incipient phase, while the quasi-steady phase exhibits\nrelatively smaller errors, reduced by a factor of 2 to 4. We hypothesize that\nreconstruction errors vary across different flow phases due to the changing\nsolution space of a PINN, inferred from the temporal gradients of the fields.\nFurthermore, we find that reconstruction errors tend to accumulate in regions\nwhere the spatial gradients are smaller than the order of $10^{-6}$, likely due\nto the vanishing gradient phenomenon. In convection phenomena, field variations\noften manifest across multiple scales in space. However, PINN-based\nreconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale\nvariations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem. To\nmitigate the errors associated with vanishing gradients, we introduce a\nmulti-scale approach that determines scaling constants for the PINN inputs and\nreformulates inputs across multiple scales. This approach improves the maximum\nand mean errors by 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Our research provides insights\ninto the behavior of PINNs when applied to transient convection problems with\nlarge solution space and field variations across multiple scales.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we define contact invariants in bordered sutured Floer\nhomology. Given a contact 3-manifold with convex boundary, we apply a result of\nZarev (arxiv:1010.3496) to derive contact invariants in the bordered sutured\nmodules $\\widehat{\\mathit{BSA}}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathit{BSD}}$, as well as in\nbimodules $\\widehat{\\mathit{BSAA}},$ $\\widehat{\\mathit{BSDD}},$\n$\\widehat{\\mathit{BSDA}}$ in the case of two boundary components. In the\nconnected boundary case, our invariants appear to agree with bordered contact\ninvariants defined by Alishahi-F\\\"oldv\\'ari-Hendricks-Licata-Petkova-V\\'ertesi\n(arxiv:2011.08672) whenever the latter are defined, although ours can be\ndefined in broader contexts. We prove that these invariants satisfy a pairing\ntheorem, which is a bordered extension of the Honda-Kazez-Mati\\'c gluing map\n(arxiv:0705.2828) for sutured Floer homology. We also show that there is a\ncorrespondence between certain $\\mathcal{A}_{\\infty}$ operations in bordered\ntype-$A$ modules and bypass attachment maps in sutured Floer homology. As an\napplication, we characterize the Stipsicz-V\\'ertesi map from $\\mathit{SFH}$ to\n$\\widehat{\\mathit{HFK}}$ as an $\\mathcal{A}_{\\infty}$ action on\n$\\widehat{\\mathit{CFA}}$. We also apply the immersed curve interpretation of\nHanselman-Rasmussen-Watson (arxiv:1604.03466) to prove results involving\ncontact surgery.",

Our\nalgorithm incorporates quadratic regularization and guarantees convergence\nusing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Notably, it\nproves convergence not only with quadratic regularization but also in cases\nwithout it, whereas earlier works required strictly convex objective functions.\n  In this approach, nodes are treated as agents that collaborate through local\ninteractions to optimize the total transportation cost, relying only on\ninformation from their neighbors.

I argue that this question can only be answered\nby providing a schematization of the observer which is appropriate for the\ncontext of a diffeomorphism-invariant theory. I suggest that this may require\nus to move away from a `passive awareness' conception of consciousness towards\na more agential conception, because there is a clear sense in which an embodied\nagent must experience herself as localised at a time. Finally, I consider what\nthis means for the prospects of using quantum reference frames to address the\nproblem of time, arguing that the way in which quantum reference frames are\nstandardly described does not give us adequate resources to model agency, so\nsome other kind of internal reference frame may be required to fully explain\nhow we observe relational observables in the quantum context.",

    "abstract": "QR codes have become ubiquitous in daily life, enabling rapid information\nexchange. With the increasing adoption of smart wearable devices, there is a\nneed for efficient, and friction-less QR code reading capabilities from\nEgocentric point-of-views. However, adapting existing phone-based QR code\nreaders to egocentric images poses significant challenges. Code reading from\negocentric images bring unique challenges such as wide field-of-view, code\ndistortion and lack of visual feedback as compared to phones where users can\nadjust the position and framing. Furthermore, wearable devices impose\nconstraints on resources like compute, power and memory. To address these\nchallenges, we present EgoQR, a novel system for reading QR codes from\negocentric images, and is well suited for deployment on wearable devices. Our\napproach consists of two primary components: detection and decoding, designed\nto operate on high-resolution images on the device with minimal power\nconsumption and added latency. The detection component efficiently locates\npotential QR codes within the image, while our enhanced decoding component\nextracts and interprets the encoded information. We incorporate innovative\ntechniques to handle the specific challenges of egocentric imagery, such as\nvarying perspectives, wider field of view, and motion blur. We evaluate our\napproach on a dataset of egocentric images, demonstrating 34% improvement in\nreading the code compared to an existing state of the art QR code readers.",

    "abstract": "What is the best compromise in a situation where different people value\ndifferent things? The most commonly accepted method for answering this question\n-- in fields across the behavioral and social sciences, decision theory,\nphilosophy, and artificial intelligence development -- is simply to add up\nutilities associated with the different options and pick the solution with the\nlargest sum. This ``utilitarian'' approach seems like the obvious,\ntheory-neutral way of approaching the problem. But there is an important,\nthough often-ignored, alternative: a ``contractualist'' approach, which\nadvocates for an agreement-driven method of deciding. Remarkably, no research\nhas presented empirical evidence directly comparing the intuitive plausibility\nof these two approaches. In this paper, we systematically explore the proposals\nsuggested by each algorithm (the ``Utilitarian Sum'' and the contractualist\n''Nash Product''), using a paradigm that applies those algorithms to\naggregating preferences across groups in a social decision-making context.\nWhile the dominant approach to value aggregation up to now has been\nutilitarian, we find that people strongly prefer the aggregations recommended\nby the contractualist algorithm. Finally, we compare the judgments of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to that of our (human) participants, finding important\nmisalignment between model and human preferences.",

Rationales,\nin addition to increasing transparency, help models learn to calibrate its\njudgments. Enhancing a model's rationale can therefore improve its calibration\nabilities and ultimately the ability to score content. We introduce\nSelf-Rationalization, an iterative process of improving the rationales for the\njudge models, which consequently improves the score for fine-grained\ncustomizable scoring criteria (i.e., likert-scale scoring with arbitrary\nevaluation criteria). Self-rationalization works by having the model generate\nmultiple judgments with rationales for the same input, curating a preference\npair dataset from its own judgements, and iteratively fine-tuning the judge via\nDPO. Intuitively, this approach allows the judge model to self-improve by\nlearning from its own rationales, leading to better alignment and evaluation\naccuracy. After just two iterations -- while only relying on examples in the\ntraining set -- human evaluation shows that our judge model learns to produce\nhigher quality rationales, with a win rate of $62\\%$ on average compared to\nmodels just trained via SFT on rationale .

    "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)\ncapability. However, it is still unclear how the underlying transformers\naccomplish it, especially in more complex scenarios. Toward this goal, several\nrecent works studied how transformers learn fixed-order Markov chains (FOMC) in\ncontext, yet natural languages are more suitably modeled by variable-order\nMarkov chains (VOMC), i.e., context trees (CTs). In this work, we study the ICL\nof VOMC by viewing language modeling as a form of data compression and focus on\nsmall alphabets and low-order VOMCs. This perspective allows us to leverage\nmature compression algorithms, such as context-tree weighting (CTW) and\nprediction by partial matching (PPM) algorithms as baselines, the former of\nwhich is Bayesian optimal for a class of CTW priors. We empirically observe a\nfew phenomena: 1) Transformers can indeed learn to compress VOMC in-context,\nwhile PPM suffers significantly; 2) The performance of transformers is not very\nsensitive to the number of layers, and even a two-layer transformer can learn\nin-context quite well; and 3) Transformers trained and tested on non-CTW priors\ncan significantly outperform the CTW algorithm. To explain these phenomena, we\nanalyze the attention map of the transformers and extract two mechanisms, on\nwhich we provide two transformer constructions: 1) A construction with $D+2$\nlayers that can mimic the CTW algorithm accurately for CTs of maximum order\n$D$, 2) A 2-layer transformer that utilizes the feed-forward network for\nprobability blending. One distinction from the FOMC setting is that a counting\nmechanism appears to play an important role. We implement these synthetic\ntransformer layers and show that such hybrid transformers can match the ICL\nperformance of transformers, and more interestingly, some of them can perform\neven better despite the much-reduced parameter sets.",

Transfer learning\nwas further utilized to personalize and optimize predictions for specific\npatients. Clinical data was retrospectively obtained for nine epilepsy patients\nvia wearable devices over a period of about three to five days from a\nprospectively maintained database. The physiological data included 54 seizure\noccurrences and included heart rate, blood volume pulse, accelerometry, body\ntemperature, and electrodermal activity.\n  Results and Conclusion: A general deep-learning model trained on the\nphysiological data with randomly sampled test data achieved an accuracy of\n91.94%.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated surprisingly\nrobust performance across a wide range of language-related tasks, including\nprogramming language understanding and generation. In this paper, we take the\nfirst steps towards a formal investigation of using transformers as compilers\nfrom an expressive power perspective. To this end, we introduce a\nrepresentative programming language, Mini-Husky, which encapsulates key\nfeatures of modern C-like languages. We show that if the input code sequence\nhas a bounded depth in both the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and type inference\n(reasonable assumptions based on the clean code principle), then the number of\nparameters required by transformers depends only on the logarithm of the input\nsequence length to handle compilation tasks, such as AST construction, symbol\nresolution, and type analysis. A significant technical challenge stems from the\nfact that transformers operate at a low level, where each layer processes the\ninput sequence as raw vectors without explicitly associating them with\npredefined structure or meaning. In contrast, high-level compiler tasks\nnecessitate managing intricate relationships and structured program\ninformation. Our primary technical contribution is the development of a\ndomain-specific language, Cybertron, which generates formal proofs of the\ntransformer's expressive power, scaling to address compiler tasks. We further\nestablish that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) require at least a linear\nnumber of parameters relative to the input sequence, leading to an exponential\nseparation between transformers and RNNs. Finally, we empirically validate our\ntheoretical results by comparing transformers and RNNs on compiler tasks within\nMini-Husky.",

While recent observations have detected non-Keplerian gas motions in\ndisks, their origins are still being debated. To explore this, we conduct 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations using the code FARGO3D to study non-axisymmetric\nkinematic perturbations at 2 scale heights induced by Jovian planets in\nprotoplanetary disks, followed by examinations of detectable signals in\nsynthetic CO emission line observations at millimeter wavelengths. We advocate\nfor using residual velocity or channel maps, generated by subtracting an\nazimuthally averaged background of the disk, to identify planet-induced\nkinematic perturbations. We investigate the effects of two basic simulation\nparameters, simulation duration and numerical resolution, on the simulation\nresults. Our findings suggest that a short simulation (e.g., 100 orbits) is\ninsufficient to establish a steady velocity pattern given our chosen viscosity\n($\\alpha=10^{-3}$), and displays plenty of fluctuations on orbital timescale.\nSuch transient features could be detected in observations. By contrast, a long\nsimulation (e.g., 1,000 orbits) is required to reach steady state in kinematic\nstructures. At 1,000 orbits, the strongest and detectable velocity structures\nare found in the spiral wakes close to the planet. Through numerical\nconvergence tests, we find hydrodynamics results converge in spiral regions at\na resolution of 14 cells per disk scale height (CPH) or higher.

This embedding is a key in the MOND effects found in galactic\nscales. To adequately describe the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation, the\ncentrifugal force would present a small time-like contribution at large-scale\ndynamics due to the curvature of the Universe. Therefore, the Lagrangian\ndensity is very similar to GR but with subtracting the background curvature (or\nvacuum energy density) of the perturbed hyperconical metric.

While it\nis typically intractable to build a CAD for systems with more than a few\nvariables, we show that a special class of polynomial systems, which includes\nthe polynomials arising from Markov reward processes, can be analyzed much more\ntractably. We establish several theoretical results about such systems and\ndevelop a specialized algorithm to construct their CAD, which allows us to\nperform exact, multi-way sensitivity analysis for common health economic\nanalyses.

A critical attribute of\nwatermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this\npaper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively\nnullifying state-of-the-art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight\ninvolves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian\nnoise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and\nspatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and\nthe spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising\nprocess towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the\ncleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off\nbetween watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose\nan adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying\nnumbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image,\nfollowed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent\nrepresentation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent\nrepresentation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the\ndesired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various\nwatermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer\nsuperior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance\ncompared to existing regeneration approaches.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are overwhelmingly more and more integrated\ninto various applications, ensuring they generate safe and aligned responses is\na pressing need. Previous research on alignment has largely focused on general\ninstruction-following but has often overlooked the unique properties and\nchallenges of safety alignment, such as the brittleness of safety mechanisms.\nTo bridge the gap, we propose the Superficial Safety Alignment Hypothesis\n(SSAH), which posits that safety alignment should teach an otherwise unsafe\nmodel to choose the correct reasoning direction - interpreted as a specialized\nbinary classification task - and incorporate a refusal mechanism with multiple\nreserved fallback options. Furthermore, through SSAH, we hypothesize that\nsafety guardrails in LLMs can be established by just a small number of\nessential components. To verify this, we conduct an ablation study and\nsuccessfully identify four types of attribute-critical components in\nsafety-aligned LLMs: Exclusive Safety Unit (ESU), Exclusive Utility Unit (EUU),\nComplex Unit (CU), and Redundant Unit (RU). Our findings show that freezing\ncertain safety-critical components 7.5\\% during fine-tuning allows the model to\nretain its safety attributes while adapting to new tasks. Additionally, we show\nthat leveraging redundant units 20\\% in the pre-trained model as an ``alignment\nbudget'' can effectively minimize the alignment tax while achieving the\nalignment goal. All considered, this paper concludes that the atomic functional\nunit for safety in LLMs is at the neuron level and underscores that safety\nalignment should not be complicated. We believe this work contributes to the\nfoundation of efficient and scalable safety alignment for future LLMs.",

It has been shown that PCs with a general directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) structure can be understood as a mixture of exponentially\n(in its height) many components, each of which is a product distribution over\nunivariate marginals. However, existing structure learning algorithms for PCs\noften generate tree-structured circuits or use tree-structured circuits as\nintermediate steps to compress them into DAG-structured circuits. This leads to\nthe intriguing question of whether there exists an exponential gap between DAGs\nand trees for the PC structure. In this paper, we provide a negative answer to\nthis conjecture by proving that, for $n$ variables, there exists a\nquasi-polynomial upper bound $n^{O(\\log n)}$ on the size of an equivalent tree\ncomputing the same probability distribution. On the other hand, we also show\nthat given a depth restriction on the tree, there is a super-polynomial\nseparation between tree and DAG-structured PCs.

Using sparse parity as\na sandbox, we identify an implicit curriculum as one mechanism through which\nprogressive distillation accelerates the student's learning.

Through probing the teacher model,\nwe identify an analogous implicit curriculum where the model progressively\nlearns features that capture longer context.

    "abstract": "The non-linear regime of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) has\nbeen studied in the context of several laboratory and astrophysical systems.\nYet, several fundamental aspects remain unclear. One of them is the\nself-similar evolution of the instability. Studies have assumed that non-linear\nMRTI has a self-similar, quadratic growth similar to hydrodynamic (HD) RTI.\nHowever, neither self-similarity nor quadratic growth has been proved\nanalytically. Furthermore, an explicit understanding of the factors that\ncontrol the growth of non-linear instability remains unclear. Magnetic fields\nare known to play a crucial role in the evolution of the instability. Yet, a\nsystematic study discussing how the magnetic field influences the instability\ngrowth is missing. These issues were addressed by performing an analytical and\nnumerical study of the MRTI with a uniform magnetic field. Our study reveals\nthat the imposed magnetic field does not conform to the HD self-similar\nevolution. However, the influence of the imposed magnetic field decays with\ntime (t) as 1/t relative to the other non-linear terms, making the MRTI conform\nto the HD self-similarity. Thus, the HD RTI self-similar scaling becomes\nrelevant to MRTI at late times, when nonlinear dynamics dominate. Based on\nenergy conservation, an equation for the mixing layer height (h) is derived,\nwhich demonstrates the quadratic growth of h in time. This gave insight into\nvarious factors that could influence the non-linear growth of the instability.\nBy studying MRTI at different magnetic field strengths, we demonstrate the role\nof magnetic field strength on the nonlinear growth of MRTI. Thus, the current\nstudy analytically and numerically proves the role of magnetic fields on the\nevolution of MRTI.",

The matrix $A$ can be computed in $O(n^2 d)$ time assuming $f$\ncan be applied to a number in constant time, but the quadratic dependence on\n$n$ is prohibitive in applications where it corresponds to long context\nlengths. For a large class of functions $f$, we show how to find all the\n``large attention scores\", i.e., entries of $A$ which are at least a positive\nvalue $\\varepsilon$, in time with linear dependence on $n$ (i.e., $n \\cdot\n\\textrm{poly}(d/\\varepsilon)$) for a positive parameter $\\varepsilon > 0$. Our\nclass of functions include all functions $f$ of the form $f(x) = |x|^p$, as\nexplored recently in transformer models. Using recently developed tools from\nrandomized numerical linear algebra, we prove that for any $K$, there is a\n``universal set\" $U \\subset [n]$ of size independent of $n$, such that for any\n$Q$ and any row $i$, the large attention scores $A_{i,j}$ in row $i$ of $A$ all\nhave $j \\in U$.

We call the attention mechanism that uses only the subset of\nkeys in the universal set as LevAttention since our algorithm to identify the\nuniversal set $U$ is based on leverage scores. We empirically show the benefits\nof our scheme for vision transformers, showing how to train new models that use\nour universal set while training as well, showing that our model is able to\nconsistently select ``important keys'' during training.",

    "abstract": "Testing whether a sample survey is a credible representation of the\npopulation is an important question to ensure the validity of any downstream\nresearch. While this problem, in general, does not have an efficient solution,\none might take a task-based approach and aim to understand whether a certain\ndata analysis tool, like linear regression, would yield similar answers both on\nthe population and the sample survey. In this paper, we design an algorithm to\ntest the credibility of a sample survey in terms of linear regression. In other\nwords, we design an algorithm that can certify if a sample survey is good\nenough to guarantee the correctness of data analysis done using linear\nregression tools. Nowadays, one is naturally concerned about data privacy in\nsurveys. Thus, we further test the credibility of surveys published in a\ndifferentially private manner. Specifically, we focus on Local Differential\nPrivacy (LDP), which is a standard technique to ensure privacy in surveys where\nthe survey participants might not trust the aggregator. We extend our algorithm\nto work even when the data analysis has been done using surveys with LDP. In\nthe process, we also propose an algorithm that learns with high probability the\nguarantees a linear regression model on a survey published with LDP. Our\nalgorithm also serves as a mechanism to learn linear regression models from\ndata corrupted with noise coming from any subexponential distribution. We prove\nthat it achieves the optimal estimation error bound for $\\ell_1$ linear\nregression, which might be of broader interest. We prove the theoretical\ncorrectness of our algorithms while trying to reduce the sample complexity for\nboth public and private surveys. We also numerically demonstrate the\nperformance of our algorithms on real and synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern\nsoftware systems, interfacing between the user and the Internet to assist with\ntasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks,\nthe LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval,\nresults from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to\nmanipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected\ninto external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and\ninstead execute a malicious instruction. To mitigate this vulnerability, we\npropose a new defense called SecAlign based on the technique of preference\noptimization. Our defense first constructs a preference dataset with\nprompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that respond to the legitimate\ninstruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond to the injection). We\nthen perform preference optimization on this dataset to teach the LLM to prefer\nthe secure output over the insecure one. This provides the first known method\nthat reduces the success rates of various prompt injections to <10%, even\nagainst attacks much more sophisticated than ones seen during training. This\nindicates our defense generalizes well against unknown and yet-to-come attacks.\nAlso, SecAlign models are still practical with similar utility to the one\nbefore defensive training in our evaluations.

The\nobjective of this work is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of recent\ndeep-learning models on the task of mangrove segmentation. We first introduce\nand make available a novel open-source dataset, MagSet-2, incorporating\nmangrove annotations from the Global Mangrove Watch and satellite images from\nSentinel-2, from mangrove positions all over the world. We then benchmark three\narchitectural groups, namely convolutional, transformer, and mamba models,\nusing the created dataset. The experimental outcomes further validate the deep\nlearning community's interest in the Mamba model, which surpasses other\narchitectures in all metrics.",

    "abstract": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will implement a devoted weak\ngravitational lensing program with its High Latitude Wide Area Survey. For\ncosmological purposes, a critical step in Roman image processing is to combine\ndithered undersampled images into unified oversampled images and thus enable\nhigh-precision shape measurements. IMCOM is an image coaddition algorithm which\noffers control over point spread functions in output images. This paper\npresents the refactored IMCOM software, featuring full object-oriented\nprogramming, improved data structures, and alternative linear algebra\nstrategies for determining coaddition weights. Combining these improvements and\nother acceleration measures, to produce almost equivalent coadded images, the\nconsumption of core-hours has been reduced by about an order of magnitude. We\nthen re-coadd a $16 \\times 16 \\,{\\rm arcmin}^2$ region of our previous image\nsimulations with three linear algebra kernels in four bands, and compare the\nresults in terms of IMCOM optimization goals, properties of coadded noise\nframes, and measurements of simulated stars. The Cholesky kernel is efficient\nand relatively accurate, yet its irregular windows for input pixels slightly\nbias coaddition results. The iterative kernel avoids this issue by tailoring\ninput pixel selection for each output pixel; it yields better noise control,\nbut can be limited by random errors due to finite tolerance. The empirical\nkernel coadds images using an empirical relation based on geometry; it is\ninaccurate, but being much faster, it provides a valid option for \"quick look\"\npurposes. We fine-tune IMCOM hyperparameters in a companion paper.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, the current paradigm of\ntreating AI as a passive tool no longer suffices. As a human-AI team, we\ntogether advocate for a shift toward viewing AI as a learning partner, akin to\na student who learns from interactions with humans. Drawing from\ninterdisciplinary concepts such as ecorithms, order from chaos, and\ncooperation, we explore how AI can evolve and adapt in unpredictable\nenvironments. Arising from these brief explorations, we present two key\nrecommendations: (1) foster ethical, cooperative treatment of AI to benefit\nboth humans and AI, and (2) leverage the inherent heterogeneity between human\nand AI minds to create a synergistic hybrid intelligence. By reframing AI as a\ndynamic partner, a model emerges in which AI systems develop alongside humans,\nlearning from human interactions and feedback loops including reflections on\nteam conversations. Drawing from a transpersonal and interdependent approach to\nconsciousness, we suggest that a \"third mind\" emerges through collaborative\nhuman-AI relationships. Through design interventions such as interactive\nlearning and conversational debriefing and foundational interventions allowing\nAI to model multiple types of minds, we hope to provide a path toward more\nadaptive, ethical, and emotionally healthy human-AI relationships.

Although the SSN approach presents a\ncompelling potential solution, its adaptation to functional data remains\ncomplex. In this work, we propose a functional SSN method that retains the\nadvantageous properties of classical functional regression approaches while\nalso improving scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this\napproach accurately recovers underlying signals, enhances predictive\nperformance, and performs favorably compared to competing methods.",

    "abstract": "Learning from observation (LfO) aims to imitate experts by learning from\nstate-only demonstrations without requiring action labels. Existing adversarial\nimitation learning approaches learn a generator agent policy to produce state\ntransitions that are indistinguishable to a discriminator that learns to\nclassify agent and expert state transitions. Despite its simplicity in\nformulation, these methods are often sensitive to hyperparameters and brittle\nto train. Motivated by the recent success of diffusion models in generative\nmodeling, we propose to integrate a diffusion model into the adversarial\nimitation learning from observation framework. Specifically, we employ a\ndiffusion model to capture expert and agent transitions by generating the next\nstate, given the current state. Then, we reformulate the learning objective to\ntrain the diffusion model as a binary classifier and use it to provide\n\"realness\" rewards for policy learning. Our proposed framework, Diffusion\nImitation from Observation (DIFO), demonstrates superior performance in various\ncontinuous control domains, including navigation, locomotion, manipulation, and\ngames.

In a recent study (Castro-Cisneros et al. 2023), we found with N-body\nnumerical simulations that the orbit of Kamo'oalewa is dynamically compatible\nwith rare pathways of lunar ejecta captured into Earth's co-orbital region,\npersistently transitioning between horseshoe and quasi-satellite (HS-QS)\nstates. Subsequently, Jiao et al. (2024) found with hydrodynamic and N-body\nsimulations that the geologically young lunar crater Giordano Bruno generated\nup to 300 Kamo'oalewa-sized escaping fragments, and up to three of those could\nhave become Earth co-orbitals. However, these results are based upon specific\ninitial conditions of the major planets in the Solar System, close to the\ncurrent epoch. In particular, over megayear time spans, Earth's eccentricity\nundergoes excursions up to five times its current value, potentially affecting\nthe chaotic orbital evolution of lunar ejecta and their capture into Earth's\nco-orbital regions. In the present work, we carry out additional numerical\nsimulations to compute the statistics of co-orbital outcomes across different\nlaunch epochs, representative of the full range of Earth's eccentricity values.\nOur main results are as follows: Kamo'oalewa-like co-orbital outcomes of lunar\nejecta vary only slightly across the range of Earth's orbital eccentricity,\nsuggesting no privileged ejecta launching epoch for such objects; the\nprobability of co-orbital outcomes decreases rapidly with increasing launch\nspeed, but long-lived HS-QS states are favored at higher launch speeds.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a non-Hermitian (NH) ladder subjected to a variety of\ndriving protocols. The driven system looses chiral symmetry (CS) whose presence\nis indispensable for its topological characterization. Further, the bulk\nboundary correspondence (BBC) gets adversely affected due to the presence of\nnon-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we present a formalism that not only\nretrieves the lost CS, but also restores the BBC via the construction of a\ngeneralized Brillouin zone (GBZ). Specifically, we employ delta and step drives\nto compare and contrast between them with regard to their impact on NHSE.\nFurther, a widely studied harmonic drive is invoked in this context, not only\nfor the sake of completeness, but its distinct computational framework offers\nvaluable insights on the properties of out-of-equilibrium systems. While the\ndelta and the harmonic drives exhibit unidirectional skin effect in the system,\nthe step drive may show bi-directional skin effect. Also, there are specific\npoints in the parameter space that are devoid of skin effect. These act as\ncritical points that distinguish the skin modes to be localized at one boundary\nor the other. Moreover, for the computation of the non-Bloch invariants, we\nemploy GBZ via a pair of symmetric time frames corresponding to the delta and\nthe step drives, while a high-frequency expansion was carried out to deal with\nthe harmonic drive. Finally, we present phase boundary diagrams that demarcate\ndistinct NH phases obtained via tracking the trajectories of the exceptional\npoints. These diagrams demonstrate a co-existence of the zero and $\\pi$ energy\nmodes in the strong NH limit and thus may be relevant for studies of Floquet\ntime crystals.",

In order to use reinforcement learning, a reward\nfunction is needed.

Besides the F1 score, we also include\nthe total number of trainable parameters in our reward function to limit the\nsize of the designed model and ensure it fits within the resource constraints\nimposed by nanosatellite platforms. Finally, we deployed the best neural\nnetwork to the Google Coral Micro Dev Board and evaluated its inference latency\nand power consumption.

The proposed algorithm\nseamlessly integrates with existing solutions, boasting easy implementation,\nwhile comprehensive experiments underscore its superior performance and\nefficiency on large-scale benchmarks. Specifically, our improvements to\nstate-of-the-art historical embedding methods result in a 2.7% and 3.6%\nperformance enhancement on the ogbn-papers100M and ogbn-products dataset\nrespectively, accompanied by notably accelerated convergence.",

    "abstract": "Tensor network contraction is a powerful computational tool in quantum\nmany-body physics, quantum information and quantum chemistry. The complexity of\ncontracting a tensor network is thought to mainly depend on its entanglement\nproperties, as reflected by the Schmidt rank across bipartite cuts. Here, we\nstudy how the complexity of tensor-network contraction depends on a different\nnotion of quantumness, namely, the sign structure of its entries. We tackle\nthis question rigorously by investigating the complexity of contracting tensor\nnetworks whose entries have a positive bias.\n  We show that for intermediate bond dimension d>~n, a small positive mean\nvalue >~1/d of the tensor entries already dramatically decreases the\ncomputational complexity of approximately contracting random tensor networks,\nenabling a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for arbitrary 1/poly(n)\nmultiplicative approximation. At the same time exactly contracting such tensor\nnetworks remains #P-hard, like for the zero-mean case [HHEG20]. The mean value\n1/d matches the phase transition point observed in [CJHS24]. Our proof makes\nuse of Barvinok's method for approximate counting and the technique of mapping\nrandom instances to statistical mechanical models. We further consider the\nworst-case complexity of approximate contraction of positive tensor networks,\nwhere all entries are non-negative. We first give a simple proof showing that a\nmultiplicative approximation with error exponentially close to one is at least\nStoqMA-hard. We then show that when considering additive error in the matrix\n1-norm, the contraction of positive tensor network is BPP-Complete. This result\ncompares to Arad and Landau's [AL10] result, which shows that for general\ntensor networks, approximate contraction up to matrix 2-norm additive error is\nBQP-Complete.",

Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are\nincreasingly helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with\ncreative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek\nartificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help\nwith, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in\nmechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized\nknowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly\nfirst-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and\ntest become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data\npublishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as\nappropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the\npast. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in\nmechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks,\nshowing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in\nfields where data-driven methods have been booming originally.

Though seemingly not an unresolved issue, we point out that the\ncompressed matrix in our case is sampled in a deterministic pattern instead of\nthose random ones on which existing studies depend. In fact, deterministic\nsampling is much more hardware-friendly than random ones. The limited resources\non many platforms leave deterministic sampling the only choice to sense a\nmatrix, resulting in the significance of investigating robust matrix completion\nwith deterministic pattern. In such spirit, this paper proposes\n\\textit{restricted approximate $\\infty$-isometry property} and proves that, if\na \\textit{low-rank} and \\textit{incoherent} square matrix and certain\ndeterministic sampling pattern satisfy such property and two existing\nconditions called \\textit{isomerism} and \\textit{relative\nwell-conditionedness}, the exact recovery from its sampled counterpart grossly\ncorrupted by a small fraction of outliers via convex optimization happens with\nvery high probability.",

Then, we designed a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based tool named DiscomfortFilter, which constructs an\neditable preference profile for a user and helps the user express filtering\nneeds through conversation to mask discomforting preferences within the\nprofile.

One\nof the most effective ways to produce reliable confidence estimates with a\npre-trained model is by applying a post-hoc recalibration method. Popular\nrecalibration methods like temperature scaling are typically fit on a small\namount of data and work in the model's output space, as opposed to the more\nexpressive feature embedding space, and thus usually have only one or a handful\nof parameters. However, the target distribution to which they are applied is\noften complex and difficult to fit well with such a function.

    "abstract": "JWST observations of the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A\nrevealed an unexpected structure seen as a green emission feature in colored\ncomposite MIRI F1130W and F1280W images - hence dubbed the Green Monster - that\nstretches across the central parts of the remnant in projection. Combining the\nkinematic information from NIRSpec and MIRI MRS with the multi-wavelength\nimaging from NIRCam and MIRI, we associate the Green Monster with circumstellar\nmaterial that was lost during an asymmetric mass-loss phase. MIRI images are\ndominated by dust emission but its spectra show emission lines from Ne, H and\nFe with low radial velocities indicative of a CSM nature. An X-ray analysis of\nthis feature in a companion paper (Vink et al. 2024) supports its CSM nature\nand detects significant blue shifting, thereby placing the Green Monster on the\nnear side, in front of the Cas A SN remnant. The most striking features of the\nGreen Monster are dozens of almost perfectly circular 1\" - 3\" sized holes, most\nlikely created by interaction between high-velocity SN ejecta material and the\nCSM. Further investigation is needed to understand whether these holes were\nformed by small 8000-10500 km/s N-rich ejecta knots that penetrated and\nadvanced out ahead of the remnant's 5000 - 6000 km/s outer blastwave, or by\nnarrow ejecta fingers that protrude into the forward-shocked CSM. The detection\nof the Green Monster provides further evidence of the highly asymmetric\nmass-loss that Cas A's progenitor star underwent prior to explosion.",

    "abstract": "Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs\nmicrotargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific\ndemographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting\npractices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs)\nto examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects:\ndemographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to\naccurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age\ngroup, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the\nLLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent\nreasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic\nelements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct\nstrategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults\nare primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental\nconsciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving\nroles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs\nin detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness\nanalysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings\nindicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist,\nparticularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By\nshowcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted\ncommunication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study\nprovides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing\ntransparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate\ncampaigns.",

Leveraging a new Cycle 2 JWST\ntreasury program targeting nearby galaxies, we expand the sample size by more\nthan an order of magnitude compared to previous ~100 pc resolution CO-PAH\ncomparisons. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to\nbe molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 um, 7.7 um,\nand 11.3 um PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W\nfilters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which\nhave indices in the range 0.8-1.3, implying relatively weak variations in the\nobserved CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that\nCO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to\nthose in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of\nregions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all\ntracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and\nenhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show\n0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH, and this\nnormalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (sSFR) and\ncorrelates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these\ngalaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor\nto estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take\nadvantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.",

Observations show the presence of a\nstellar halo around them, which can give precious insights into the evolution\nof UFDs. This work investigates how merger properties impact the formation of\nstellar halos around UFDs, focusing on Tucana II, the most promising UFD\nassembled through mergers. We develop N-body simulations of isolated mergers\nbetween two UFDs with $1M_\\odot$ stellar resolution. We build a suite of\nsimulations by varying: i) the merger mass ratio, $M_1/M_2$, the specific ii)\nkinetic energy, $k$, and iii) angular momentum, $l$, iv) the dark-to-stellar\nmass ratio, $M_{DM}/M_*$, of the progenitors and iv) their stellar size,\n$R_{1/2}$. We use a neural network to explore the parameter space, emulating\nthe properties of the \"post-merger\" UFD by quantifying the half-mass radius\n($R_*$) and the fraction of stars at radii $>5R_*$ ($f_5$). Our principal\ncomponent analysis clearly shows that $f_5$ ($R_*$) is primarily determined by\n$M_1/M_2$ ($R_{1/2}$), with $R_{1/2}$ ($M_1/M_2$) playing a secondary role.\nBoth $f_5$ and $R_*$ show almost no dependence on $k$, $l$, and $M_{DM}/M_*$ in\nthe explored range. Using our emulator, we find that to form the stellar halo\nobserved in Tucana II, i.e. $f_5=10\\pm5\\%$ and $R_*=120\\pm30$pc, we need\n$M_1/M_2=8_{-3}^{+4}$ and $R_{1/2}=97^{+25}_{-18}$pc. Such findings are\ncorroborated by the consistency ($\\chi^2=0.5-2$) between the stellar density\nprofile observed and those of simulations having $M_1/M_2$ and $R_{1/2}$ close\nto the emulator's predictions. Ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys will\ngreatly increase the statistics of observed stars and thus stellar halos in\nUFDs. By interpreting such observations with our model, we will provide new\ninsights into the assembly history of UFDs and thus on the early galaxy\nformation process.",

Our best-fitting model has a\nPopIII IMF with a steeper slope, d$N$/d$M \\propto M^{-1.77}$, than the log-flat\nmodels often proposed in the literature, and also relatively high minimum and\nmaximum masses, $M_{\\rm min} = 13.6$Msun and $M_{\\rm max} = 197$Msun.

One possible channel for generating these\nfields involves the pre-conditioning of the circumburst medium: in the early\nafterglow phase, prompt photons streaming ahead of the GRB external shock can\npair produce, seeding the upstream with drifting electron-positron pairs and\ntriggering electromagnetic microinstabilities. To study this process, we employ\n2D periodic particle-in-cell simulations in which a cold electron-proton plasma\nis gradually enriched with warm electron-positron pairs injected at mildly\nrelativistic speeds. We find that continuous pair injection drives the growth\nof large-scale magnetic fields via filamentation-like instabilities; the\ntemporal evolution of the field is self-similar and depends on a single\nparameter, $\\left[\\alpha/(t_{\\rm f} \\omega_{\\rm pi})\\right]^{1/2} t\\omega_{\\rm\npi}$, where $\\alpha$ is the ratio of final pair beam density to background\nplasma density, $t_{\\rm f}$ is the duration of pair injection, and $\\omega_{\\rm\npi}$ is the plasma frequency of background protons. Extrapolating our results\nto parameter regimes realistic for long GRBs, we find that upstream pair\nenrichment generates weak magnetic fields on scales much larger than the proton\nskin depth; for bright bursts, the extrapolated coherence scale at a shock\nradius of $R \\sim 10^{17} \\, {\\rm cm}$ is $\\left<\\lambda_y\\right> \\sim 100 \\;\nc/\\omega_{\\rm pi}$ and the corresponding magnetization is $\\sigma \\sim 10^{-8}$\nfor typical circumburst parameters.

Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG\nis in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the\nrole of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC\nand its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and\nvalley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron\ninteractions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near\nthe valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions.\nUsing self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our\nfindings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and\nvalley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove\nfilling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises,\ncharacterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an\nout-of-plane orientation of the d-vector.

Green valley (GV) galaxies are objects defined on a colour-magnitude\ndiagram, or a colour-mass diagram, as being associated with a transition from a\nstar-forming to a quiescent state (quenching), or vice versa (rejuvenation).\nAims. We studied the sub-millimetre emission of galaxies in the GV and linked\nit with their physical evolutionary properties. Methods. We exploited a\nsemi-analytic model (SAM) for galaxy evolution that includes a detailed\ntreatment of dust production and evolution in galactic contexts. We modelled\nthe observational properties of simulated galaxies by post-processing the SAM\ncatalogues with the spectral synthesis and radiative transfer code GRASIL.\nResults. Our model produces a clear bimodality (and thus a GV) in the\ncolour-mass diagram, although some tensions arise when compared to\nobservations. After introducing a new criterion for identifying the GV in any\ndataset, we find that GV galaxies, at fixed stellar mass, have $250 \\mu$m\nluminosities approximately half those of blue galaxies, while red galaxies\nexhibit luminosities of up to an order of magnitude lower. While specific star\nformation rates drop sharply during quenching, the dust content remains\nrelatively high during the GV transition, powering sub-millimetre emission.\nRejuvenating galaxies in the GV, which were previously red, have experienced a\nstar formation burst that shifts their colour to green, but their $S_{250\\, \\mu\n\\rm m}$ fluxes remain low due to their still low dust masses. Conclusions. Our\ngalaxy evolution model highlights the delay between star formation and dust\nevolution, showing that sub-millimetre emission is not always a safe indicator\nof star formation activity, with quenching (rejuvenating) GV galaxies featuring\nrelatively high (low) sub-millimetre emission.",

The\nthird mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ still suffers from the octant ambiguity, with\nno clear indication of whether it is larger or smaller than $45^\\circ$. The\ndetermination of the leptonic CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$ depends on the neutrino\nmass ordering: for normal ordering the global fit is consistent with CP\nconservation within $1\\sigma$, whereas for inverted ordering CP-violating\nvalues of $\\delta_{CP}$ around $270^\\circ$ are favored against CP conservation\nat more than $3.6\\sigma$. While the present data has in principle\n$2.5$--$3\\sigma$ sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, there are different\ntendencies in the global data that reduce the discrimination power: T2K and\nNOvA appearance data individually favor normal ordering, but they are more\nconsistent with each other for inverted ordering. Conversely, the joint\ndetermination of $|\\Delta m^2_{3\\ell}|$ from global disappearance data prefers\nnormal ordering.

We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most\ndramatic at lower redshifts ($z<1$) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most\nsignificant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen\nacross a large range of wavenumbers ($1.5\\times10^{-3}<k<10^{-1}$ s/km)\nchanging the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN\nfeedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden\nindividual Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become\nobservable at $z \\lesssim 1.0$.

The Jeans models describe\nwell the rotation and velocity dispersion of the LMC disc and we find an\ninclination angle 25.5 deg, line of nodes orientation 124 deg, and an intrinsic\nthickness of the disc 0.23 (minor to major axis ratio).

We use the derived disc\norientation and the Gaia DR3 density image of the LMC to obtain the intrinsic\nshape of the bar. Using these two components as an input to our Schwarzschild\nmodels, we perform orbit integration and weighting in a rotating reference\nframe fixed to the bar, deriving an independent measurement of the LMC bar\npattern speed 11+/-4 km/s/kpc.

    "abstract": "The stellar mass-star formation rate ($\\mathrm{M_*}$-$\\mathrm{SFR}$) plane is\na fundamental diagnostic for distinguishing galaxy populations. However, the\nevolutionary pathways of galaxies within this plane across cosmic time remain\npoorly understood. This study aims to observationally characterize galaxy\nmigration in the $\\mathrm{M_*}$-$\\mathrm{SFR}$ plane using reconstructed star\nformation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z < 4$. Our goal is to provide\ninsights into the physical processes governing star formation and quenching. We\nanalyze a sample of 299,131 galaxies at $z < 4$ from the COSMOS-Web NIRCam\nsurvey ($m_{\\mathrm{F444W}} < 27$, 0.54 deg$^2$). Using non-parametric SFH\nmodeling with CIGALE, we derive physical properties and reconstruct SFHs. To\ntrace galaxy evolution, we define migration vectors, quantifying their\ndirection ($\\Phi_{\\mathrm{dt}}$ [deg]) and velocity norm ($r_{\\mathrm{dt}}$\n[dex/Gyr]) on the $\\mathrm{M_*}$-$\\mathrm{SFR}$ plane. The reliability of these\nvectors is assessed using the Horizon-AGN simulation. We find that\nmain-sequence galaxies exhibit low-amplitude migration with scattered\ndirections, suggesting oscillations within the main sequence. Their progenitors\npredominantly lie on the main sequence 1 Gyr earlier. Starburst galaxies show\nrapid mass assembly ($50\\%$ within 350 Myr) and originate from the main\nsequence, while passive galaxies display uniformly declining SFHs. Massive\npassive galaxies emerge as early as $3.5 < z < 4$, increasing in number density\nover time. Only $<20\\%$ of passive galaxies were starbursts 1 Gyr prior,\nindicating diverse quenching pathways. By reconstructing SFHs to $z < 4$, we\npresent a coherent picture of galaxy migration in the\n$\\mathrm{M_*}$-$\\mathrm{SFR}$ plane, linking evolutionary phases to their star\nformation signatures.",

Upcoming surveys such as $\\textit{Euclid}$ and LSST aim to precisely\nquantify the matter distribution on cosmological scales, making a detailed\nunderstanding of AGN feedback effects essential. Hydrodynamical simulations\nprovide an informative framework for studying these effects, in particular by\nallowing us to vary the parameters that determine the strength of these\nfeedback processes and, consequently, to predict their corresponding impact on\nthe large-scale matter distribution. We use the EAGLE simulations to explore\nhow changes in subgrid viscosity and AGN heating temperature affect the matter\ndistribution, quantified via 2- and 3-point correlation functions, as well as\nhigher order cumulants of the matter distribution. We find that varying\nviscosity has a small impact ($\\approx 10\\%$) on scales larger than $1 h^{-1}$\nMpc, while changes to the AGN heating temperature lead to substantial\ndifferences, with up to $70\\%$ variation in gas clustering on small scales\n($\\lesssim 1 h^{-1}$ Mpc). By examining the suppression of the power spectrum\nas a function of time, we identify the redshift range $z = 1.5 - 1$ as a key\nepoch where AGN feedback begins to dominate in these simulations.

In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness\nin electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their\nhallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low\ntemperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed\nin experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been\nprovided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as\nlarge-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of\ntwo-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in\na non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale\nhybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our\nsimulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of\nlinear-in-$T$ resistivity with a universal `planckian' transport scattering\nrate $\\Gamma_\\mathrm{tr} \\sim k_B T/\\hbar$ that is independent of coupling\nconstants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not\nassociated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of\nmatter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range\ncorrelations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is\nalso observed in several experiments.

We consider three distinct entanglement measures:\nlogarithmic negativity; quantum Fisher information; and, spin squeezing.\nSpecifically, we show that the collective spin operator that maximizes the\nquantum Fisher information can be identified with the \\textit{gapless} mode of\nthe phase transition, while the squeezed direction is that of the\n\\textit{gapped} mode.

    "abstract": "Recent observations and analyses of absorption in quasar spectra suggest a\nrapid drop in the mean free path (MFP) at the late stage of reionization at\n$z\\sim6$. We use the Cosmic Reionization on Computers simulation to examine\npotential biases in observed measurements of the MFP at the late stage of\nreionization, particularly in the presence of a quasar. We analyze three\nsnapshots surrounding the `ankle' point of reionization history, when extended\nneutral patches of the intergalactic medium disappeared in the simulation box.\nSpecifically, these are $z=6.8$ (true MFP $\\approx 0.4$ pMpc), in addition to\n$z=6.1$ (true MFP $\\approx 2$ pMpc) and $z=5.4$ (true MFP $\\approx 6$ pMpc). We\ncompare the inferred MFP $\\lambda_{\\rm mfp}$ from synthetic spectra fits to the\ntrue MFP. We find that the mean Lyman continuum (LyC) profile at $z=6.8$\nchanges significantly with quasar lifetime $t_Q$. We attribute this sensitivity\nto $t_Q$ to a combination of extended neutral IGM patches and the prevalence of\nsmall-scale dense clumps. Consequently, the inferred MFP can be biased by a\nfactor of few depending on $t_Q$. On the other hand, for the $z=6.1$ and\n$z=5.4$ snapshots, the mean LyC profile shows minimal sensitivity to variation\nin $t_Q\\gtrsim 1$ Myr. The inferred MFP in these two cases is accurate to the\n$\\lesssim 30\\%$ level. Our results highlight how modeling systematics can\naffect the inferred MFP, particularly in the regime of small true MFP\n($\\lesssim 0.5$ pMpc). We also discuss the potential of this regime to provide\na testing ground for constraining quasar lifetimes from LyC profiles.",

    "abstract": "Recent works suggest that, in multiplanetary systems, a close-in exoplanet\ncan sometimes avoid becoming tidally locked to its host star if it is captured\ninto a secular spin-orbit resonance with a companion planet. In such a\nresonance, the planet remains at a sub-synchronous spin rate and an appreciable\nobliquity (the planet's spin-orbit misalignment angle). However, many of these\nworks have only considered planets with fluid-like rheologies. Recent\nobservations suggest that planets up to a few Earth masses may be rocky and\nthus may have an appreciable rigidity. In this work, we study the spin-orbit\ndynamics of such rigid planets using a linear dissipative tidal model and not\nenforcing principal axis rotation about the body's shortest principal axis. We\nidentify a new class of spin-orbit resonances when the planet spins at twice\nits orbital frequency. These resonances exist at nonzero obliquity and\nspontaneously excite non-principal-axis rotation upon resonance capture. While\nthese resonances eventually disappear as tidal dissipation damps the obliquity\nto zero (and the body returns to principal-axis rotation), they still modify\nthe spin evolutionary history of the planet. Such resonances may enhance the\nprevalence of secular spin-orbit resonances in exoplanetary systems.",

This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings\nwithout requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising\nprocess that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random\naugmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual\nfeatures and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we\nenable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive\nselectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex.

We investigate the influence of bias\non interval lengths of two different types of adjustments -- symmetric\nadjustments, the conventional method where both sides of the interval are\nadjusted equally, and asymmetric adjustments, a more flexible method where the\ninterval can be adjusted unequally in positive or negative directions.

To resolve these problems, we introduce an\nimage-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained\nknowledge from 2D VTON models to 3D while improving cross-view consistency. (1)\nSpecifically, we propose a personalized diffusion model that utilizes low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to incorporate personalized information into\npre-trained 2D VTON models. To achieve effective LoRA training, we introduce a\nreference-driven image editing approach that enables the simultaneous editing\nof multi-view images while ensuring consistency. (2) Furthermore, we propose a\npersona-aware 3DGS editing framework to facilitate effective editing while\nmaintaining consistent cross-view appearance and high-quality 3D geometry. (3)\nAdditionally, we have established a new 3D VTON benchmark, 3D-VTONBench, which\nfacilitates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative 3D VTON evaluations.\nThrough extensive experiments and comparative analyses with existing methods,\nthe proposed \\OM has demonstrated superior fidelity and advanced editing\ncapabilities, affirming its effectiveness for 3D VTON.",

In order to\npreserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for\npaired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and\nthe generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling\nPreference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper.

This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? How do they\nperform compared to humans? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair\noutcome? What is the role of natural language in strategic interaction? How do\ncharacteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These\nquestions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of\nintegrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as\nonline retail platforms and recommender systems. To answer these questions, we\nintroduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential,\nlanguage-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base\nfamilies of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and\neconomic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the\ngame outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for\ninteraction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM\nvs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional\ndataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we\ndemonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the\nbehavior of LLM-based agents in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents\nin both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the\neffect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of\nagents.

Efforts to improve instruction tuning\noften focus on higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, typically\nrequiring data filtering with proprietary LLMs or human annotation. In this\npaper, we take a different approach by proposing SFTMix, a novel Mixup-based\nrecipe that elevates LLM instruction tuning beyond the conventional NTP\nparadigm, without relying on well-curated datasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit\nuneven confidence across the semantic representation space, we argue that\nexamples with different confidence levels should play distinct roles in\ninstruction tuning--confident data is prone to overfitting, while unconfident\ndata is harder to generalize. Based on this insight, SFTMix leverages training\ndynamics to identify examples with varying confidence levels, interpolates them\nto bridge the confidence gap, and applies a Mixup-based regularization to\nsupport learning on these additional, interpolated examples. By propagating\nsupervision signals across confidence regions and encouraging linear behavior\nbetween them, SFTMix mitigates overfitting in confident examples while\nenhancing generalization in unconfident ones.

Traditionally, low-rank approximations\nare considered in unitary invariant norms, however, recently element-wise\napproximations have also received significant attention in the literature. In\nthis paper, we propose an accelerated alternating minimization algorithm for\nsolving the problem of low-rank approximation of matrices in the Chebyshev\nnorm. Through the numerical evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed procedure for large-scale problems. We also theoretically investigate\nthe alternating minimization method and introduce the notion of a $2$-way\nalternance of rank $r$.

Among the many physical processes at play, we focus on fluid\ncompressibility, modeled using the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state for a\nhomentropic Euler fluid. To capture such extreme motion, with Mach numbers\nrelative to ambient sound speed greater than one during the final stages of\nimplosion, requires methods beyond the classic approaches of Rayleigh and\nGilmore.

To capture high\nMach number motion and resolve dynamics in the sonoluminescence regime, we\nemployed the well-established uniform bubble approximation for the ideal gas\ninside the bubble.

Although compressibility slows down the collapse, these bubbles reach\nvelocities exceeding the ambient speed of sound of the surrounding fluid.

However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness\nof their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize\ntext-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite\ntheir utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased\ncomputational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for\nGUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform\npixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can\naccurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their\ncoordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple\nrecipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the\nLLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual\ngrounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so\nfar, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M\nscreenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding\nmodel for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three\ncategories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround\nsubstantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by\nup to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art\nagents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input\nwhile ours only uses visual perception.

    "abstract": "Deformable image registration aims to precisely align medical images from\ndifferent modalities or times. Traditional deep learning methods, while\neffective, often lack interpretability, real-time observability and adjustment\ncapacity during registration inference. Denoising diffusion models present an\nalternative by reformulating registration as iterative image denoising.\nHowever, existing diffusion registration approaches do not fully harness\ncapabilities, neglecting the critical sampling phase that enables continuous\nobservability during the inference. Hence, we introduce DiffuseReg, an\ninnovative diffusion-based method that denoises deformation fields instead of\nimages for improved transparency. We also propose a novel denoising network\nupon Swin Transformer, which better integrates moving and fixed images with\ndiffusion time step throughout the denoising process. Furthermore, we enhance\ncontrol over the denoising registration process with a novel similarity\nconsistency regularization. Experiments on ACDC datasets demonstrate DiffuseReg\noutperforms existing diffusion registration methods by 1.32 in Dice score. The\nsampling process in DiffuseReg enables real-time output observability and\nadjustment unmatched by previous deep models.",

Since the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) features\nimprint at decoupling, they are expected in the parity-odd galaxy 4PCF, and so\ndetecting them would be an additional piece of evidence that the signal is\ngenuine. We demonstrate in a toy parity-violating model how the BAO imprint on\nthe parity-odd 4PCF.

The GSM8K\nbenchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on\ngrade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has\nsignificantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their\nmathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions\nabout the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we\nconduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome\nthe limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved\nbenchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a\ndiverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,\nproviding key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning\ncapabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable\nvariance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.\nSpecifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical\nvalues in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show\nthat their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a\nquestion increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs\ncannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from\ntheir training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question\ncauses significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art\nmodels, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed\nfor the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of\nLLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.",

One of the\noldest solutions proposed for this problem is a principle that states that an\nevent with probability close to 1 nearly certainly occurs in a single trial of\nan experiment. This principle is now called $\\textit{Cournot' principle}$.\n  Cournot's principle was first formulated in the context of classical\nprobability, in which the probability of any event is given, and the\n$\\textit{product rule}$, i.e., the rule that the probability that two events\noccur in two separated trials is the product of their probabilities, can be\ndeduced. On the contrary, in the modern measure-theoretic approach to\nprobability, probability measures and experiments are separate entities that\nmust be related in an appropriate way, and the product rule cannot be deduced.\n  In this paper, a version of Cournot's principle suitable for\nmeasure-theoretic probability is proposed. Therefore, the principle is\nreformulated as a criterion for relating probability measures and experiments,\nand the product rule is explicitly stated.\n  In spite of the vagueness of the notions involved, the new version is\nformulated in a rigorous manner and an exact result, namely, that at most one\nprobability measure can be related to an experiment, is rigorously proven.",

Our framework,\nX-Cluster: eXploratory Clustering, treats text as a reasoning proxy: it\nconcurrently scans the entire image collection, proposes candidate criteria in\nnatural language, and groups images into meaningful clusters per criterion. To\nevaluate progress, we release COCO-4c and Food-4c benchmarks, each annotated\nwith four grouping criteria. Experiments show that X-Cluster effectively\nreveals meaningful partitions and enables downstream applications such as bias\ndiscovery and social media image popularity analysis.

    "abstract": "Understanding the roles of disorder and superconducting phase fluctuation in\nsuperconductivity has been a long-standing challenge. For example, while the\nphase fluctuation is expected to destroy the superconductivity of intrinsically\ndisordered two-dimensional (2D) superconductors at any finite temperatures,\nthere have been ample experimental evidences showing robust long-range\nsuperconducting order in ultra-thin films and atomic sheets. The observed\nunique superconducting-insulating transition in 2D samples with sufficiently\nlarge amount of disorder also goes beyond the conventional theoretical\nparadigm. Here we develop a self-consistent thermodynamic theory of the\nsuperconducting gap and phase fluctuation in disordered 2D superconductors,\nstarting from a purely microscopic model. It incorporates both quantum and\nthermal phase fluctuations in the presence of the long-range Coulomb\ninteractions. Our numerical simulation based on the developed theory\nsuccessfully proves a long-range superconducting order in 2D limit even when\ntemperature is increased away from zero, while the gradually emerging large\nthermal phase fluctuations with further increasing temperature destroy the\nsuperconducting gap. On the other hand, the inhomogeneous quantum phase\nfluctuations with increasing disorder result in a mixed state of\nsuperconducting and normal-state islands, thereby reducing $T_c$. But a robust\nsuperconductivity can survive at low temperature even at high disorder, giving\nrise to the prerequisite of the superconducting-insulating transition. More\nimportantly, our theory shows that the phase fluctuation can be suppressed by\nincreasing carrier density, leading to a carrier density-dependent $T_c$. These\nfindings explain many of the recently observed experimental features of the\nsuperconductors in 2D limit and can potentially shed light on the understanding\nof high-$T_c$ superconductors.",

We simulate high-velocity clouds (HVCs) with the FLASH\nhydrodynamic code and track the ionization and recombination of all ionization\nlevels of oxygen as a function of time. We calculate the O VI/oxygen ratio\n($f_{\\rm O VI}$) in our dynamic NEI clouds, finding that it differs\nsignificantly from that in static gas. We find that O VI exists in cool,\nmedium, and hot gas in the clouds. As such, it traces all of the hydrogen\nrather than merely the ionized hydrogen. The total quantity of hydrogen along a\ntypical observed line of sight through a cloud can be estimated from the\nobserved O VI column density, metallicity, and our $f_{\\rm O VI}$. We provide\nthe simulations' $f_{\\rm O VI}$, a prescription for finding $f_{\\rm O VI}$ for\nobserved dynamic clouds, and a methodology for calculating the total hydrogen\ncolumn density from this $f_{\\rm O VI}$ and an observed O VI column density. As\nexamples, we use our $f_{\\rm O VI}$ to estimate the total hydrogen column\ndensities along various observed sight lines through two HVCs, Complex C and\nthe Magellanic Stream, finding that these clouds contain more material than the\nprevious lower limits. We also extend this analysis to {low-redshift}\nintergalactic O VI clouds, finding that they contain several times more\nbaryonic material than previously thought and therefore may account for a\nsignificant fraction of the Universe's baryons.",

These findings undermine FVD's\nreliability and show that FVD falls short as a standalone metric for video\ngeneration evaluation.

The field has\nseen promising progress with demonstrations of early QEC and real-time decoded\nexperiments. As quantum computers advance towards demonstrating a universal\nfault-tolerant logical gate set, implementing scalable and low-latency\nreal-time decoding will be crucial to prevent the backlog problem, avoiding an\nexponential slowdown and maintaining a fast logical clock rate. Here, we\ndemonstrate low-latency feedback with a scalable FPGA decoder integrated into\nthe control system of a superconducting quantum processor. We perform an\n8-qubit stability experiment with up to $25$ decoding rounds and a mean\ndecoding time per round below $1$ ${\\mu}s$, showing that we avoid the backlog\nproblem even on superconducting hardware with the strictest speed requirements.\nWe observe logical error suppression as the number of decoding rounds is\nincreased. We also implement and time a fast-feedback experiment demonstrating\na decoding response time of $9.6$ ${\\mu}s$ for a total of $9$ measurement\nrounds. The decoder throughput and latency developed in this work, combined\nwith continued device improvements, unlock the next generation of experiments\nthat go beyond purely keeping logical qubits alive and into demonstrating\nbuilding blocks of fault-tolerant computation, such as lattice surgery and\nmagic state teleportation.",

In\nthis paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM)\nframework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health\nprediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge of pretrained LLMs\nand enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions.\nInstruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources,\nensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by\nan average of 4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates\nzero-shot predictions for new tasks.

In this context, we define the\nindependence number of a network as the maximum value of $k$ such that the\nnetwork is $k$-independent. This definition is closely related to widely\nstudied combinatorial designs, such as \"$k$-strength covering arrays\", also\nknown as Boolean sets with all $k$-projections surjective. Our motivation\narises from understanding the relationship between a network's interaction\ngraph and its fixed points, which deepens the classical paradigm of research in\nthis direction by incorporating a particular structure on the set of fixed\npoints, beyond merely observing their quantity. Specifically, among the results\nof this paper, we highlight a condition on the in-degree of the interaction\ngraph for a network to be $k$-independent, we show that all regulatory networks\nare at most $n/2$-independent, and we construct $k$-independent networks for\nall possible $k$ in the case of monotone networks with a complete interaction\ngraph.",

Recently, experimental observations have also confirmed such topological\nstates of matter. However, the topological electronic properties in multilayer\nmoir\\'e superlattices remain to be further explored. In twisted TMDs\nheterotrilayers, the realization of moir\\'e potential with various symmetries\nbecomes feasible. Here, we demonstrate that twisted trilayer TMDs can enter a\ntopological insulator phase under the influence of moir\\'e potential with\n${C_6}$ symmetry. Specifically, we built two types of trilayer\nheterostructures, where the low-energy valence band electrons are contributed\nby the middle layer. In the AA-stacked moir\\'e WS$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$\nheterotrilayers where only the middle layer is twisted, the maxima of the\nmoir\\'e potential exhibits an approximate ${C_6}$ symmetry. The $C_6$ symmetry\neffectively compensates for the spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the\nWSe$_2$ layer, leading to a twist-angle-dependent topological phase transition.\nLeveraging a Green's function approach, we calculate the local state density of\nedge states at topological minigaps, confirming their nature as moir\\'e edge\nstates. In the helical twisted AA-stacked moir\\'e MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$\nheterotrilayers, we observed a mosaic pattern of topological and trivial\ninsulators. The emergence of topological mosaic is attributed to the maxima of\nthe local moir\\'e potential possessing $C_6$ symmetry.

    "abstract": "With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a\ncost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation\nquality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability\ngap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the\nlack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of\nreference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval,\na novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted\nreferences. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference\nshould maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated.\nSpecifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the\nrevised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms\ntraditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use\nLLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks.\nMore importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the\nclassical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional\nreferences and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also\nconducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of\ninference cost, and reference relevance.",

    "abstract": "Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute\nbudget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total\nnumber of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\ntime with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that\nreuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where\nwe resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and\nCyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple language model checkpoints across various\ncompute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B.",

Disregarding the \"hidden\" symmetries, we can upper bound the dimensions\nof the orbit and the standard Lie algebras, and the dimensions of the\nassociated invariant subspaces are determined via explicit character formulas.\nTo finish, we conjecture that (for most graphs) the standard Lie algebras have\nonly components that are either exponential or that grow, at most, polynomially\nwith the system size.

In a general model, items are stored at vertices and\neach vertex $v$ has a buffer with $b(v)$ slots. Given a route for each item\ntoward its destination, the Deadlock Safety Problem asks whether the current\nstate is safe, i.e., it is possible to deliver each item at its destination, or\nis bound to deadlock, i.e., any sequence of moves will end up with a set of\nitems stalled. While when $b \\geq 2$ the problem is solvable in polynomial time\nbuilding upon a nice characterization of YES/NO-instances, it is NP-hard on\nquite simple graphs as grids when $b=1$ and on trees when $b\\leq 3$. We improve\non these results by means of two new tools, weak deadlock sets and wise states.\nWe show that for general networks and $b$ a state that is wise and without weak\ndeadlock sets -- this can be recognized in polynomial time -- is safe: this is\nindeed a strengthening of the result for $b\\geq 2$. We sharpen this result for\ntrees, where we show that a wise state is safe if and only if it has no weak\ndeadlock set.

    "abstract": "Spin-torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is a promising\nemerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology with wide applications. However,\nthe data recovery of STT-MRAM is affected by the diversity of channel raw bit\nerror rate (BER) across different dies caused by process variations, as well as\nthe unknown resistance offset due to temperature change. Therefore, it is\ncritical to develop effective decoding algorithms of error correction codes\n(ECCs) for STT-MRAM. In this article, we first propose a neural bit-flipping\n(BF) decoding algorithm, which can share the same trellis representation as the\nstate-of-the-art neural decoding algorithms, such as the neural belief\npropagation (NBP) and neural offset min-sum (NOMS) algorithm. Hence, a neural\nnetwork (NN) decoder with a uniform architecture but different NN parameters\ncan realize all these neural decoding algorithms. Based on such a unified NN\ndecoder architecture, we further propose a novel deep-learning (DL)-based\nadaptive decoding algorithm whose decoding complexity can be adjusted according\nto the change of the channel conditions of STT-MRAM. Extensive experimental\nevaluation results demonstrate that the proposed neural decoders can greatly\nimprove the performance over the standard decoders, with similar decoding\nlatency and energy consumption. Moreover, the DL-based adaptive decoder can\nwork well over different channel conditions of STT-MRAM irrespective of the\nunknown resistance offset, with a 50% reduction of the decoding latency and\nenergy consumption compared to the fixed decoder.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order\npositivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme\nensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free\n(DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and\npressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao,\nM. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the\nMHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic\nsubsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these\nstructure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a\npositivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a\nfinite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem\nvia Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that\nretains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and\npressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization\n(GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the\nmagnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that\nconserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system\nis efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since\nthe CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and\ninternal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the\nfinite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus\nis on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several\nchallenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with\nhigh Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high\nresolution.",

Our combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs\nwith improved diversity, accelerating our base model by 10-18x (230/435ms\nlatency for 32 second mono/stereo 44.1kHz, 15x faster than comparable SOTA) --\nthe fastest high-quality TTM to our knowledge.

Each passage through the disk shocks and\ncompresses gas ahead of the star, which subsequently re-expands above the disk\nas a quasi-spherical cloud. We present spherically symmetric Monte Carlo\nradiation transport simulations which follow the production of photons behind\nthe radiation-mediated shock, Comptonization by hot electrons, and the eventual\nescape of the radiation through the expanding debris. Such one-dimension\ncalculations are approximately justified for thin disks, through which the star\nof radius $R_{\\star}$ passes faster than the shocked gas can flow around the\nstar. For collision speeds $v_{\\rm coll} \\gtrsim 0.15 c$ and disk surface\ndensities $\\Sigma \\sim 10^{3}$ g cm$^{-2}$ characteristic of those encountered\nby stellar orbits consistent with QPE recurrence times, the predicted transient\nlight curves exhibit peak luminosities $\\gtrsim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and\nComptonized quasi-thermal (Wien-like) spectra which peak at energies $h\\nu \\sim\n100$ eV, broadly consistent with QPE properties. For these conditions, gas and\nradiation are out of equilibrium and the emission temperature is harder than\nthe blackbody value due to inefficient photon production behind the shock.\nAlternatively, for higher disk densities and/or lower shock velocities, QPE\nemission could instead represent the comparatively brief phase shortly after\nshock break-out, though in this case the bulk of the radiation is thermalized\nand occurs in the ultraviolet instead of the X-ray band. In either scenario,\nreproducing the observed eruption properties (duration, luminosity,\ntemperature) requires a large radius $R_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10R_{\\odot}$, which may\npoint to inflation of the star's atmosphere from repeated collisions.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved\nnotable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to\nexcessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding. For lossless LLM\ndecoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique\nchallenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct\ntoken sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more\nstringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM\nmust be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To\nalleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the\ndraft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to\nreduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named\nAtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K\nalignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed\nsampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted\nsequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we\npropose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.\nEmpirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed\nsignificantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x\nspeedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5x speedup under relaxed\nsampling verification.

Therefore, effective error correction codes (ECCs) are\nnecessary for correcting memory cell errors. Meanwhile, the design of channel\nquantizer plays a critical role in supporting error correction coding for\nSTT-MRAM. In this work, we propose a union bound analysis which can accurately\npredict the word error rates (WERs) of ECCs with maximum-likelihood (ML)\ndecoding over the quantized STT-MRAM channel. The derived bound provides a\ntheoretical tool for comparing the performance of ECCs with different\nquantization schemes at very low error rate levels without resorting to lengthy\ncomputer simulations.

However, progress in learning\nuniversal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite its\nimportance and practicality. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for\nbuilding universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream\ntasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding\nBenchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question\nanswering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets,\nincluding 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets covering both in-distribution\nand out-of-distribution tasks, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model ->\nVector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art\nvision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike\nprevious models such as CLIP and BLIP, which encodes text or images\nindependently without any task instruction, VLM2Vec can process any combination\nof images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task\ninstructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on SoTA VLMs like Phi-3.5-V,\nLLaVA-1.6 and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split.

The approach leverages Deep Kernel Learning to model the systems'\none-step evolution with uncertainty quantification and constructs a\nfinite-state abstraction as an Interval MDP (IMDP). By focusing on safety\nproperties expressed in safe linear temporal logic (safe LTL), we develop an\nalgorithm that computes the maximally permissive set of safe policies on the\nIMDP, ensuring avoidance of unsafe states. The algorithms soundness and\ncomputational complexity are demonstrated through theoretical proofs and\nexperiments on nonlinear systems, including a high-dimensional autonomous\nspacecraft scenario.",

In this paper, we focus on the\nsecurity aspect of network slicing over a deep transfer reinforcement learning\n(DTRL) enabled scenario. We first demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-enabled jamming attack exposes potential risks. In particular, the\nattacker can intelligently jam resource blocks (RBs) reserved for slices by\nmonitoring transmission signals and perturbing the assigned resources. Then, we\npropose a DRL-driven mitigation model to mitigate the intelligent attacker.\nSpecifically, the defense mechanism generates interference on unallocated RBs\nwhere another antenna is used for transmitting powerful signals. This causes\nthe jammer to consider these RBs as allocated RBs and generate interference for\nthose instead of the allocated RBs. The analysis revealed that the intelligent\nDRL-enabled jamming attack caused a significant 50% degradation in network\nthroughput and 60% increase in latency in comparison with the no-attack\nscenario. However, with the implemented mitigation measures, we observed 80%\nimprovement in network throughput and 70% reduction in latency in comparison to\nthe under-attack scenario.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, lidars have become a cornerstone of robotics state\nestimation and perception thanks to their ability to provide accurate geometric\ninformation about their surroundings in the form of 3D scans. Unfortunately,\nmost of nowadays lidars do not take snapshots of the environment but sweep the\nenvironment over a period of time (typically around 100 ms). Such a\nrolling-shutter-like mechanism introduces motion distortion into the collected\nlidar scan, thus hindering downstream perception applications. In this paper,\nwe present a novel method for motion distortion correction of lidar data by\ntightly coupling lidar with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. The\nmotivation of this work is a map-free dynamic object detection based on lidar.\nThe proposed lidar data undistortion method relies on continuous preintegrated\nof IMU measurements that allow parameterising the sensors' continuous 6-DoF\ntrajectory using solely eleven discrete state variables (biases, initial\nvelocity, and gravity direction). The undistortion consists of feature-based\ndistance minimisation of point-to-line and point-to-plane residuals in a\nnon-linear least-square formulation. Given undistorted geometric data over a\nshort temporal window, the proposed pipeline computes the spatiotemporal normal\nvector of each of the lidar points. The temporal component of the normals is a\nproxy for the corresponding point's velocity, therefore allowing for\nlearning-free dynamic object classification without the need for registration\nin a global reference frame. We demonstrate the soundness of the proposed\nmethod and its different components using public datasets and compare them with\nstate-of-the-art lidar-inertial state estimation and dynamic object detection\nalgorithms.",

Experiments have\nbeen performed on text-to-music generation and music-style transfer tasks using\nopen-source instrumental recording data. The results demonstrate that by\nextending StableAudio, a pre-trained text-controlled DiT model, our approach\nenables superior melody-controlled editing while retaining good text-to-music\ngeneration performance.

    "abstract": "The detection of malicious social bots has become a crucial task, as bots can\nbe easily deployed and manipulated to spread disinformation, promote conspiracy\nmessages, and more. Most existing approaches utilize graph neural networks\n(GNNs)to capture both user profle and structural features,achieving promising\nprogress. However, they still face limitations including the expensive training\non large underlying graph, the performance degration when similar neighborhood\npatterns' assumption preferred by GNNs is not satisfied, and the dynamic\nfeatures of bots in a highly adversarial context. Motivated by these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a method named BSG4Bot with an intuition that\nGNNs training on Biased SubGraphs can improve both performance and time/space\nefficiency in bot detection. Specifically, BSG4Bot first pre-trains a\nclassifier on node features efficiently to define the node similarities, and\nconstructs biased subgraphs by combining the similarities computed by the\npre-trained classifier and the node importances computed by Personalized\nPageRank (PPR scores). BSG4Bot then introduces a heterogeneous GNN over the\nconstructed subgraphs to detect bots effectively and efficiently. The\nrelatively stable features, including the content category and temporal\nactivity features, are explored and incorporated into BSG4Bot after preliminary\nverification on sample data. The extensive experimental studies show that\nBSG4Bot outperforms the state-of-the-art bot detection methods, while only\nneeding nearly 1/5 training time.",

However, existing methods\nrely on prior knowledge of problem parameters to determine stepsizes, resulting\nin significant effort in tuning stepsizes when these parameters are unknown. In\nthis paper, we propose two novel tuning-free algorithms, D-TFBO and S-TFBO.\nD-TFBO employs a double-loop structure with stepsizes adaptively adjusted by\nthe \"inverse of cumulative gradient norms\" strategy. S-TFBO features a simpler\nfully single-loop structure that updates three variables simultaneously with a\ntheory-motivated joint design of adaptive stepsizes for all variables. We\nprovide a comprehensive convergence analysis for both algorithms and show that\nD-TFBO and S-TFBO respectively require $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ and\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\log^4(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ iterations to find an\n$\\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, (nearly) matching their well-tuned\ncounterparts using the information of problem parameters. Experiments on\nvarious problems show that our methods achieve performance comparable to\nexisting well-tuned approaches, while being more robust to the selection of\ninitial stepsizes.

Central to this\napproach is the construction of generative RB spaces that provide rapidly\nconvergent approximations of the solution manifold. We introduce a generative\nsnapshot method to generate significantly larger sets of snapshots from a small\ninitial set of solution snapshots. This method leverages multivariate nonlinear\ntransformations to enrich the RB spaces, allowing for a more accurate\napproximation of the solution manifold than commonly used techniques such as\nproper orthogonal decomposition and greedy sampling. The key components of our\napproach include (i) a Galerkin projection of the full order model onto the\ngenerative RB space to form the reduced order model; (ii) a posteriori error\nestimates to certify the accuracy of the reduced order model; and (iii) an\noffline-online decomposition to separate the computationally intensive model\nconstruction, performed once during the offline stage, from the real-time model\nevaluations performed many times during the online stage. The error estimates\nallow us to efficiently explore the parameter space and select parameter points\nthat maximize the accuracy of the reduced order model.

    "abstract": "Transferability of adversarial examples is a well-known property that\nendangers all classification models, even those that are only accessible\nthrough black-box queries. Prior work has shown that an ensemble of models is\nmore resilient to transferability: the probability that an adversarial example\nis effective against most models of the ensemble is low. Thus, most ongoing\nresearch focuses on improving ensemble diversity. Another line of prior work\nhas shown that Lipschitz continuity of the models can make models more robust\nsince it limits how a model's output changes with small input perturbations. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of Lipschitz continuity on transferability\nrates. We show that although a lower Lipschitz constant increases the\nrobustness of a single model, it is not as beneficial in training robust\nensembles as it increases the transferability rate of adversarial examples\nacross models in the ensemble. Therefore, we introduce LOTOS, a new training\nparadigm for ensembles, which counteracts this adverse effect. It does so by\npromoting orthogonality among the top-$k$ sub-spaces of the transformations of\nthe corresponding affine layers of any pair of models in the ensemble. We\ntheoretically show that $k$ does not need to be large for convolutional layers,\nwhich makes the computational overhead negligible. Through various experiments,\nwe show LOTOS increases the robust accuracy of ensembles of ResNet-18 models by\n$6$ percentage points (p.p) against black-box attacks on CIFAR-10. It is also\ncapable of combining with the robustness of prior state-of-the-art methods for\ntraining robust ensembles to enhance their robust accuracy by $10.7$ p.p.",

Roughness elements\nattenuate tones in the acoustic field and, for the higher Reynolds number,\nsuppress them. Through Fourier decomposition and spectral POD analysis of\nstreamwise velocity data, dominating structures have been identified. Further,\nthe coupling between structures generated by surface roughness and instability\nmodes (Kelvin-Helmholtz) of shear layer has been identified through stability\nanalysis, suggesting stabilisation mechanisms by which the sound generation by\nthe airfoil is reduced by the roughness elements.",

Our algorithm, the decentralized projected\nRiemannian gradient descent, iteratively performs local updates using projected\nRiemannian gradient descent and a consensus step via weighted Frechet mean.\nTheoretically, we establish linear variance reduction for the consensus step.\nBuilding on this, we prove a dynamic regret bound of order ${\\cal\nO}(\\sqrt{T(1+P_T)}/\\sqrt{(1-\\sigma_2(W))})$, where $T$ is the time horizon,\n$P_T$ represents the path variation measuring nonstationarity, and\n$\\sigma_2(W)$ measures the network connectivity. The weighted Frechet mean in\nour algorithm incurs a minimization problem, which can be computationally\nexpensive. To further alleviate this cost, we propose a simplified consensus\nstep with a closed-form, replacing the weighted Frechet mean. We then establish\nlinear variance reduction for this alternative and prove that the decentralized\nalgorithm, even with this simple consensus step, achieves the same dynamic\nregret bound. Finally, we validate our approach with experiments on\nnonstationary decentralized Frechet mean computation over hyperbolic spaces and\nthe space of symmetric positive definite matrices, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our methods.",

The former is attributed to the correlation between\nconvection-driven dynamo and stellar volume, while the latter suggests the\noperation of solar-type flare mechanisms in PMS stars. 3) We find that most PMS\nstars exhibit minor long-term baseline variations, indicating the absence of\nintrinsic magnetic dynamo cycles or observational mitigation of cycles by\nsaturated PMS X-rays. 4) We conclude that X-ray mega-flares are ubiquitous\nphenomena in PMS stars, which suggests that all protoplanetary disks and\nnascent planets are subject to violent high-energy emission and particle\nirradiation events.",

    "abstract": "Classical results in statistical learning typically consider two extreme\ndata-generating models: i.i.d. instances from an unknown distribution, or fully\nadversarial instances, often much more challenging statistically. To bridge the\ngap between these models, recent work introduced the smoothed framework, in\nwhich at each iteration an adversary generates instances from a distribution\nconstrained to have density bounded by $\\sigma^{-1}$ compared to some fixed\nbase measure $\\mu$. This framework interpolates between the i.i.d. and\nadversarial cases, depending on the value of $\\sigma$. For the classical online\nprediction problem, most prior results in smoothed online learning rely on the\narguably strong assumption that the base measure $\\mu$ is known to the learner,\ncontrasting with standard settings in the PAC learning or consistency\nliterature. We consider the general agnostic problem in which the base measure\nis unknown and values are arbitrary. Along this direction, Block et al. showed\nthat empirical risk minimization has sublinear regret under the well-specified\nassumption. We propose an algorithm R-Cover based on recursive coverings which\nis the first to guarantee sublinear regret for agnostic smoothed online\nlearning without prior knowledge of $\\mu$. For classification, we prove that\nR-Cover has adaptive regret $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{dT/\\sigma})$ for function classes\nwith VC dimension $d$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

However, applying GS\nrepresentation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges\nthat must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics.\nSpecifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using\nrange-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers\nonto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with\nlocal affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian\nRepresentation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key\nLiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external\nfactors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g.,\ndynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously\nre-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically\navailable large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit\nmesh or implicit NeRF.

    "abstract": "This thesis addresses the challenge of understanding Neural Networks through\nthe lens of their most fundamental component: the weights, which encapsulate\nthe learned information and determine the model behavior. At the core of this\nthesis is a fundamental question: Can we learn general, task-agnostic\nrepresentations from populations of Neural Network models? The key contribution\nof this thesis to answer that question are hyper-representations, a\nself-supervised method to learn representations of NN weights. Work in this\nthesis finds that trained NN models indeed occupy meaningful structures in the\nweight space, that can be learned and used. Through extensive experiments, this\nthesis demonstrates that hyper-representations uncover model properties, such\nas their performance, state of training, or hyperparameters. Moreover, the\nidentification of regions with specific properties in hyper-representation\nspace allows to sample and generate model weights with targeted properties.\nThis thesis demonstrates applications for fine-tuning, and transfer learning to\ngreat success. Lastly, it presents methods that allow hyper-representations to\ngeneralize beyond model sizes, architectures, and tasks. The practical\nimplications of that are profound, as it opens the door to foundation models of\nNeural Networks, which aggregate and instantiate their knowledge across models\nand architectures. Ultimately, this thesis contributes to the deeper\nunderstanding of Neural Networks by investigating structures in their weights\nwhich leads to more interpretable, efficient, and adaptable models. By laying\nthe groundwork for representation learning of NN weights, this research\ndemonstrates the potential to change the way Neural Networks are developed,\nanalyzed, and used.",

The theme of this\nsurvey is that many important constructions on Com-algebras are given by taking\nthe derived circle product with well chosen right Com-modules. Examples of\nconstructions arising this way include the tensor product of a based space K\nwith such an algebra I, and TQ(I), the Topological Andre-Quillen homology\nspectrum of I. We then show how filtrations of right Com-modules can be used to\nfilter such constructions. A natural decreasing filtration on right\nCom-modules, when specialized to the Com-bimodule Com, defines the augmentation\nideal tower of I, built out of the extended powers of TQ(I). A natural\nincreasing filtration on right Com-modules, when specialized to the right\nCom-module used to define TQ(I), defines a filtration on TQ(I) built out of I\nand the spaces in the Lie cooperad. There are two versions of this in the\nliterature -- by the author and by Behrens and Rezk -- and our setting here\nmakes it easy to prove that these agree.

A\nsignificant challenge in DD is the dependency between the distilled dataset and\nthe neural network (NN) architecture used. Training a different NN architecture\nwith a distilled dataset distilled using a specific architecture often results\nin diminished trainning performance for other architectures. This paper\nintroduces MetaDD, designed to enhance the generalizability of DD across\nvarious NN architectures. Specifically, MetaDD partitions distilled data into\nmeta features (i.e., the data's common characteristics that remain consistent\nacross different NN architectures) and heterogeneous features (i.e., the data's\nunique feature to each NN architecture). Then, MetaDD employs an\narchitecture-invariant loss function for multi-architecture feature alignment,\nwhich increases meta features and reduces heterogeneous features in distilled\ndata. As a low-memory consumption component, MetaDD can be seamlessly\nintegrated into any DD methodology. Experimental results demonstrate that\nMetaDD significantly improves performance across various DD methods.

Technically, an\nInterval Group S6 Mechanism (IGSM) is developed as the core component, which\npartitions high-dimensional features into multiple non-overlapping groups at\nintervals, and then integrates a unidirectional S6 for each group with a\nspecific scanning direction to achieve non-redundant sequence modeling.\nCompared to conventional applying multi-directional scanning to all bands, this\ngrouping strategy leverages the complementary strengths of different scanning\ndirections while decreasing computational costs. To adequately capture the\nspatial-spectral contextual information, an Interval Group Spatial-Spectral\nBlock (IGSSB) is introduced, in which two IGSM-based spatial and spectral\noperators are cascaded to characterize the global spatial-spectral relationship\nalong the spatial and spectral dimensions, respectively. IGroupSS-Mamba is\nconstructed as a hierarchical structure stacked by multiple IGSSB blocks,\nintegrating a pixel aggregation-based downsampling strategy for multiscale\nspatial-spectral semantic learning from shallow to deep stages. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that IGroupSS-Mamba outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Selectively processing noisy utterances while effectively disregarding\nspeech-specific elements poses no considerable challenge for humans, as they\nexhibit remarkable cognitive abilities to separate semantically significant\ncontent from speech-specific noise (i.e. filled pauses, disfluencies, and\nrestarts). These abilities may be driven by mechanisms based on acquired\ngrammatical rules that compose abstract syntactic-semantic structures within\nutterances. Segments without syntactic and semantic significance are\nconsistently disregarded in these structures. The structures, in tandem with\nlexis, likely underpin language comprehension and thus facilitate effective\ncommunication. In our study, grounded in linguistically motivated experiments,\nwe investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively perform\nanalogical speech comprehension tasks. In particular, we examine the ability of\nLLMs to extract well-structured utterances from transcriptions of noisy\ndialogues. We conduct two evaluation experiments in the Polish language\nscenario, using a~dataset presumably unfamiliar to LLMs to mitigate the risk of\ndata contamination. Our results show that not all extracted utterances are\ncorrectly structured, indicating that either LLMs do not fully acquire\nsyntactic-semantic rules or they acquire them but cannot apply them\neffectively. We conclude that the ability of LLMs to comprehend noisy\nutterances is still relatively superficial compared to human proficiency in\nprocessing them.",

We do so on a task of opinionated journalistic text\nclassification in French. Using a fine-tuned CamemBERT model and an explanation\nmethod based on relevance propagation, we find that training with different\nrandom seeds produces models with similar accuracy but variable explanations.\nWe therefore claim that characterizing the explanations' statistical\ndistribution is needed for the explainability of LLMs. We then explore a\nsimpler model based on textual features which offers stable explanations but is\nless accurate. Hence, this simpler model corresponds to a different tradeoff\nbetween accuracy and explainability. We show that it can be improved by\ninserting features derived from CamemBERT's explanations.

Systems\ncomposed of B-type and O-type stars are of particular interest due to their\npotential to lead to very energetic phenomena or the merging of exotic compact\nobjects. We aim to determine the orbital period variations of a sample of B+B\nand O+B massive overcontact binaries, with the primary objectives of\ncharacterizing the evolutionary timescales of these systems and addressing the\nexisting discrepancy between observational data and theoretical predictions\nderived from population synthesis models. We used Period04 to analyze archival\nphotometric data going back a century for a sample of seven binary systems to\nmeasure their orbital periods. We then determine the period variations using a\nlinear fit. We find that the period variation timescales of five truly\novercontact binary systems align with the nuclear timescale, in agreement with\nprevious findings for more massive overcontact binaries. Additionally, we\nnoticed a clear distinction between the five systems that had been\nunambiguously classified as overcontact systems and both SV Cen and VFTS 066,\nwhich seem to be evolving on thermal timescales and might be misclassified as\novercontact systems. In the case of the five overcontact binaries, our results\nindicate a noticeable mismatch between the observational data and the\ntheoretical predictions derived from population synthesis models.

In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on\nindividual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on\nend-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new\nbenchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery.\nTo ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our\nbenchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four\ndisciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify\nthe target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and\nemploy an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs,\nexecution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual\nvalidation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation\nquality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies\nto mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate\nfive open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct\nprompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each\ntask, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently\nand 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI\no1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the\nperformance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing\ninference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs.\nStill, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in\ngenerating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for\nscientific research.",

However, these systems exhibit\nsuboptimal performance and efficiency in cluttered environments with severe\nocclusions (e.g., dense forests or tall walls), due to limitations arising from\nperception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high\ncomputational overhead. In this paper, we present HE-Nav, the first\nhigh-performance and efficient navigation system tailored for AGRs operating in\ncluttered environments. The perception module utilizes a lightweight semantic\nscene completion network (LBSCNet), guided by a bird's eye view (BEV) feature\nfusion and enhanced by an exquisitely designed SCB-Fusion module and attention\nmechanism. This enables real-time and efficient obstacle prediction in\ncluttered areas, generating a complete local map. Building upon this completed\nmap, our novel AG-Planner employs the energy-efficient kinodynamic A* search\nalgorithm to guarantee planning is energy-saving. Subsequent trajectory\noptimization processes yield safe, smooth, dynamically feasible and ESDF-free\naerial-ground hybrid paths.

    "abstract": "Dynamic models hold great potential for research and development in signal\nprocessing, machine learning, and digital twin algorithms for diagnosing\nrotating machinery. Various studies have suggested dynamic models of gears,\nemploying many model approaches. However, there is currently a lack of a\ncomputationally efficient and publicly accessible model that accurately\nrepresents real-world data. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid model that\nintegrates a realistic and efficiently validated dynamic model of spur gear\nvibrations with an enhancement process aimed at bridging the gap between\nsimulation and reality. This process minimizes discrepancies between features\nextracted from simulated and measured data through fine-tuning of the model\nhyperparameters. The effectiveness of this hybrid model is demonstrated across\nnumerous test apparatuses, encompassing several types of faults, severities,\nand speeds. The new hybrid model, inclusive of an upgraded dynamic model,\ngenerates data swiftly within seconds and is made publicly available with a\nuser-friendly application programming interface and a detailed user manual. The\nnovel suggested hybrid model has great potential to enhance future research in\nmodel-based studies, including machine learning, signal processing, and digital\ntwin approaches.\n  The user manual can be found in the following link:\nhttps://github.com/PHM-BGU/public_dynamic_model_for_gear_vibrations",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are widely used to approximate unknown functions in control.\nA common neural network architecture uses a single hidden layer (i.e. a shallow\nnetwork), in which the input parameters are fixed in advance and only the\noutput parameters are trained. The typical formal analysis asserts that if\noutput parameters exist to approximate the unknown function with sufficient\naccuracy, then desired control performance can be achieved. A long-standing\ntheoretical gap was that no conditions existed to guarantee that, for the fixed\ninput parameters, required accuracy could be obtained by training the output\nparameters. Our recent work has partially closed this gap by demonstrating that\nif input parameters are chosen randomly, then for any sufficiently smooth\nfunction, with high-probability there are output parameters resulting in\n$O((1/m)^{1/2})$ approximation errors, where $m$ is the number of neurons.\nHowever, some applications, notably continuous-time value function\napproximation, require that the network approximates the both the unknown\nfunction and its gradient with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that\nrandomly generated input parameters and trained output parameters result in\ngradient errors of $O((\\log(m)/m)^{1/2})$, and additionally, improve the\nconstants from our prior work. We show how to apply the result to policy\nevaluation problems.",

    "abstract": "The study of survival data often requires taking proper care of the censoring\nmechanism that prohibits complete observation of the data. Under right\ncensoring, only the first occurring event is observed: either the event of\ninterest, or a competing event like withdrawal of a subject from the study. The\ncorresponding identifiability difficulties led many authors to imposing\n(conditional) independence or a fully known dependence between survival and\ncensoring times, both of which are not always realistic. However, recent\nresults in survival literature showed that parametric copula models allow\nidentification of all model parameters, including the association parameter,\nunder appropriately chosen marginal distributions. The present paper is the\nfirst one to apply such models in a quantile regression context, hence\nbenefiting from its well-known advantages in terms of e.g. robustness and\nricher inference results. The parametric copula is supplemented with a likewise\nparametric, yet flexible, enriched asymmetric Laplace distribution for the\nsurvival times conditional on the covariates. Its asymmetric Laplace basis\nprovides its close connection to quantiles, while the extension with Laguerre\northogonal polynomials ensures sufficient flexibility for increasing polynomial\ndegrees. The distributional flavour of the quantile regression presented, comes\nwith advantages of both theoretical and computational nature. All model\nparameters are proven to be identifiable, consistent, and asymptotically\nnormal. Finally, performance of the model and of the proposed estimation\nprocedure is assessed through extensive simulation studies as well as an\napplication on liver transplant data.",

As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from\nsolar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as\nthe solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a\ndistribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of\nfour days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s\nfor the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak\nvelocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of\nour model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in\nan RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study\nshows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind\nvariation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning\nalgorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks\nand MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss\nfunction, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak\nvelocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a\ndistribution transformation can resolve this issue.",

This raises the\nquestion of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a\nsuperconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into\na indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the\nassociated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by\nexploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model.

    "abstract": "In this work we study the Kondo impurity problem - at a finite concentration\nof impurities. We identify two parameter regimes for the Kondo impurity\nproblem. 1) The single impurity limit, where the concentration of Kondo\nimpurities is so low that the background scattering mechanisms (non-magnetic\nimpurities, Umklapp scattering, etc.) of the metal considered are the dominant\nconduction electron scattering mechanisms at zero temperature. 2) The dilute\nimpurity system limit where the concentration of magnetic impurities is such\nthat they form the dominant mechanism of conduction electron scattering at zero\ntemperature of the metal in question (this is accompanied by a variety of\neasily detectable Kondo signatures (resistance minimum, specific heat\nmeasurements, magnetization as a function of external magnetic field,\nconduction electron dephasing rates as well as ARPES, RIXS and NMR\nspectroscopies)) while still being very dilute. Most theoretical efforts are\ncurrently in regime where a single isolated impurity is considered - regime 1)\nwhile most experimental efforts are in regime 2). We present analytical\nevidence that this explains the well known discrepancy between experiment and\ntheory as to the value of the Kondo temperature. We find that the ratio between\nthe two Kondo temperatures in regime 1) and regime 2) is given by:\n$\\mathcal{R}=\\exp\\left[\\frac{\\pi^{2}\\rho v_{F}}{2k_{F}^{2}Vol}\\right]$ where\n$\\rho$ is the density of states, $v_{F}$ is the fermi velocity, and $k_{F}$ is\nthe Fermi wavevector and $Vol$ is the volume of a unit cell. We note that there\nis no dependence on the impurity concentration in this ratio so it is possible\nto define a single Kondo temperature for limit 2) for the dilute Kondo impurity\nsystem. In this work we present results within the Reed-Newns Kondo meanfield\napproximation and to leading order of the linked cluster expansion.",

Image-to-image\ntranslation can mitigate this effect, where contrastive approaches enable\nlearning of the image-to-image mapping under unsupervised regimes. However,\nexisting methods often fail to handle content-rich scenes with multiple object\ninstances, which manifests in unsatisfactory detection performance. Sensitivity\nto such instance-level content is typically only gained through object\nannotations, which can be expensive to obtain. Towards addressing this issue,\nwe present a novel image-to-image translation method that specifically targets\ncross-domain object detection.

Instead of relying on object annotations to\nexplicitly account for object instances during translation, our approach learns\nto represent objects by contrasting local-global information. This affords\ninvestigation of an under-explored challenge: obtaining performant detection,\nunder domain shifts, without relying on object annotations nor detector model\nfine-tuning.

In\nthis study, we adopt a dual approach to investigate water confined within\ninfinite graphene slits. Our Molecular Dynamics simulations reveal hysteresis\nacross all investigated temperatures. Unlike in finite slits, where hysteresis\narises due to surface tension effects at the edges, in the case of infinite\nslits, the hysteresis is the result of a genuine phase transition at the\nnanoscale. We analyze the spatial and orientational arrangements of the water\nmolecules, demonstrating how the graphene surface promotes the formation of a\nhydrogen bond network in the adjacent water layers. The remarkably low pressure\nrequired for water uptake in this nano-environment is explained at the\nmean-field level using a simple interacting lattice model. This is attributed\nto the exponential dependence of the critical pressure on the\nadsorbate-adsorbent interaction.",

However, to meet these requirements\nin the Transformer model, the norm of the model parameters must be non-uniform,\nand thus, parameters whose norm is smaller are more sensitive to the parameter\nupdate. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique, weight scaling as\nreparameterization (WeSaR). WeSaR introduces a gate parameter per parameter\nmatrix and adjusts it to the value satisfying the requirements.

Moreover, we include additional\nattack formats in addition to the one originally studied.",

Advances in\nphotorealistic environment models have enabled robots to develop\nhyper-realistic reconstructions, which can be used to generate images that are\nintuitive for human inspection. In particular, the recently introduced\n\\ac{3DGS}, which describes the scene with up to millions of primitive\nellipsoids, can be rendered in real time. \\ac{3DGS} has rapidly gained\nprominence. However, a critical unsolved problem persists: how can we fuse\nmultiple \\ac{3DGS} into a single coherent model? Solving this problem will\nenable robot teams to jointly build \\ac{3DGS} models of their surroundings. A\nkey insight of this work is to leverage the {duality} between photorealistic\nreconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and\n\\emph{3D foundation models}, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To\nthis end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic\n\\ac{3DGS} models with 3D foundation models. As \\ac{3DGS} models are generally\nbuilt from monocular camera images, they have \\emph{arbitrary scale}. To\nresolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different\n\\ac{3DGS} models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the\nalignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to\nproduce high-quality fused \\ac{3DGS} models.

    "abstract": "The widely established techniques for the generation of ultrashort optical\npulses rely on passive mode-locking of lasers, with the output pulse duration\nand emission spectrum determined by the intrinsic lifetime of laser transition\nin the gain medium. Due to the instantaneous nature of nonlinear gain, optical\nparametric oscillators (OPOs) are capable of generating optical radiation in\nall time scales from continuous-wave (cw) to ultrashort femtosecond regime, if\ndriven by laser pump sources in the corresponding time domain. In the\nultrashort time scale, operation of OPOs conventionally relies on mode-locked\npump lasers, with the concomitant disadvantages of large footprint and high\ncost. At the same time, the lack of gain storage mandates the use of\nsynchronous pumping, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we\npresent the concept of phase-modulated OPO driven by cw pump laser. The\napproach overcomes the traditional drawbacks of ultrafast OPOs, enabling\nfemtosecond pulse generation without the need for synchronous pumping,\nresulting in a simplified, compact and cost-effective architecture using cw\ninput pump lasers. We derive a mean-field equation for a degenerate\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ OPO driven by a cw laser with intracavity electro-optic modulator\n(EOM), and also including dispersion compensation. The new equation predicts\nthe formation of stable femtosecond pulses ($<$200~fs), in both normal and\nanomalous dispersion regimes, with a controllable repetition rate determined by\nthe frequency of the EOM.

First, we prove local well-posedness in\nthe energy space $H^1\\times L^2$ up to the maximal existence time and a blow-up\nalternative. Second, we prove that for large data solutions exist globally as\nlong as energy and wave mass are below the ground state threshold. Third, we\nprove a regularization by noise phenomenon: the probability of global existence\nand scattering goes to one if the strength of the (non-conservative) noise goes\nto infinity. The proof is based on the refined rescaling approach and a new\nfunctional framework, where both Fourier restriction and local smoothing norms\nare used as well as a (uniform) double endpoint Strichartz and local smoothing\ninequality for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with certain rough and time dependent\nlower order perturbations.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy\nmechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either\nobservable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used,\nincluding bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy\nconstraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that\nis correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information\nto a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence,\na privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the\nrevealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy\nconstraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the\nprivate data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong\nFunctional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for\ndesigning low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal\nprivacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another\nprivacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more\nprivate than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including\nsemantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where\nthe approach can be applied.",

    "abstract": "The evolving field of mobile robotics has indeed increased the demand for\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To augment the\nlocalization accuracy and mapping efficacy of SLAM, we refined the core module\nof the SLAM system. Within the feature matching phase, we introduced\ncross-validation matching to filter out mismatches. In the keyframe selection\nstrategy, an exponential threshold function is constructed to quantify the\nkeyframe selection process. Compared with a single robot, the multi-robot\ncollaborative SLAM (CSLAM) system substantially improves task execution\nefficiency and robustness. By employing a centralized structure, we formulate a\nmulti-robot SLAM system and design a coarse-to-fine matching approach for\nmulti-map point cloud registration. Our system, built upon ORB-SLAM3, underwent\nextensive evaluation utilizing the TUM RGB-D, EuRoC MAV, and TUM_VI datasets.\nThe experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the\npositioning accuracy and mapping quality of our enhanced algorithm compared to\nthose of ORB-SLAM3, with a 12.90% reduction in the absolute trajectory error.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervision is often used for pre-training to foster performance on a\ndownstream task by constructing meaningful representations of samples.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) generally involves generating different views of\nthe same sample and thus requires data augmentations that are challenging to\nconstruct for tabular data. This constitutes one of the main challenges of\nself-supervision for structured data. In the present work, we propose a novel\naugmentation-free SSL method for tabular data. Our approach, T-JEPA, relies on\na Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and is akin to mask\nreconstruction in the latent space. It involves predicting the latent\nrepresentation of one subset of features from the latent representation of a\ndifferent subset within the same sample, thereby learning rich representations\nwithout augmentations. We use our method as a pre-training technique and train\nseveral deep classifiers on the obtained representation. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate a substantial improvement in both classification and\nregression tasks, outperforming models trained directly on samples in their\noriginal data space. Moreover, T-JEPA enables some methods to consistently\noutperform or match the performance of traditional methods likes Gradient\nBoosted Decision Trees. To understand why, we extensively characterize the\nobtained representations and show that T-JEPA effectively identifies relevant\nfeatures for downstream tasks without access to the labels. Additionally, we\nintroduce regularization tokens, a novel regularization method critical for\ntraining of JEPA-based models on structured data.",

    "abstract": "Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is an emerging technology\nfor 6G communications, in which numerous antenna units are integrated in a\nlimited space. As the HMIMO array aperture expands, the near-field region of\nthe array is dramatically enlarged, resulting in more users being located in\nthe near-field region. This creates new opportunities for wireless\ncommunications. In this context, the evaluation of the spatial degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) of HMIMO multi-user systems in near-field channels is an open\nproblem, as the analytical methods utilized for evaluating the DoF in far-field\nchannels cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a novel method\nto calculate the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels. We first\nderive the DoF for a single user in the near field, and then extend the\nanalysis to multi-user scenarios. In this latter scenario, we focus on the\nimpact of spatial blocking between HMIMO users. The derived analytical\nframework reveals that the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels is\nnot in general given by the sum of the DoF of the HMIMO single-user setting\nbecause of spatial blocking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method. In the considered case study, the number of DoF reduces\nby $21.2\\%$ on average due to spatial blocking.",

Research debt is increasing and many papers are found\nnot to be reproducible.\n  This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study\nmachine learning categorically.

This could solve some of the aforementioned problems.\n  In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep\nlearning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model\ngradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral\ntransforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of\nfunctors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and,\nfinally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of\nneural network architectures.",

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of LLM usage today, e.g., multi-round conversation and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache)\nreusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory,\nonly a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing\ninference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by\nrecomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for\nlater retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O\noverheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key\nidea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize\ncomputational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two\ntechniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates\nresource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and\nIO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch\nissue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration).\nOur evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the\nTTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less\nstorage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X\nreduction in TTFT.",

In the initial\nprior-construction stage, we preliminarily predict a rough prior phase spectrum\nfrom the amplitude spectrum. The subsequent refinement stage transforms the\namplitude spectrum into a refined high-quality phase spectrum conditioned on\nthe prior phase. Networks in both stages use ConvNeXt v2 blocks as the backbone\nand adopt adversarial training by innovatively introducing a phase spectrum\ndiscriminator (PSD). To further improve the continuity of the refined phase, we\nalso incorporate a time-frequency integrated difference (TFID) loss in the\nrefinement stage. Experimental results confirm that, compared to neural\nnetwork-based no-prior phase prediction methods, the proposed SP-NSPP achieves\nhigher phase prediction accuracy, thanks to introducing the coarse phase priors\nand diverse training criteria. Compared to iterative phase estimation\nalgorithms, our proposed SP-NSPP does not require multiple rounds of staged\niterations, resulting in higher generation efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasing adoption of modern AI-enabled control systems, ensuring\ntheir safety and reliability has become a critical task in software testing.\nOne prevalent approach to testing control systems is falsification, which aims\nto find an input signal that causes the control system to violate a formal\nsafety specification using optimization algorithms. However, applying\nfalsification to AI-enabled control systems poses two significant challenges:\n(1)~it requires the system to execute numerous candidate test inputs, which can\nbe time-consuming, particularly for systems with AI models that have many\nparameters, and (2)~multiple safety requirements are typically defined as a\nconjunctive specification, which is difficult for existing falsification\napproaches to comprehensively cover.\n  This paper introduces Synthify, a falsification framework tailored for\nAI-enabled control systems. Our approach performs falsification in a two-phase\nprocess. At the start, Synthify synthesizes a program that implements one or a\nfew linear controllers to serve as a proxy for the AI controller. This proxy\nprogram mimics the AI controller's functionality but is computationally more\nefficient. Then, Synthify employs the $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy to sample a\npromising sub-specification from the conjunctive safety specification. It then\nuses a Simulated Annealing-based falsification algorithm to find violations of\nthe sampled sub-specification for the control system. To evaluate Synthify, we\ncompare it to PSY-TaLiRo, a state-of-the-art and industrial-strength\nfalsification tool, on 8 publicly available control systems. On average,\nSynthify achieves a 83.5% higher success rate in falsification compared to\nPSY-TaLiRo with the same budget of falsification trials. The safety violations\nfound by Synthify are also more diverse than those found by PSY-TaLiRo,\ncovering 137.7% more sub-specifications.",

However, these models often fail to capture the anomalies observed\nin intertemporal choices and decision-making under uncertainty, particularly\nwhen accounting for individual differences in preferences and consumption\npatterns. Such limitations hinder traditional finance theory's ability to\naddress key questions like: How do personal preferences shape investment\nchoices? What drives investor behaviour? And how do individuals select their\nportfolios? One prominent contribution is Pompian's model of four Behavioral\nInvestor Types (BITs), which links behavioural finance studies with Keirsey's\ntemperament theory, highlighting the role of personality in financial\ndecision-making. Yet, traditional parametric models struggle to capture how\nthese distinct temperaments influence intertemporal decisions, such as how\nindividuals evaluate trade-offs between present and future outcomes. To address\nthis gap, the present study employs Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to\nspecifically investigate temporal discounting behaviours revealing nuanced\npatterns in how different temperaments perceive and manage uncertainty over\ntime. Our findings show heterogeneity within each temperament, suggesting that\ninvestor profiles are far more diverse than previously thought.

    "abstract": "Electron density is a fundamental quantity, which can in principle determine\nall ground state electronic properties of a given system. Although machine\nlearning (ML) models for electron density based on either an atom-centered\nbasis or a real-space grid have been proposed, the demand for the number of\nhigh-order basis functions or grid points is enormous. In this work, we propose\nan efficient grid-point sampling strategy that combines a targeted sampling\nfavoring large density and a screening of grid points associated with linearly\nindependent atomic features. This new sampling strategy is integrated with a\nfield-induced recursively embedded atom neural network model to develop a\nreal-space grid-based ML model for electron density and its response to an\nelectric field. This approach is applied to a QM9 molecular dataset, a\nH2O/Pt(111) interfacial system, and an Au(100) electrode under an electric\nfield. The number of training points is found much smaller than previous\nmodels, when yielding comparably accurate predictions for the electron density\nof the entire grid. The resultant machine learned electron density model\nenables us to properly partition partial charge onto each atom and analyze the\ncharge variation upon proton transfer in the H2O/Pt(111) system. The machined\nlearned electronic response model allows us to predict charge transfer and the\nelectrostatic potential change induced by an electric field in an Au(100)\nelectrode.",

Distinct from\ntraditional methods such as power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access\n(PD-NOMA) that heavily relies on successive interference cancellation (SIC),\nND-NOMA utilizes the noise domain, considerably reducing power consumption and\nsystem complexity. Inspired by noise modulation, ND-NOMA enhances energy\nefficiency and provides lower bit error probability (BEP), making it highly\nsuitable for next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Our theoretical\nanalyses and computer simulations reveal that ND-NOMA can achieve exceptionally\nlow bit error rates in both uplink and downlink scenarios, in the presence of\nRician fading channels. The proposed multi-user system is supported by a\nminimum distance detector for mean detection and a threshold-based detector for\nvariance detection, ensuring robust communication in low-power environments. By\nleveraging the inherent properties of noise, ND-NOMA offers a promising\nplatform for long-term deployments of low-cost and low-complexity devices.",

However,\nachieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains\nchallenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent\neffects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D\nspatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects,\nbut the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this\npaper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS),\nwhich enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional\ndirectional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our\napproach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves\nreal-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects\nand fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms\n3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction\nof 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

In this paper, first we\nintroduce the notion of post-groupoids, which consists of a group bundle and\nsome other structures satisfying some compatibility conditions. Post-groupoids\nreduce to post-groups if the underlying base is one point. An action of a group\non a set gives rise to the natural example of post-groupoids. We show that a\npost-groupoid gives rise to a groupoid (called the Grossman-Larson groupoid),\nand an action on the original group bundle. Then we introduce the notion of\nrelative Rota-Baxter operators on a groupoid with respect to an action on a\ngroup bundle. A relative Rota-Baxter operator naturally gives rise to a\npost-groupoid and a matched pair of groupoids. One important application of\npost-groupoids is that they give rise to quiver-theoretical solutions of the\nYang-Baxter equation on the quiver underlying the Grossman-Larson groupoid. We\nalso introduce the notion of a skew-left bracoid, which consists of a group\nbundle and a groupoid satisfying some compatibility conditions. A skew-left\nbracoid reduces to a skew-left brace if the underlying base is one point. We\ngive the one-to-one correspondence between post-groupoids and skew-left\nbracoids.

In successful tacking\nthe sail flips to the mirror-image shape, while in unsuccessful tacking the\nsail remains stuck in a metastable state close to the initial shape. We\ninvestigate whether the sail flips, and if so, how long it takes and the\nsubsequent dynamics, over a parameter space that describes the sail membrane\nproperties and the kinematics of tacking. We find that the \"steady\" parameters\n-- stretching rigidity, pretension, and final angle of attack -- mostly\ndetermine whether a membrane flips or not. Flipping is more likely with larger\nvalues of the stretching rigidity, pretension, and final angle of attack. The\ndynamical parameters -- membrane mass density, concavity of angle-of-attack\ntransition kinematics, and time-length of the tacking maneuver -- mainly affect\nhow long flipping takes. With large membrane mass the membrane can maintain the\nmomentum from the tacking motion long enough to reach the flipped state, but it\nmay also take longer to converge to a steady shape. Concave-down\nangle-of-attack profiles and small tack times are generally associated with\nshorter flip times but a few exceptions exist, because these kinematics can\nalso give a larger acceleration to the fluid-sail system that persists for\nlonger times.

We argue that\nsuccessfully intervening on a model is a prerequisite for interpreting its\ninternal workings. Concretely, we establish a three-term objective: a\nsuccessful intervention should flip the correct with the wrong token and vice\nversa (effectiveness), and leave other tokens unaffected (faithfulness), all\nwhile being sparse (minimality). Using gradient-based optimization, this\nobjective lets us learn (and later evaluate) a specific kind of efficient and\ninterpretable intervention: activation scaling only modifies the signed\nmagnitude of activation vectors to strengthen, weaken, or reverse the steering\ndirections already encoded in the model. On synthetic tasks, this intervention\nperforms comparably with steering vectors in terms of effectiveness and\nfaithfulness, but is much more minimal allowing us to pinpoint interpretable\nmodel components. We evaluate activation scaling from different angles, compare\nperformance on different datasets, and make activation scalars a learnable\nfunction of the activation vectors themselves to generalize to varying-length\nprompts.",

Our main finding is that active galactic nuclei (AGN's) that host\ninspiraling binaries can exhibit two sub-types of long-term secular variability\npatterns: Type-A events which dim before merger and brighten afterward, and\nType-B events which brighten before merger and dim afterward. In both types the\nmerger coincides with a long-lasting chromatic change of the AGN appearance.\nThe sub-types correspond to the direction of angular momentum transfer between\nthe binary and the disk, and could thus have correlated GW signatures if the\ngas-induced torque can be inferred from GW phase drift measurements by LISA.\nThe long-term brightness trends are caused by steady weakening of the\ndisk-binary torque that accompanies orbital decay, it induces a hysteresis\neffect whereby the disk \"remembers\" the history of the binary's contraction. We\nillustrate the effect using a reduced model problem of an axisymmetric thin\ndisk subjected at its inner edge to the weakening torque of an inspiraling\nbinary. The model problem yields a new class of self-similar disk solutions,\nwhich capture salient features of the multi-dimensional hydrodynamics\nsimulations. We use these solutions to derive variable AGN disk emission\nsignatures within years to decades of massive black hole binary mergers in\nAGN's.

VLN-CM is composed of\nfour modules and predicts the direction and distance of the next movement at\neach step. We utilize large foundation models for each modules. To select the\ndirection, we use the Attention Spot Predictor (ASP), View Selector (VS), and\nProgress Monitor (PM). The ASP employs a Large Language Model (e.g. ChatGPT) to\nsplit navigation instructions into attention spots, which are objects or scenes\nat the location to move to (e.g. a yellow door). The VS selects from panorama\nimages provided at 30-degree intervals the one that includes the attention\nspot, using CLIP similarity. We then choose the angle of the selected image as\nthe direction to move in. The PM uses a rule-based approach to decide which\nattention spot to focus on next, among multiple spots derived from the\ninstructions. If the similarity between the current attention spot and the\nvisual observations decreases consecutively at each step, the PM determines\nthat the agent has passed the current spot and moves on to the next one. For\nselecting the distance to move, we employed the Open Map Predictor (OMP). The\nOMP uses panorama depth information to predict an occupancy mask. We then\nselected a collision-free distance in the predicted direction based on the\noccupancy mask. We evaluated our method using the validation data of VLN-CE.\nOur approach showed better performance than several baseline methods, and the\nOPM was effective in mitigating collisions for the agent.",

For the Cauchy problem of said model we provide a full well-posedness\ntheory on $\\R^2$ for $L^1\\cap L^\\infty \\cap H^1$ initial conditions.

To prove uniqueness, we use classical $L^2$-stability\nwhich relies on the $H^1$-regularity of the solution. In the second part of the\npaper we provide a brief, general discussion on the steady states for these\ntype of models, and display a specific example of non-trivial steady states for\nan SIS model with aggregations (driven by a single repulsive-attractive\npotential), the existence of which is determined by a threshold condition for a\nsuitable \"space-dependent\" basic reproduction rate.

The use of optical camera\nsystems can allow real-time usage of maritime footage. This thesis presents an\ninvestigation into leveraging deep learning and computer vision to advance\nreal-time ship recognition and georeferencing for the improvement of maritime\nsituational awareness. A novel dataset, ShipSG, is introduced, containing 3,505\nimages and 11,625 ship masks with corresponding class and geographic position.\nAfter an exploration of state-of-the-art, a custom real-time segmentation\narchitecture, ScatYOLOv8+CBAM, is designed for the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier\nembedded system. This architecture adds the 2D scattering transform and\nattention mechanisms to YOLOv8, achieving an mAP of 75.46% and an 25.3 ms per\nframe, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by over 5%. To improve small and\ndistant ship recognition in high-resolution images on embedded systems, an\nenhanced slicing mechanism is introduced, improving mAP by 8% to 11%.\nAdditionally, a georeferencing method is proposed, achieving positioning errors\nof 18 m for ships up to 400 m away and 44 m for ships between 400 m and 1200 m.\nThe findings are also applied in real-world scenarios, such as the detection of\nabnormal ship behaviour, camera integrity assessment and 3D reconstruction. The\napproach of this thesis outperforms existing methods and provides a framework\nfor integrating recognized and georeferenced ships into real-time systems,\nenhancing operational effectiveness and decision-making for maritime\nstakeholders.

It reduces\nlaser absorption, it modifies atomic physics due to its influence on the free\nelectron population, it alters conduction and any other quantities that depends\nupon electron velocity distribution (EVD). Here, the Langdon effect has been\nstudied with CMDS using the code LAMMPS where, contrary to Fokker-Plank\nsimulations, widely used in the past, plasma many-body behavior at the\nmicroscopic level is taken into account self-consistently.

All simulations\nproduce successful explosions with final energies ranging from $0.41 \\times\n10^{51}$ erg to $2.5 \\times 10^{51}$ erg and black hole masses from $20.7\nM_\\odot$ to $34.4 M_\\odot$. Explosion energies and remnant masses do not vary\nmonotonically with progenitor mass, but the mass cuts cluster near the outer\nedge of the helium core. A supplementary model with decreased neutrino heating\nprovides a tentative indication that successful explosions require the shock to\nreach the sonic point in the infall profile by the time of black hole\nformation. The propagation of the shock to the surface is only approximately\ncaptured by proposed shock invariants, but these may still be sufficient to\nextrapolate the final black hole mass from the first seconds of evolution. We\nalso discuss potential multi-messenger signatures of the predicted fallback\nexplosions.

    "abstract": "We present OmniBooth, an image generation framework that enables spatial\ncontrol with instance-level multi-modal customization. For all instances, the\nmultimodal instruction can be described through text prompts or image\nreferences. Given a set of user-defined masks and associated text or image\nguidance, our objective is to generate an image, where multiple objects are\npositioned at specified coordinates and their attributes are precisely aligned\nwith the corresponding guidance. This approach significantly expands the scope\nof text-to-image generation, and elevates it to a more versatile and practical\ndimension in controllability. In this paper, our core contribution lies in the\nproposed latent control signals, a high-dimensional spatial feature that\nprovides a unified representation to integrate the spatial, textual, and image\nconditions seamlessly. The text condition extends ControlNet to provide\ninstance-level open-vocabulary generation. The image condition further enables\nfine-grained control with personalized identity. In practice, our method\nempowers users with more flexibility in controllable generation, as users can\nchoose multi-modal conditions from text or images as needed. Furthermore,\nthorough experiments demonstrate our enhanced performance in image synthesis\nfidelity and alignment across different tasks and datasets.

Additionally, the use of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA)\nat the ISAC common receiver not only facilitates terahertz-rate communication\nlinks but also significantly enhances the accuracy of target detection in radar\napplications. In practical scenarios, communication scatterers and radar\ntargets often reside in close proximity to the ISAC receiver. This, combined\nwith the use of ELAA, fundamentally alters the electromagnetic characteristics\nof wireless and radar channels, shifting from far-field planar-wave propagation\nto near-field spherical wave propagation. Under the far-field planar-wave\nmodel, the phase of the array response vector varies linearly with the antenna\nindex. In contrast, in the near-field spherical wave model, this phase\nrelationship becomes nonlinear. This shift presents a fundamental challenge:\nthe widely-used Fourier analysis can no longer be directly applied for target\ndetection and communication channel estimation at the ISAC common receiver. In\nthis work, we propose a feasible solution to address this fundamental issue.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that there exists a high-dimensional space in\nwhich the phase nonlinearity can be expressed as linear. Leveraging this\ninsight, we develop a lifted super-resolution framework that simultaneously\nperforms communication channel estimation and extracts target parameters with\nhigh precision.",

    "abstract": "Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) has gained growing attention\ndue to its ability to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, the performance of\nFedSeqRec is still unsatisfactory because the models used in FedSeqRec have to\nbe lightweight to accommodate communication bandwidth and clients' on-device\ncomputational resource constraints. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\nexhibited strong transferable and generalized language understanding abilities\nand therefore, in the NLP area, many downstream tasks now utilize LLMs as a\nservice to achieve superior performance without constructing complex models.\nInspired by this successful practice, we propose a generic FedSeqRec framework,\nFELLAS, which aims to enhance FedSeqRec by utilizing LLMs as an external\nservice. Specifically, FELLAS employs an LLM server to provide both item-level\nand sequence-level representation assistance. The item-level representation\nservice is queried by the central server to enrich the original ID-based item\nembedding with textual information, while the sequence-level representation\nservice is accessed by each client. However, invoking the sequence-level\nrepresentation service requires clients to send sequences to the external LLM\nserver. To safeguard privacy, we implement dx-privacy satisfied sequence\nperturbation, which protects clients' sensitive data with guarantees.\nAdditionally, a contrastive learning-based method is designed to transfer\nknowledge from the noisy sequence representation to clients' sequential\nrecommendation models. Furthermore, to empirically validate the privacy\nprotection capability of FELLAS, we propose two interacted item inference\nattacks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets with two widely used\nsequential recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and\nprivacy-preserving capability of FELLAS.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) now\npresent a possible tool to tackle this problem, as they can generalize across\ntheir large corpus of training data and perform zero-shot reasoning on new\nevents, allowing them to detect possible portfolio crash events without\nrequiring specific training data. However, detecting portfolio crashes is a\ncomplex problem that requires more than basic reasoning abilities.

We aggregate the selected projections by taking the\nsingular value decomposition of their empirical average and then output the\nleading order singular vectors.

The general\nflexibility-based formulation exploits the kinematic equations combined with\nthe inverted sectional equations and the integrated form of equilibrium\nequations. The resulting set of three first-order differential equations is\ndiscretized by finite differences and the boundary value problem is converted\ninto an initial value problem using the shooting method. Due to the special\nstructure of the governing equations, the scheme remains explicit even though\nthe first derivatives are approximated by central differences, leading to high\naccuracy. The main advantage of the adopted approach is that the error can be\nefficiently reduced by refining the computational grid used for finite\ndifferences at the element level while keeping the number of global degrees of\nfreedom low. The efficiency is also increased by dealing directly with the\nglobal centerline coordinates and sectional inclination with respect to global\naxes as the primary unknowns at the element level, thereby avoiding\ntransformations between local and global coordinates. Two formulations of the\nsectional equations, referred to as the Reissner and Ziegler models, are\npresented and compared. In particular, stability of an axially loaded\nbeam/column is investigated and the connections to the Haringx and Engesser\nstability theories are discussed. Both approaches are tested in a series of\nnumerical examples, which illustrate (i) high accuracy with quadratic\nconvergence when the spatial discretization is refined, (ii) easy modeling of\nvariable stiffness along the element (such as rigid joint offsets), (iii)\nefficient and accurate characterization of the buckling and post-buckling\nbehavior.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-Keplerian flow, a special regime of Taylor-Couette co-rotating flow, is\nof great astrophysical interest for studying angular momentum transport in\naccretion disks. The well-known magnetorotational instability (MRI)\nsuccessfully explains the flow instability and generation of turbulence in\ncertain accretion disks, but fails to account for these phenomena in\nprotoplanetary disks where magnetic effects are negligible. Given the intrinsic\ndecrease of the temperature in these disks, we examine the effect of radial\nthermal stratification on 3-D global disturbances in linearised quasi-Keplerian\nflows under radial gravitational acceleration mimicking stellar gravity. Our\nresults show a thermohydrodynamic linear instability for both axisymmetric and\nnon-axisymmetric modes across a broad parameter space of the\nthermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flow. Generally, decreasing Richardson or\nPrandtl numbers stabilises the flow, while a reduced radius ratio destabilises\nit. This work also provides a quantitative characterisation of the instability.\nAt low Prandtl numbers $Pr$, we observe a scaling relation of the linear\ncritical Taylor number $Ta_c\\propto$$Pr^{-6/5}$. Extrapolating the observed\nscaling to high $Ta$ and low $Pr$ may suggest the relevance of the instability\nto accretion disks. Moreover, even slight thermal stratification, characterised\nby a low Richardson number, can trigger the flow instability with a small axial\nwavelength. These findings are qualitatively consistent with the results from a\ntraditional local stability analysis based on short wave approximations. Our\nstudy refines the thermally-induced linearly-unstable transition route in\nprotoplanetary disks to explain angular momentum transport in dead zones where\nMRI is ineffective.",

Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the\nDavies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization\nprocess in nature.\n  Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler\nfor various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense\nthat one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH $H$ on a quantum\ncomputer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the\ncorresponding classical Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$. We demonstrate that our Gibbs\nsampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results as well as prepare the\nGibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low\ntemperature region, as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the\ncorresponding classical Hamiltonians. Our reductions are as follows.\n  - If $H$ is a 2-local qudit CLH, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical\nHamiltonian.\n  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical\nqubits, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar\ngraph.

The model\ncouples mass balances and kinetic equations for all components. Both single and\nmultiple-component cases are considered with constant or variable velocity.\nNon-dimensionalisation indicates the small effect of diffusion. The system\nwhere diffusion is neglected is analysed using Laplace transforms. In the\nmultiple-component case, it is demonstrated that the competition between the\ncompounds is negligible and the equations may be decoupled. This reduces the\nproblem to solving a single integral equation to determine the concentration\nprofile for all components (since they are scaled versions of each other). For\na given analyte, we then only two parameters need to be fitted to the data. To\nverify this approach, the full governing equations are also solved numerically\nusing the finite difference method and a global adaptive quadrature method to\nintegrate the Laplace transformation. Comparison with the Laplace solution\nverifies the high degree of accuracy of the simpler Laplace form. The Laplace\nsolution is then verified against experimental data from BTEX chromatography.\nThis novel method, which involves solving a single equation and fitting\nparameters in pairs for individual components, is highly efficient. It is\nsignificantly faster and simpler than the full numerical solution and avoids\nthe computationally expensive methods that would normally be used to fit all\ncurves at the same time.",

This maximization problem\nis called a peaks computation problem. The problem is to find a couple composed\nof an initial state and a time which maximizes a given function over states.\nThe paper focuses on the time component of the optimal solution which is an\ninteger as the time is discrete. We develop a method to provide an upper bound\nof this integer from a formula which requires a pair of a strictly increasing\nand continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). A first result proves\nthat the formula provides, in theory, the optimal integer. However, in\npractice, the computation cannot be so precise. Then, we develop two\nalternative methods. The first is based on discontinuous and non strictly\nincreasing/decreasing $\\mathcal{KL}$-like functions named $\\klgen$ functions.\nWe prove that the existence of a $mathcal{KL}_{\\rm gen}$ upper bound is\nequivalent to the existence of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous\nfunction on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of the strictly\nincreasing continuous function from a $mathcal{KL}_{\\rm gen}$ function needs an\nextension of the famous Sontag's lemma. Finally, we construct a new type of\nLyapunov functions, called Opt-Lyapunov functions, well designed for our peaks\ncomputation problem. Opt-Lyapunov functions are well designed as we establish\nan equivalence theorem between the existence of an Opt-Lyapunov function and of\na pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on $[0,1]$ and a scalar\nin (0,1).

It has been\nconfirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves\nfluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density.\nMotivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections\nfrom the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of\nmatter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP\nmodels: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and\nSpindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis,\nwe have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory:\na linear $f(T,\\mathcal{T})=\\alpha T+\\beta\\mathcal{T}$ and a quadratic model\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})=\\eta T^2+\\chi\\mathcal{T}$. The shape function solutions\ncorresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in\nspacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the\nincreasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical\nobjects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole\nsolutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field\nbackgrounds. We employ the $3^{rd}$ order WKB expansion to find the complex\nfrequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation.\nAdditionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy\nfor the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining\nthese wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical\nstability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.",

Until now, the higher-order\nStokes phenomenon has also been treated as a discontinuous event. In this paper\nwe show how the higher-order Stokes phenomenon is, in fact, also smooth and\noccurs universally with a prefactor that takes the form of a new special\nfunction, based on a Gaussian convolution of an error function that gives rise\nto a rich structure. We provide a rigorous derivation of the result, with\nexamples spanning the gamma function, a second-order nonlinear ODE and the\ntelegraph equation, giving rise to a ghost-like smooth contribution that is\npresent in the vicinity of a Stokes line, but which rapidly tends to zero on\neither side. We also include a rigorous derivation and example of the effect of\nthe smoothed higher-order Stokes phenomenon on the individual terms in the\nasymptotic series, where the additional contributions appear prefactored by an\nerror function.",

However,\napplying these techniques across consecutive tasks in order to include, e.g.,\nnew objects or styles, leads to a forgetting of previous knowledge due to\nmutual interference between their adapters. In this work, we tackle the problem\nof continual customization under a rigorous regime with no access to past\ntasks' adapters. In such a scenario, we investigate how different adapters'\ninitialization and merging methods can improve the quality of the final model.\nTo that end, we evaluate the naive continual fine-tuning of customized models\nand compare this approach with three methods for consecutive adapters'\ntraining: sequentially merging new adapters, merging orthogonally initialized\nadapters, and updating only relevant task-specific weights. In our experiments,\nwe show that the proposed techniques mitigate forgetting when compared to the\nnaive approach. In our studies, we show different traits of selected techniques\nand their effect on the plasticity and stability of the continually adapted\nmodel.

To address this challenge, we propose ResTNet, a network that\ninterleaves residual and Transformer blocks to bridge local and global\nknowledge. ResTNet improves playing strength across multiple board games,\nincreasing win rate from 54.6% to 60.8% in 9x9 Go, 53.6% to 60.9% in 19x19 Go,\nand 50.4% to 58.0% in 19x19 Hex. In addition, ResTNet effectively processes\nglobal information and tackles two long-sequence patterns in 19x19 Go,\nincluding circular pattern and ladder pattern. It reduces the mean square error\nfor circular pattern recognition from 2.58 to 1.07 and lowers the attack\nprobability against an adversary program from 70.44% to 23.91%. ResTNet also\nimproves ladder pattern recognition accuracy from 59.15% to 80.01%. By\nvisualizing attention maps, we demonstrate that ResTNet captures critical game\nconcepts in both Go and Hex, offering insights into AlphaZero's decision-making\nprocess.

Here, the features of the\npenultimate layer are free variables, which makes the model data-agnostic and,\nhence, puts into question its ability to capture DNN training. Our work\naddresses the issue, moving away from unconstrained features and studying DNNs\nthat end with at least two linear layers.

We then show\nthat such assumptions hold for gradient descent training with weight decay: (i)\nfor networks with a wide first layer, we prove low training error and\nbalancedness, and (ii) for solutions that are either nearly optimal or stable\nunder large learning rates, we additionally prove the bounded conditioning.\nTaken together, our results are the first to show neural collapse in the\nend-to-end training of DNNs.",

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel strategy that exclusively employs image patches\nfor attacks, thus preserving the integrity of the original text.

Through\nrigorous testing on designated `test' models, we demonstrated that the\nnumerical precision of derived stellar parameters (effective temperature,\nmass-loss rate, luminosity, and wind velocity) is not exceeding 0.05 dex.\nMoreover, the mean absolute deviation of the numerically derived stellar\nparameters is consistently below this threshold for objects with both weak (SMC\ngrid) and strong winds (WC and WN grids), even in the presence of Gaussian\nnoise.

This results in enhanced modulation of the\nelectronic structure, with abundant flat bands across the spectrum. Our\nfindings suggest that cova lent moire superlattices offer new platforms for\nexploring correlated quantum phenomena and moire covalent chemistry.",

Therefore, we propose TeX-NeRF, a 3D reconstruction method\nusing only infrared images, which introduces the object material emissivity as\na priori, preprocesses the infrared images using Pseudo-TeX vision, and maps\nthe temperatures (T), emissivities (e), and textures (X) of the scene into the\nsaturation (S), hue (H), and value (V) channels of the HSV color space,\nrespectively.

Fortunately, Sign Gradient\nDescent (SignGD) serves as an effective surrogate for Adam. Despite its\nsimplicity, theoretical understanding of how SignGD optimizes transformers\nstill lags behind. In this work, we study how SignGD optimizes a two-layer\ntransformer -- consisting of a softmax attention layer with trainable query-key\nparameterization followed by a linear layer -- on a linearly separable noisy\ndataset. We identify four stages in the training dynamics, each exhibiting\nintriguing behaviors.

We also show that Adam behaves similarly to SignGD in terms of both\noptimization and generalization in this setting. Additionally, we find that the\npoor generalization of SignGD is not solely due to data noise, suggesting that\nboth SignGD and Adam requires high-quality data for real-world tasks.

    "abstract": "Doppler ultrasound is widely used to monitor fetal heart rate during labor\nand pregnancy. Unfortunately, it is highly sensitive to fetal and maternal\nmovements, which can cause the displacement of the fetal heart with respect to\nthe ultrasound beam, in turn reducing the Doppler signal-to-noise ratio and\nleading to erratic, noisy, or missing heart rate readings. To tackle this\nissue, we augment the conventional Doppler ultrasound system with a rational\nagent that autonomously steers the ultrasound beam to track the position of the\nfetal heart. The proposed cognitive ultrasound system leverages a sequential\nMonte Carlo method to infer the fetal heart position from the power Doppler\nsignal, and employs a greedy information-seeking criterion to select the\nsteering angle that minimizes the positional uncertainty for future timesteps.\nThe fetal heart rate is then calculated using the Doppler signal at the\nestimated fetal heart position. Our results show that the system can accurately\ntrack the fetal heart position across challenging signal-to-noise ratio\nscenarios, mainly thanks to its dynamic transmit beam steering capability.\nAdditionally, we find that optimizing the transmit beamsteering to minimize\npositional uncertainty also optimizes downstream heart rate estimation\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Context. The new giant segmented mirror telescopes will use laser guide stars\n(LGS) for their adaptive optics (AO) systems. Two options to use as wavefront\nsensors (WFS) are the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) and the pyramid\nwavefront sensor (PWFS). Aims. In this paper, we compare the noise performance\nof the PWFS and the SHWFS. We aim to find which of the two WFS is the best to\nuse in a single or tomographic configuration. Methods. To compute the noise\nperformance we extended a noise model developed for the PWFS to be used with\nthe SHWFS. To do this, we expressed the centroiding algorithm of the SHWFS as a\nmatrix-vector multiplication, which allowed us to use the statistics of noise\nto compute its propagation through the AO loop. We validated the noise model\nwith end-to-end simulations for telescopes of 8 and 16 m in diameter. Results.\nFor an AO system with only one WFS, we found that, given the same number of\nsubapertures, the PWFS outperforms the SHWFS. For a 40 m telescope, the\nlimiting magnitude of the PWFS is around 1 magnitude higher than the SHWFS.\nWhen using multiple WFS and a Generalized least squares estimator to combine\nthe signal, our model predicts that in a tomographic system, the SHWFS performs\nbetter than the PWFS having a limiting magnitude 0.3 magnitudes higher. If\nusing sub-electron RON detectors for the PWFS, then the performances are almost\nidentical between the two WFSs Conclusions. We conclude that when using a\nsingle WFS with LGS, the PWFS is a better alternative than the SH. However, for\na tomographic system, either would have almost the same performance.",

Our approach\nis to reconsider the {\\it c\\`adl\\`ag problem} for generalized Mehler semigroups\nas a particular case of the much broader problem of constructing Hunt processes\nfrom a given Markov semigroup. Following this strategy, a consistent part of\nthis work is devoted to prove that starting from a Markov semigroup on a\ngeneral (possibly non-metrizable) state space, the existence of a suitable\nLyapunov function with relatively compact sub/sup-sets in conjunction with a\nlocal Feller-type regularity of the resolvent are sufficient to ensure the\nexistence of an associated c\\`adl\\`ag Markov process; if the topology is\nlocally generated by potentials, then the process is in fact Hunt. Other\nresults of fine potential theoretic nature are also pointed out, an important\none being the fact that the Hunt property of a process is stable under the\nchange of the topology, as long as it is locally generated by potentials. Then,\nwe derive sufficient conditions for a large class of generalized Mehler\nsemigroups in order to posses an associated Hunt process with values in the\noriginal space. To this end, we first construct explicit Lyapunov functions\nwhose sub-level sets are relatively compact with respect to the\n(non-metrizable) weak topology, and then we use the above mentioned stability\nto deduce the Hunt property with respect to the stronger norm topology.

In our previous research we\nproved that this question has an affirmative answer imposing some rather strict\nstructural assumptions: namely, neglecting the generator rotors saliency and\nassuming that the stator resistance of the synchronous generator is zero. It\nwas shown in simulations that the performance of the proposed observer was\nsensitive to these assumptions, observing a transient quality degradation for\nrealistic simulations not imposing these assumptions. Moreover, it was assumed\nin our previous work that the mechanical power and the field voltage are\navailable for measurement, a scenario that it is not always realistic. In this\npaper we accomplish two ambitious objectives. First, we propose a new observer\nthat does not impose the simplifying assumptions on the generator model.\nSecondly, we consider the more realistic scenario where only mechanical power\nis available for measurement. That is, we solve a problem of state\nreconstruction of a nonlinear system with partially known input measurements --\nthat is well-known to be a very challenging task. The design of the first\nobserver relies on two recent developments proposed by the authors, a parameter\nestimation based approach to the problem of state estimation and the use of the\nDynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) technique to estimate these\nparameters. The use of DREM allows us to overcome the problem of lack of\npersistent excitation that stymies the application of standard parameter\nestimation designs.

Additionally, at a\nfluence of $5\\times 10^{13}$ ions/cm$^2$, we observe the formation of magnetic\nbubble domains in the Bi-YIG films. Micromagnetic simulations estimate a\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction of 0.006 mJ/m$^2$, which is insufficient for\nstabilizing N\\'eel-type skyrmions. Finally, we demonstrate that the effects of\nHe$^+$ ion irradiation can be largely reversed through thermal annealing in an\noxygen atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, learned image compression (LIC) technologies have surpassed\nconventional methods notably in terms of rate-distortion (RD) performance. Most\npresent learned techniques are VAE-based with an autoregressive entropy model,\nwhich obviously promotes the RD performance by utilizing the decoded causal\ncontext. However, extant methods are highly dependent on the fixed hand-crafted\ncausal context. The question of how to guide the auto-encoder to generate a\nmore effective causal context benefit for the autoregressive entropy models is\nworth exploring. In this paper, we make the first attempt in investigating the\nway to explicitly adjust the causal context with our proposed Causal Context\nAdjustment loss (CCA-loss). By imposing the CCA-loss, we enable the neural\nnetwork to spontaneously adjust important information into the early stage of\nthe autoregressive entropy model. Furthermore, as transformer technology\ndevelops remarkably, variants of which have been adopted by many\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) LIC techniques. The existing computing devices have not\nadapted the calculation of the attention mechanism well, which leads to a\nburden on computation quantity and inference latency. To overcome it, we\nestablish a convolutional neural network (CNN) image compression model and\nadopt the unevenly channel-wise grouped strategy for high efficiency.\nUltimately, the proposed CNN-based LIC network trained with our Causal Context\nAdjustment loss attains a great trade-off between inference latency and\nrate-distortion performance.",

With the need\nfor sufficient acceleration, adequate reconstruction methods, which transfer\ndata into high quality images, are required.

In participants with irregular RR-cycles, spiral\nreal-time acquisitions showed superior image quality with respect to the\nclinical reference standard.

Extension of quantum eigenvalue and\nphase estimation algorithms to the case of non-normal input matrices is\nobstructed by several factors such as non-orthogonality of eigenvectors,\nexistence of generalized eigenvectors and the fact that eigenvalues may lie\nanywhere on the complex plane. In this work, we propose a novel approach for\nestimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices based on preparation of a\nstate that we call the \"resolvent state\". We construct the first efficient\nalgorithm for estimating the phases of the unimodular eigenvalues of a given\nnon-unitary matrix. We then construct an efficient algorithm for estimating the\nreal eigenvalues of a given non-Hermitian matrix, achieving complexities that\nmatch the best known results while operating under significantly relaxed\nassumptions on the non-real part of the spectrum. The resolvent-based approach\nthat we introduce also extends to estimating eigenvalues that lie on a\nparametrized complex curve, subject to explicitly stated conditions, thereby\npaving the way for a new paradigm of parametric eigenvalue estimation.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of renewable energy penetration in the grid, photovoltaic (PV)\npanels are connected to the grid via inverters to supply solar energy.\nTransformer-less grid-tied PV inverters are gaining popularity because of their\nimproved efficiency, reduced size, and lower costs. However, they can induce a\npath for leakage currents between the PV and the grid part due to the absence\nof galvanic isolation between them. This leads to serious electromagnetic\ninterference, loss in efficiency and safety concerns. The leakage current is\nprimarily influenced by the nature of the common mode voltage (CMV), which is\ndetermined by the switching techniques of the inverter. In this paper, a novel\ninverter topology of Hysteresis Controlled H5 with Two Clamping Diodes\n(HCH5-D2) has been derived. The HCH5-D2 topology helps to decouple the AC part\n(Grid) and DC part (PV) during the freewheeling to make the CMV constant and in\nturn, reduces the leakage current. Also, the additional diodes help to reduce\nthe voltage spikes generated during the freewheeling period and maintain the\nCMV at a constant value. Finally, a 2.2kW grid-connected single-phase HCH5-D2\nPV inverter system's MATLAB simulation has been presented with better results\nwhen compared with a traditional H4 inverter.",

    "abstract": "Classifiers trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tend to rely on\nattributes that have high spurious correlation with the target. This can\ndegrade the performance on underrepresented (or 'minority') groups that lack\nthese attributes, posing significant challenges for both out-of-distribution\ngeneralization and fairness objectives. Many studies aim to enhance robustness\nto spurious correlation, but they sometimes depend on group annotations for\ntraining. Additionally, a common limitation in previous research is the\nreliance on group-annotated validation datasets for model selection. This\nconstrains their applicability in situations where the nature of the spurious\ncorrelation is not known, or when group labels for certain spurious attributes\nare not available. To enhance model robustness with minimal group annotation\nassumptions, we propose Environment-based Validation and Loss-based Sampling\n(EVaLS). It uses the losses from an ERM-trained model to construct a balanced\ndataset of high-loss and low-loss samples, mitigating group imbalance in data.\nThis significantly enhances robustness to group shifts when equipped with a\nsimple post-training last layer retraining. By using environment inference\nmethods to create diverse environments with correlation shifts, EVaLS can\npotentially eliminate the need for group annotation in validation data. In this\ncontext, the worst environment accuracy acts as a reliable surrogate throughout\nthe retraining process for tuning hyperparameters and finding a model that\nperforms well across diverse group shifts. EVaLS effectively achieves group\nrobustness, showing that group annotation is not necessary even for validation.\nIt is a fast, straightforward, and effective approach that reaches near-optimal\nworst group accuracy without needing group annotations, marking a new chapter\nin the robustness of trained models against spurious correlation.",

Therefore, addressing\nthe AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential.\nThe AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must\nbe solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of\npower systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its\nlinearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the\ninterior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem.\nHowever, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not\nguarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural\nnetwork, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF.

We focus on homogeneous\nPoisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in\n$d$-spatial dimensions.

Despite these\npromising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data\nheterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL\nsystems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable\nadvancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on\nlarge-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these\nissues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results\nin significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance\ndegradation in classification models trained on such data.

To address this challenge, we\npropose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the\npretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP\nsynthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without\ncompromising the privacy regulations.

The extragalactic radio background,\nas detected by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1, suggests a strong radio background from\ncosmic dawn, which can significantly alter the cosmological 21-cm signal,\nenhancing both the global signal amplitude and the 21-cm power spectrum. In\nthis paper, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to check if there is a\nradio excess over the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in mock data, and if\npresent, we classify its type into one of two categories, a background from\nhigh-redshift radio galaxies or a uniform exotic background from the early\nUniverse. Based on clean data (without observational noise), the ANN can\npredict the background radiation type with $96\\%$ accuracy for the power\nspectrum and $90\\%$ for the global signal. Although observational noise reduces\nthe accuracy, the results remain quite useful. We also apply ANNs to map the\nrelation between the 21-cm power spectrum and the global signal. By\nreconstructing the global signal using the 21-cm power spectrum, an ANN can\nestimate the global signal range consistent with an observed power spectrum\nfrom SKA-like experiments. Conversely, we show that an ANN can reconstruct the\n21-cm power spectrum over a wide range of redshifts and wavenumbers given the\nglobal signal over the same redshifts.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable entire\ndocuments to be processed in a single pass. However, their computational cost\nis significantly high.

Recent approaches that integrate LLMs into RAG via iterative\nsummarization either underutilize LLM capabilities or still incur high\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we combine the high accuracy of LLMs with\nthe efficiency of RAG and propose LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control with\nAttention-Based Hierarchical Weighted Graph (PECAN). Our method introduces two\nkey improvements: (1) LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control: We leverage LLMs to\ndynamically control the retrieval process, adjusting the amount of retrieved\ninformation based on different queries to achieve a better balance of\neffectiveness and efficiency. (2) Attention-Guided Retrieval: We propose a\nnovel retrieval method that constructs a hierarchical graph where edges are\nderived by LLM attention weights. Experimental results demonstrate that PECAN\nachieves LLM-level performance while maintaining computational complexity\ncomparable to that of RAG methods on two single-document and two multi-document\nQA datasets.",

An irregular dominating\nset of a given graph $\\Gamma$ is a set $S$ of vertices of $\\Gamma$, having\ndistinct positive labels, whose elements dominate every vertex of $\\Gamma$.\nSince it has been proven that no connected vertex transitive graph admits an\nirregular dominating set, here we introduce the concept of an extended\nirregular dominating set, where we admit that precisely one vertex, labeled\nwith 0, dominates itself. Then we present existence or non existence results of\nan extended irregular dominating set $S$ for several classes of graphs,\nfocusing in particular on the case in which $S$ is as small as possible. We\nalso propose two conjectures.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a central focus in\nboth industry and academia, but often suffer from biases introduced by visual\nand language priors, which can lead to multimodal hallucination. These biases\narise from the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone,\naffecting the attention mechanism responsible for aligning multimodal inputs.\nExisting decoding-based mitigation methods focus on statistical correlations\nand overlook the causal relationships between attention mechanisms and model\noutput, limiting their effectiveness in addressing these biases. To tackle this\nissue, we propose a causal inference framework termed CausalMM that applies\nstructural causal modeling to MLLMs, treating modality priors as a confounder\nbetween attention mechanisms and output. Specifically, by employing backdoor\nadjustment and counterfactual reasoning at both the visual and language\nattention levels, our method mitigates the negative effects of modality priors\nand enhances the alignment of MLLM's inputs and outputs, with a maximum score\nimprovement of 65.3% on 6 VLind-Bench indicators and 164 points on MME\nBenchmark compared to conventional methods. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our approach while being a plug-and-play solution. Our code is\navailable at: https://github.com/The-Martyr/CausalMM",

Despite many advantages, neural\nfields often have a high training cost, which prevents a broader adoption. In\nthis paper, we focus on a popular family of neural fields, called sinusoidal\nneural fields (SNFs), and study how it should be initialized to maximize the\ntraining speed. We find that the standard initialization scheme for SNFs --\ndesigned based on the signal propagation principle -- is suboptimal. In\nparticular, we show that by simply multiplying each weight (except for the last\nlayer) by a constant, we can accelerate SNF training by 10$\\times$. This\nmethod, coined $\\textit{weight scaling}$, consistently provides a significant\nspeedup over various data domains, allowing the SNFs to train faster than more\nrecently proposed architectures. To understand why the weight scaling works\nwell, we conduct extensive theoretical and empirical analyses which reveal that\nthe weight scaling not only resolves the spectral bias quite effectively but\nalso enjoys a well-conditioned optimization trajectory.",

While most\nstudies focus on evaluating the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs) through task accuracy (e.g., visual question answering,\ngrounding), our work explores the related but complementary aspect of\nconsistency - the ability of a VLM to produce semantically similar or identical\nresponses to semantically similar queries. We note that consistency is a\nfundamental prerequisite (necessary but not sufficient condition) for\nrobustness and trust in VLMs. Armed with this perspective, we propose the MM-R3\nbenchmark, which allows us to analyze performance, in terms of consistency and\naccuracy, of SoTA VLMs on three tasks: Question Rephrasing, Image Restyling,\nand Context Reasoning. Our analysis reveals that consistency does not always\nalign with accuracy, indicating that models with higher accuracy are not\nnecessarily more consistent, and vice versa. Furthermore, we propose a simple\nyet effective mitigation strategy in the form of an adapter module trained to\nminimize inconsistency across prompts.

    "abstract": "In quantum cryptography, there could be a new world, Microcrypt, where\ncryptography is possible but one-way functions (OWFs) do not exist. Although\nmany fundamental primitives and useful applications have been found in\nMicrocrypt, they lack ``OWFs-free'' concrete hardness assumptions on which they\nare based. In classical cryptography, many hardness assumptions on concrete\nmathematical problems have been introduced, such as the discrete logarithm (DL)\nproblems or the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problems on concrete group\nstructures related to finite fields or elliptic curves. They are then\nabstracted to generic hardness assumptions such as the DL and DDH assumptions\nover group actions. Finally, based on these generic assumptions, primitives and\napplications are constructed. The goal of the present paper is to introduce\nseveral abstracted generic hardness assumptions in Microcrypt, which could\nconnect the concrete mathematical hardness assumptions with applications. Our\nassumptions are based on a quantum analogue of group actions. A group action is\na tuple $(G,S,\\star)$ of a group $G$, a set $S$, and an operation\n$\\star:G\\times S\\to S$. We introduce a quantum analogue of group actions, which\nwe call quantum group actions (QGAs), where $G$ is a set of unitary operators,\n$S$ is a set of states, and $\\star$ is the application of a unitary on a state.\nBy endowing QGAs with some reasonable hardness assumptions, we introduce a\nnatural quantum analogue of the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption and\npseudorandom group actions. Based on these assumptions, we construct\nclassical-query pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs). Because\nclassical group actions are instantiated with many concrete mathematical\nhardness assumptions, our QGAs could also have some concrete (even OWFs-free)\ninstantiations.",

For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin,\nelectrons move outward (inward) and protons inward (outward) in a region around\nthe BH poles (equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical\npolar angles $-60^\\circ\\lesssim \\theta \\lesssim 60^\\circ$ and the equatorial\nregion $60^\\circ\\lesssim \\theta \\lesssim 120^\\circ$. The polar region shrinks\nfor positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic\nparticle density, we argue the BH could experience a cyclic behavior: starting\nfrom a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons,\ngaining net positive charge, energy, and angular momentum. Then, the\nshrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more\nequatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy,\nand angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The\nextraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region\nreverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this\nelectrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH\nirreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process,\nhence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH\nrotational energy.",

Auditing can take many\nforms, including pre-deployment risk assessments, ongoing monitoring, and\ncompliance testing. It plays a critical role in providing assurances to various\nAI stakeholders, from developers to end users. Audits may, for instance, be\nused to verify that an algorithm complies with the law, is consistent with\nindustry standards, and meets the developer's claimed specifications. However,\nthere are many operational challenges to AI auditing that complicate its\nimplementation.\n  In this work, we examine a key operational issue in AI auditing: what type of\naccess to an AI system is needed to perform a meaningful audit? Addressing this\nquestion has direct policy relevance, as it can inform AI audit guidelines and\nrequirements. We begin by discussing the factors that auditors balance when\ndetermining the appropriate type of access, and unpack the benefits and\ndrawbacks of four types of access. We conclude that, at minimum, black-box\naccess -- providing query access to a model without exposing its internal\nimplementation -- should be granted to auditors, as it balances concerns\nrelated to trade secrets, data privacy, audit standardization, and audit\nefficiency. We then suggest a framework for determining how much further access\n(in addition to black-box access) to grant auditors. We show that auditing can\nbe cast as a natural hypothesis test, draw parallels hypothesis testing and\nlegal procedure, and argue that this framing provides clear and interpretable\nguidance on audit implementation.",

They generalize Wheeler orders\n(Gagie et al., Theoretical Computer Science 2017) and naturally reflect the\nco-lexicographic order of the strings labeling source-to-node paths in the\nautomaton. Briefly, the co-lex width $p$ of a finite-state automaton measures\nhow sortable its states are with respect to the co-lex order among the strings\nthey accept. Automata of co-lex width $p$ can be compressed to $O(\\log p)$ bits\nper edge and admit regular expression matching algorithms running in time\nproportional to $p^2$ per matched character.\n  The deterministic co-lex width of a regular language $\\mathcal L$ is the\nsmallest width of such a co-lex order, among all DFAs recognizing $\\mathcal L$.\nSince languages of small co-lex width admit efficient solutions to automata\ncompression and pattern matching, computing the co-lex width of a language is\nrelevant in these applications. The paper introducing co-lex orders determined\nthat the deterministic co-lex width $p$ of a language $\\mathcal L$ can be\ncomputed in time proportional to $m^{O(p)}$, given as input any DFA $\\mathcal\nA$ for $\\mathcal L$, of size (number of transitions) $m =|\\mathcal A|$.\n  In this paper, using new techniques, we show that it is possible to decide in\n$O(m^p)$ time if the deterministic co-lex width of the language recognized by a\ngiven minimum DFA is strictly smaller than some integer $p\\ge 2$. We complement\nthis upper bound with a matching conditional lower bound based on the Strong\nExponential Time Hypothesis. The problem is known to be PSPACE-complete when\nthe input is an NFA (D'Agostino et al., Theoretical Computer Science 2023);\nthus, together with that result, our paper essentially settles the complexity\nof the problem.",

    "abstract": "We derive exact formulae for three basic annulus crossing events for the\ncritical planar Bernoulli percolation in the continuum limit. The first is for\nthe probability that there is an open path connecting the two boundaries of an\nannulus of inner radius $r$ and outer radius $R$. The second is for the\nprobability that there are both open and closed paths connecting the two\nannulus boundaries. These two results were predicted by Cardy based on\nnon-rigorous Coulomb gas arguments. Our third result gives the probability that\nthere are two disjoint open paths connecting the two boundaries. Its leading\nasymptotic as $r/R\\to 0$ is captured by the so-called backbone exponent, a\ntranscendental number recently determined by Nolin, Qian and two of the\nauthors. This exponent is the unique real root to the equation $\\frac{\\sqrt{36\nx +3}}{4} + \\sin (\\frac{2 \\pi \\sqrt{12 x +1}}{3} ) =0$, other than\n$-\\frac{1}{12}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. Besides these three real roots, this\nequation has countably many complex roots. Our third result shows that these\nroots appear exactly as exponents of the subleading terms in the crossing\nformula. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field\ntheory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Expanding the same\ncrossing probability as $r/R\\to 1$, we obtain a series with logarithmic\ncorrections at every order, suggesting that the backbone exponent is related to\na logarithmic boundary CFT. Our proofs are based on the coupling between SLE\ncurves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The key is to encode the annulus\ncrossing probabilities by the random moduli of certain LQG surfaces with\nannular topology, whose law can be extracted from the dependence of the LQG\nannuli partition function on their boundary lengths.",

GAN is essentially a two-player zero-sum game between the\ngenerator and the discriminator. The same concept can be applied to AT with\nattacker and classifier as players. Training these models is challenging as a\npure Nash equilibrium may not exist and even finding the mixed Nash equilibrium\nis difficult as training algorithms for both GAN and AT have a large-scale\nstrategy space. Extending our preliminary model DO-GAN, we propose the methods\nto apply the double oracle framework concept to Adversarial Neural Architecture\nSearch (NAS for GAN) and Adversarial Training (NAS for AT) algorithms. We first\ngeneralize the players' strategies as the trained models of generator and\ndiscriminator from the best response oracles. We then compute the\nmeta-strategies using a linear program. For scalability of the framework where\nmultiple network models of best responses are stored in the memory, we prune\nthe weakly-dominated players' strategies to keep the oracles from becoming\nintractable. Finally, we conduct experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and\nTinyImageNet for DONAS-GAN. We also evaluate the robustness under FGSM and PGD\nattacks on CIFAR-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet for DONAS-AT.

    "abstract": "We explore the impact of dark matter annihilation on the 21-cm signal during\nthe cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR). Using modified 21cmFAST\nsimulations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate how energy\ninjected into the intergalactic medium (IGM) through dark matter annihilation\naffects the evolution of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature.\nFocusing on two annihilation channels, photon-photon ($\\gamma \\gamma$) and\nelectron-positron ($e^+e^-$), we examine a broad range of dark matter masses\nand annihilation cross-sections. Our results show that CNNs outperform\ntraditional power spectrum analysis by effectively distinguishing between\nsubtle differences in simulated 21-cm maps produced by annihilation and\nnon-annihilation scenarios. We also demonstrate that the structure formation\nboost, driven by dark matter clumping into halos and subhalos, significantly\nenhances the annihilation signal and alters the thermal and ionization history\nof the IGM. This enhancement leads to a noticeable effect on the 21-cm signal,\nincluding a shift from absorption to emission as dark matter annihilation heats\nthe IGM at lower redshifts. By incorporating observational noise from upcoming\nradio interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we show\nthat these effects remain detectable despite observational challenges. We find\nthat the dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the\n21-cm signal distinguishable from the non-annihilation scenarios for the dark\nmatter masses $m_{\\rm DM}=100$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of\n$\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle \\simeq 10^{-31}~{\\rm cm}^3/{\\rm s}$ ($\\langle \\sigma\nv\\rangle \\simeq 10^{-32}~{\\rm cm}^3/{\\rm s}$ for $m_{\\rm DM}=1$ MeV and\n$\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle \\simeq 10^{-24}~{\\rm cm}^3/{\\rm s}$ for $m_{\\rm DM}=1$\nTeV).",

    "abstract": "Recently, large language and vision models (LLVMs) have received significant\nattention and development efforts due to their remarkable generalization\nperformance across a wide range of tasks requiring perception and cognitive\nabilities. A key factor behind their success is their simple architecture,\nwhich consists of a vision encoder, a projector, and a large language model\n(LLM). Despite their achievements in advanced reasoning tasks, their\nperformance on fundamental perception-related tasks (e.g., MMVP) remains\nsurprisingly low. This discrepancy raises the question of how LLVMs truly\nperceive images and exploit the advantages of the vision encoder. To address\nthis, we systematically investigate this question regarding several aspects:\npermutation invariance, robustness, math reasoning, alignment preserving and\nimportance, by evaluating the most common LLVM's families (i.e., LLaVA) across\n10 evaluation benchmarks. Our extensive experiments reveal several intriguing\nproperties of current LLVMs: (1) they internally process the image in a global\nmanner, even when the order of visual patch sequences is randomly permuted; (2)\nthey are sometimes able to solve math problems without fully perceiving\ndetailed numerical information; (3) the cross-modal alignment is overfitted to\ncomplex reasoning tasks, thereby, causing them to lose some of the original\nperceptual capabilities of their vision encoder; (4) the representation space\nin the lower layers (<25%) plays a crucial role in determining performance and\nenhancing visual understanding. Lastly, based on the above observations, we\nsuggest potential future directions for building better LLVMs and constructing\nmore challenging evaluation benchmarks.",

The brightest gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, with an\nunprecedented detected high energy flux of TeV emission, poses a serious\nchallenge to the above scenario. Different from previous works, we involve the\nlong bursting behavior of GRB~221009A in modeling its external-shocks. The TeV\nemission together with the later multi-band afterglows of GRB 221009A are all\nsuccessfully reproduced. It is firstly found that the TeV emission in the early\nphase is mainly from the co-effort of the external reverse and forward shocks,\ni.e., the inverse-Compton scattering of the synchrotron emission from the\nexternal reverse-shock by the electrons in the external forward-shock. This is\nowing to that the long bursting behavior leads to a long lasting of energy\ninjection into the external shock and the corresponding reverse-shock. In the\nlater phase, the TeV emission is dominated by the synchrotron self-Compton\nprocess in the external forward-shock, which is consistent with previous\nscenario.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses an important gap in rigorous numerical treatments for\npricing American options under correlated two-asset jump-diffusion models using\nthe viscosity solution framework, with a particular focus on the Merton model.\nThe pricing of these options is governed by complex two-dimensional (2-D)\nvariational inequalities that incorporate cross-derivative terms and nonlocal\nintegro-differential terms due to the presence of jumps. Existing numerical\nmethods, primarily based on finite differences, often struggle with preserving\nmonotonicity in the approximation of cross-derivatives, a key requirement for\nensuring convergence to the viscosity solution. In addition, these methods face\nchallenges in accurately discretizing 2-D jump integrals.\n  We introduce a novel approach to effectively tackle the aforementioned\nvariational inequalities while seamlessly handling cross-derivative terms and\nnonlocal integro-differential terms through an efficient and\nstraightforward-to-implement monotone integration scheme. Within each timestep,\nour approach explicitly enforces the inequality constraint, resulting in a 2-D\nPartial Integro-Differential Equation (PIDE) to solve. Its solution is\nexpressed as a 2-D convolution integral involving the Green's function of the\nPIDE. We derive an infinite series representation of this Green's function,\nwhere each term is non-negative and computable. This facilitates the numerical\napproximation of the PIDE solution through a monotone integration method. To\nenhance efficiency, we develop an implementation of this monotone scheme via\nFFTs, exploiting the Toeplitz matrix structure.\n  The proposed method is proved to be both $\\ell_{\\infty} $-stable and\nconsistent in the viscosity sense, ensuring its convergence to the viscosity\nsolution of the variational inequality.

To address its operational\nchallenges, we propose a physics-informed hybrid time-series neural network\n(NN) surrogate to predict the dynamic performance of IESs across multiple time\nscales. This neural network-based modeling approach develops time-series\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for the operating units and integrates them with\nprior process knowledge about system structure and fundamental dynamics. This\nintegration forms three hybrid NNs (long-term, slow, and fast MLPs) that\npredict the entire system dynamics across multiple time scales. Leveraging\nthese MLPs, we design an NN-based scheduler and an NN-based economic model\npredictive control (NEMPC) framework to meet global operational requirements:\nrapid electrical power responsiveness to operators requests, adequate cooling\nsupply to customers, and increased system profitability, while addressing the\ndynamic time-scale multiplicity present in IESs. The proposed day-ahead\nscheduler is formulated using the ReLU network-based MLP, which effectively\nrepresents IES performance under a broad range of conditions from a long-term\nperspective. The scheduler is then exactly recast into a mixed-integer linear\nprogramming problem for efficient evaluation. The real-time NEMPC, based on\nslow and fast MLPs, comprises two sequential distributed control agents: a slow\nNEMPC for the cooling-dominant subsystem with slower transient responses and a\nfast NEMPC for the power-dominant subsystem with faster responses. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that the developed scheduler and NEMPC schemes\noutperform their respective benchmark scheduler and controller by about 25% and\n40%. Together, they enhance overall system performance by over 70% compared to\nbenchmark approaches.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal neural networks have shown great promise in urban scenarios by\neffectively capturing temporal and spatial correlations. However, urban\nenvironments are constantly evolving, and current model evaluations are often\nlimited to traffic scenarios and use data mainly collected only a few weeks\nafter training period to evaluate model performance. The generalization ability\nof these models remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose a\nSpatiotemporal Out-of-Distribution (ST-OOD) benchmark, which comprises six\nurban scenario: bike-sharing, 311 services, pedestrian counts, traffic speed,\ntraffic flow, ride-hailing demand, and bike-sharing, each with in-distribution\n(same year) and out-of-distribution (next years) settings. We extensively\nevaluate state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models and find that their performance\ndegrades significantly in out-of-distribution settings, with most models\nperforming even worse than a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our findings\nsuggest that current leading methods tend to over-rely on parameters to overfit\ntraining data, which may lead to good performance on in-distribution data but\noften results in poor generalization. We also investigated whether dropout\ncould mitigate the negative effects of overfitting. Our results showed that a\nslight dropout rate could significantly improve generalization performance on\nmost datasets, with minimal impact on in-distribution performance. However,\nbalancing in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance remains a\nchallenging problem. We hope that the proposed benchmark will encourage further\nresearch on this critical issue.",

On aggregate, we find that India\noutperforms most other nations in the growth of various indicators of\ndevelopment with urbanization, including income and human development. These\nresults are due in part to India's present low levels of urbanization but also\ndemonstrate the transformational role of its cities in driving\nmulti-dimensional development. To test these changes at the more local level,\nwe study the income distributions of large Indian cities to find evidence for\nhigh positive growth in the lowest decile (poorest) of the population, enabling\nsharp reductions in poverty over time. We also test the hypothesis that\ninequality-reducing cities are more attractive destinations for rural migrants.\nFinally, we use income distributions to characterize changes in poverty rates\ndirectly. This shows much lower levels of poverty in urban India and especially\nin its largest cities. The dynamics of poverty rates during the recent COVID-19\npandemic shows both a high fragility of these improvements during a crisis and\ntheir resilience over longer times.

However, ARMs often suffer from exponential error accumulation\nover long sequences, leading to physically implausible results, while DMs are\nlimited by their local context generation capabilities. In this work, we\nintroduce Autoregressive Coherent multimodal generation with Diffusion\nCorrection (ACDC), a zero-shot approach that combines the strengths of both\nARMs and DMs at the inference stage without the need for additional\nfine-tuning. ACDC leverages ARMs for global context generation and\nmemory-conditioned DMs for local correction, ensuring high-quality outputs by\ncorrecting artifacts in generated multimodal tokens.

Our experiments on multimodal tasks, including coherent\nmulti-frame story generation and autoregressive video generation, demonstrate\nthat ACDC effectively mitigates the accumulation of errors and significantly\nenhances the quality of generated outputs, achieving superior performance while\nremaining agnostic to specific ARM and DM architectures.

Reinforcement Learning is no different, and epistemic\nuncertainty arising from model uncertainty or misspecification is a challenge\nwell captured by the sim-to-real gap. A simple solution to this issue is domain\nrandomization (DR), which unfortunately can result in conservative agents. As a\nremedy to this conservativeness, the use of universal policies that take\nadditional information about the randomized domain has risen as an alternative\nsolution, along with recurrent neural network-based controllers.\nUncertainty-aware universal policies present a particularly compelling solution\nable to account for system identification uncertainties during deployment. In\nthis paper, we reveal that the challenge of efficiently optimizing\nuncertainty-aware policies can be fundamentally reframed as solving the convex\ncoverage set (CCS) problem within a multi-objective reinforcement learning\n(MORL) context. By introducing a novel Markov decision process (MDP) framework\nwhere each domain's performance is treated as an independent objective, we\nunify the training of uncertainty-aware policies with MORL approaches. This\nconnection enables the application of MORL algorithms for domain randomization\n(DR), allowing for more efficient policy optimization. To illustrate this, we\nfocus on the linear utility function, which aligns with the expectation in DR\nformulations, and propose a series of algorithms adapted from the MORL\nliterature to solve the CCS, demonstrating their ability to enhance the\nperformance of uncertainty-aware policies.",

We also introduce particular supersymmetric webs\ncalled \"consistent webs\", and show that any 5d SCFT defined by a supersymmetric\nweb can be obtained from a consistent web by adding free hypermultiplets. Using\nbirational geometry of degenerations of log Calabi-Yau surfaces, we provide an\nalgorithm to test the consistency of a web in terms of its dual polygon.\nMoreover, for a consistent web $W$, we provide an algebro-geometric\nconstruction of the mirror $\\mathcal{X}^{\\mathrm{can}}$ to $(Y,D,L)$, as a\nnon-toric canonical 3-fold singularity, and show that M-theory on\n$\\mathcal{X}^{\\mathrm{can}}$ engineers the same 5d SCFT as $W$. We also explain\nhow to derive explicit equations for $\\mathcal{X}^{\\mathrm{can}}$ using\nscattering diagrams, encoding disk worldsheet instantons in the A-model, or\nequivalently the BPS states of an auxiliary rank one 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.",

However, there are instances where the observed $A_{He}$ is\nexceptionally low ($<$ 1%). These low-$A_{He}$ occurrences are detected both\nnear the Sun and at 1 AU. The low $A_{He}$ events are generally observed near\nthe heliospheric current sheet. We analyzed 28 low-$A_{He}$ events observed by\nthe Wind spacecraft and 4 by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to understand their\norigin. In this work, we make use of the ADAPT-WSA model to derive the sources\nof our events at the base of the solar corona. The modeling suggests that the\nlow-$A_{He}$ events originated from the boundaries of coronal holes, primarily\nfrom large quiescent helmet streamers. We argue that the cusp above the core of\nthe streamer can produce such very low helium abundance events. The streamer\ncore serves as an ideal location for gravitational settling to occur as\ndemonstrated by previous models, leading to the release of this plasma through\nreconnection near the cusp, resulting in low $A_{He}$ events. Furthermore,\nobservations from Ulysses provide direct evidence that these events originated\nfrom coronal streamers.",

In\nthis context, the paper proposes the Masked Autoencoder with Swin Transformer\n(MAST) framework, where training is performed on a masked subset of HDsEMG\nchannels. A combination of four masking strategies, i.e., random block masking;\ntemporal masking; sensor-wise random masking, and; multi-scale masking, is used\nto learn latent representations and increase robustness against electrode\nshift. The masked data is then passed through MAST's three-path encoder-decoder\nstructure, leveraging a multi-path Swin-Unet architecture that simultaneously\ncaptures time-domain, frequency-domain, and magnitude-based features of the\nunderlying HD-sEMG signal.

In this work, we shift the main\nfocus to frequency representations, modeling time-series data fully and\ndirectly in the Fourier domain. We introduce Neural Fourier Modelling (NFM), a\ncompact yet powerful solution for time-series analysis. NFM is grounded in two\nkey properties of the Fourier transform (FT): (i) the ability to model\nfinite-length time series as functions in the Fourier domain, treating them as\ncontinuous-time elements in function space, and (ii) the capacity for data\nmanipulation (such as resampling and timespan extension) within the Fourier\ndomain. We reinterpret Fourier-domain data manipulation as frequency\nextrapolation and interpolation, incorporating this as a core learning\nmechanism in NFM, applicable across various tasks. To support flexible\nfrequency extension with spectral priors and effective modulation of frequency\nrepresentations, we propose two learning modules: Learnable Frequency Tokens\n(LFT) and Implicit Neural Fourier Filters (INFF). These modules enable compact\nand expressive modeling in the Fourier domain.

Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of\nthe $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although\nthe whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this,\nwe propose a new leptogenesis scenario with the gauged $B-L$ symmetry as\nfollows. First, the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is generated,\ne.g., by the axion inflation, together with the standard model and right-handed\nneutrino $B-L$ charges, with the net $B-L$ charge kept zero. The $B-L$ charges\nin the standard model and right-handed neutrino sectors are then subject to\nwashout effects from the interactions between them. After the washout effects\ndecouple, the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is Higgsed and the magnetic helicity of the\n$B-L$ gauge field decays and generates $B-L$ charges in the both sector; thanks\nto the washout effects, we obtain a non-zero $B-L$ asymmetry.

We adopt the parametric bootstrap method to mimic input data sampling\nand construct the percentile bootstrap CI after estimating the ratio at each\nbootstrap sample. The standard estimator, which takes the ratio of two sample\naverages, tends to exhibit large finite-sample bias and variance, leading to\novercoverage of the percentile bootstrap CI. To address this, we propose two\nnew ratio estimators that replace the sample averages with pooled mean\nestimators via the $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) regression: the $k$NN estimator\nand the $k$LR estimator. The $k$NN estimator performs well in low dimensions\nbut its theoretical performance guarantee degrades as the dimension increases.\nThe $k$LR estimator combines the likelihood ratio (LR) method with the $k$NN\nregression, leveraging the strengths of both while mitigating their weaknesses;\nthe LR method removes dependence on dimension, while the variance inflation\nintroduced by the LR is controlled by $k$NN.

Through a holistically exploration of the\narchitecture modification, we identify three most important layers (i.e.,\npatch-embedding, multi-head attention and feed forward layers) that are\ncritical in adapting to the new segmentation tasks, while retaining the\nmajority of the pretrained parameters fixed. Our proposed model continually\nsegments new organs without catastrophic forgetting and meanwhile maintaining a\nlow parameter increasing rate. Continually trained and tested on four datasets\ncovering different body parts of a total of 121 organs, results show that our\nmodel achieves high segmentation accuracy, closely reaching the PVT and nnUNet\nupper bounds, and significantly outperforms other regularization-based CSS\nmethods. When comparing to the leading architecture-based CSS method, our model\nhas a substantial lower parameter increasing rate while achieving comparable\nperformance.",

A key prerequisite for AI systems pursuing unintended goals is\nwhether they will behave in a coherent and goal-directed manner in the first\nplace, optimizing for some unknown goal; there exists significant research\ntrying to evaluate systems for said behaviors. However, the most rigorous\ndefinitions of goal-directedness we currently have are difficult to compute in\nreal-world settings. Drawing upon this previous literature, we explore policy\ngoal-directedness within reinforcement learning (RL) environments.

We also account for traditional unique\nfeatures of THz, such as molecular absorption loss, user blockages, and 3D\ndirectional antenna beams. Moreover, we model locations of access points (APs)\nusing a Poisson point process and adopt the nearest line-of-sight AP\nassociation strategy. Due to the high penetration loss caused by wall\nblockages, we consider that a user equipment (UE) and its associated AP and\ninterfering APs are all in the same rectangular area, i.e., a room. Based on\nthe proposed rectangular area model, we evaluate the impact of the UE's\nlocation on the distance to its associated AP. We then develop a tractable\nmethod to derive a new expression for the coverage probability by examining the\ninterference from interfering APs and considering the FTR fading experienced by\nTHz communications. Aided by simulation results, we validate our analysis and\ndemonstrate that the UE's location has a pronounced impact on its coverage\nprobability.

    "abstract": "Controllable generation, which enables fine-grained control over generated\noutputs, has emerged as a critical focus in visual generative models.\nCurrently, there are two primary technical approaches in visual generation:\ndiffusion models and autoregressive models. Diffusion models, as exemplified by\nControlNet and T2I-Adapter, offer advanced control mechanisms, whereas\nautoregressive models, despite showcasing impressive generative quality and\nscalability, remain underexplored in terms of controllability and flexibility.\nIn this study, we introduce Controllable AutoRegressive Modeling (CAR), a\nnovel, plug-and-play framework that integrates conditional control into\nmulti-scale latent variable modeling, enabling efficient control generation\nwithin a pre-trained visual autoregressive model. CAR progressively refines and\ncaptures control representations, which are injected into each autoregressive\nstep of the pre-trained model to guide the generation process. Our approach\ndemonstrates excellent controllability across various types of conditions and\ndelivers higher image quality compared to previous methods. Additionally, CAR\nachieves robust generalization with significantly fewer training resources\ncompared to those required for pre-training the model. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to propose a control framework for pre-trained\nautoregressive visual generation models.",

Our story begins with screw dislocations, whose radial\nsurface structure can be smoothly accommodated on $S^3$ for fibred knots by\nusing the corresponding knot fibration. To understand how a smectic texture may\ntake on a screw dislocation in the shape of a knot without a fibration, we\nstudy first knotted edge defects. Unlike screw defects, knotted edge\ndislocations force singular points in the system for any non-trivial knot. We\nprovide a lower bound on the number of such point defects required for a given\nedge dislocation knot and draw an analogy between the point defect structure of\nknotted edge dislocations and that of focal conic domains. By showing that edge\ndislocations, too, are sensitive to knot fibredness, we reinterpret the\nso-called Morse-Novikov points required for non-fibred screw dislocation knots\nas analogous smectic defects. Our methods are then applied to $+1/2$ and\nnegative-charge disclinations in the smectic phase, furthering the analogy\nbetween knotted smectic defects and focal conic domains and uncovering an\nintricate relationship between point and line defects in smectic liquid\ncrystals. The connection between smectic defects and knot theory not only\nunravels the uniquely topological knotting of smectic defects but also provides\na mathematical and experimental playground for modern questions in knot and\nMorse-Novikov theory.",

With this motivation, the S shaped maneuverability test\nof the Ohio driver license examination is chosen here for automatic execution\nby a self driving vehicle with drive by wire capability and longitudinal and\nlateral controls. The Ohio maneuverability test requires the driver to start\nwithin an area enclosed by four pylons and the driver is asked to go to the\nleft of the fifth pylon directly in front of the vehicle in a smooth and\ncontinuous manner while ending in a parallel direction to the initial one. The\ndriver is then asked to go backwards to the starting location of the vehicle\nwithout stopping the vehicle or hitting the pylons. As a self driving vehicle\nshould do a much better job repeatably than a driver, a high order polynomial\npath model is built along with speed profiling to start and stop smoothly at\nthe ends of the path without large longitudinal and lateral accelerations. In\ncontrast to the long horizon, higher speed path planning and path tracking\ncontrol applications in the literature, this paper treats low speed and very\nshort horizon path planning and path tracking control with stopping and\ndirection reversal.

A\nbottleneck in this pipeline is in retrieving relevant evidence: traditional\nmethods may surface documents directly related to a claim, but fact-checking\ncomplex claims requires more inferences. For instance, a document about how a\nvaccine was developed is relevant to addressing claims about what it might\ncontain, even if it does not address them directly. We present Contrastive\nFact-Checking Reranker (CFR), an improved retriever for this setting. By\nleveraging the AVeriTeC dataset, which annotates subquestions for claims with\nhuman written answers from evidence documents, we fine-tune Contriever with a\ncontrastive objective based on multiple training signals, including\ndistillation from GPT-4, evaluating subquestion answers, and gold labels in the\ndataset. We evaluate our model on both retrieval and end-to-end veracity\njudgments about claims. On the AVeriTeC dataset, we find a 6\\% improvement in\nveracity classification accuracy. We also show our gains can be transferred to\nFEVER, ClaimDecomp, HotpotQA, and a synthetic dataset requiring retrievers to\nmake inferences.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new observability property for nonautonomous\nlinear control systems in finite dimension; the nonuniform complete\nobservability, which is more general than the uniform complete observability.\nThe main result of this work will prove that nonuniform complete observability\nis preserved via output feedback. In addition, the duality between this concept\nand the recently introduced concept of nonuniform complete controllability will\nbe proved, leading to the result of preservation of nonuniform complete\ncontrollability via input feedback.",
