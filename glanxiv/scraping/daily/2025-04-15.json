    "abstract": "Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement\nresources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the\nquantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation,\neffective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy\nthese application requirements. In this work, we focus on quantum error\ncorrection-based entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum\nrepeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme\nover multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive\nerror correction scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending\non the network operation point, we adapt the code used in distillation over\nsuccessive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving\nfidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes:\n[[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]]. We compare the performance of four different\nprotocols that combine the codes in different ways, where we define a new\nperformance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and\nfidelity. While we highlight our innovation under minimal assumptions on noise,\nthe method can be easily generalized to realistic network settings. By\ncombining our approach with good entanglement generation methods and smart\nrouting protocols, we can achieve application requirements in a systematic,\nresource-efficient, way.",

Our curriculum learning approach employs a\nreliability-based weight function that measures bidirectional prediction\nalignment between the teacher and CLIP, balancing between confident and\nuncertain predictions. This function preserves uncertainty for difficult\nsamples, while prioritizing reliable pseudo-labels when the predictions from\nboth models closely align. To further improve adaptation, we propose Adaptive\nCurriculum Regularization, which modifies the learning priority of samples in a\nprobabilistic, adaptive manner based on their confidence scores and prediction\nstability, mitigating overfitting to noisy and over-confident samples.\nExtensive experiments across multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Co-STAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFUVDA\nmethods.

A promising approach is to train separate Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)\nand merge them effectively, preserving both content and style. Existing\nmethods, such as ZipLoRA, treat content and style as independent entities,\nmerging them by learning masks in LoRA's output dimensions. However, content\nand style are intertwined, not independent. To address this, we propose\nDuoLoRA, a content-style personalization framework featuring three key\ncomponents: (i) rank-dimension mask learning, (ii) effective merging via layer\npriors, and (iii) Constyle loss, which leverages cycle-consistency in the\nmerging process. First, we introduce ZipRank, which performs content-style\nmerging within the rank dimension, offering adaptive rank flexibility and\nsignificantly reducing the number of learnable parameters. Additionally, we\nincorporate SDXL layer priors to apply implicit rank constraints informed by\neach layer's content-style bias and adaptive merger initialization, enhancing\nthe integration of content and style. To further refine the merging process, we\nintroduce Constyle loss, which leverages the cycle-consistency between content\nand style.

Benefiting\nfrom the strong generalization capabilities of the guided embedding, we\nconstruct refined embedding by using the guided embedding and reduced-dimension\nversion of the base embedding. We then integrate the refined embedding into the\nrecommendation module for training and inference. A range of numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that guided embedding is adaptable to various given\nexisting base embedding models, and generalizes well across different\nrecommendation tasks. The numerical results show that the refined embedding not\nonly improves recommendation performance, achieving approximately $10\\%$ to\n$50\\%$ gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Recall rate, and Normalized\nDiscounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but also enhances interpretability, as\nevidenced by case studies.",

Leveraging this to quantify structural\nalignment in fibrous materials unveils an alternative to destructive\ncharacterization methods. This work introduces metasurface-enhanced polarized\nlight microscopy (Meta-PoL), which employs polarization-tunable,\nguided-mode-resonant colorimetric metasurfaces to characterize molecular and\nbulk alignment of poly({\\epsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers in a far-field\nconfiguration. PCL nanofibers drawn at 0%, 400%, and 900% ratios were\ninterfaced with the studied metasurfaces. Metasurface resonances coinciding\nwith the intrinsic drawn nanofiber resonances - confirmed by Stokes Polarimetry\n- produced the strongest colorimetric enhancement, resultant from\nalignment-specific nanofiber reflectivity. The enhancement degree corresponded\nwith molecular and bulk alignments for each draw ratio, as measured through\ndifferential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy,\nrespectively. Thus, Meta-PoL presents an all-optical, non-destructive, and\nquantitative measurement of nanofiber alignment.",

This observation begs the question: might\nthere exist a 'holy grail' GC algorithm, as yet undiscovered, guaranteeing both\nconstant-length pause times and that memory is collected promptly upon becoming\nunreachable? For decades, researchers have understood that such a GC is not\nalways possible, i.e., some pathological behavior is unavoidable when the\nprogram can make heap cycles and operates near the memory limit, regardless of\nthe GC algorithm used. However, this understanding has until now been only\ninformal, lacking a rigorous formal proof.\n  This paper complements that informal understanding with a rigorous proof,\nshowing with mathematical certainty that every GC that can implement a\nrealistic mutator-observer interface has some pathological program that forces\nit to either introduce a long GC pause into program execution or reject an\nallocation even though there is available space. Hence, language designers must\neither accept these pathological scenarios and design heuristic approaches that\nminimize their impact (e.g., generational collection), or restrict programs and\nenvironments to a strict subset of the behaviors allowed by our\nmutator-observer-style interface (e.g., by enforcing a type system that\ndisallows cycles or overprovisioning memory).",

As a consequence, it is of\ninterest to understand and control the follower's dynamics to optimize the\nsystem performance and permit stable and transparent bilateral teleoperation.\nTo this end, linearity, time-invariance, inter-axis coupling, and passivity are\nimportant in teleoperation and controller design. This paper therefore explores\nthese effects with regard to the follower person in human teleoperation. It is\ndemonstrated through modeling and experiments that the follower can indeed be\ntreated as approximately linear and time invariant, with little coupling and a\nlarge excess of passivity at practical frequencies.

    "abstract": "Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including\nprioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy\nalgorithms.

Consequently, there has been\nsignificant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In\nthis article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed\npriority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The\nscalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching\noperations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high\ncache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank\nerror, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and\ndelay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given\nelement. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue\noutperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes\nshortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications.\nMoreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and\nquality according to the application's requirements.

In this\npaper, we introduce Dynamic-Length Float (DFloat11), a lossless compression\nframework that reduces LLM size by 30% while preserving outputs that are\nbit-for-bit identical to the original model. DFloat11 is motivated by the low\nentropy in the BFloat16 weight representation of LLMs, which reveals\nsignificant inefficiency in existing storage format. By applying entropy\ncoding, DFloat11 assigns dynamic-length encodings to weights based on\nfrequency, achieving near information-optimal compression without any loss of\nprecision. To facilitate efficient inference with dynamic-length encodings, we\ndevelop a custom GPU kernel for fast online decompression. Our design\nincorporates the following: (i) decomposition of memory-intensive lookup tables\n(LUTs) into compact LUTs that fit in GPU SRAM, (ii) a two-phase kernel for\ncoordinating thread read/write positions using lightweight auxiliary variables,\nand (iii) transformer-block-level decompression to minimize latency.\nExperiments on recent models, including Llama-3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Gemma-3,\nvalidates our hypothesis that DFloat11 achieves around 30% model size reduction\nwhile preserving bit-for-bit exact outputs. Compared to a potential alternative\nof offloading parts of an uncompressed model to the CPU to meet memory\nconstraints, DFloat11 achieves 1.9-38.8x higher throughput in token generation.\nWith a fixed GPU memory budget, DFloat11 enables 5.3-13.17x longer context\nlengths than uncompressed models.

The DKO is particularly useful for random dynamical systems\nwhere trajectory information is unavailable.",

We construct a 2D photometric function of the\nspiral arm that can be used in further decomposition studies, validate it and\nidentify the most and least important parameters.

These enhanced cosmological perturbations can induce\ngravitational waves (GWs) due to second order gravitational interactions and\ncollapse as well to form primordial black holes (PBHs), with the latter acting\nas one of the most viable dark matter candidates.

    "abstract": "Business Intelligence (BI) plays a critical role in empowering modern\nenterprises to make informed data-driven decisions, and has grown into a\nbillion-dollar business. Self-service BI tools like Power BI and Tableau have\ndemocratized the ``dashboarding'' phase of BI, by offering user-friendly,\ndrag-and-drop interfaces that are tailored to non-technical enterprise users.\nHowever, despite these advances, we observe that the ``data preparation'' phase\nof BI continues to be a key pain point for BI users today.\n  In this work, we systematically study around 2K real BI projects harvested\nfrom public sources, focusing on the data-preparation phase of the BI\nworkflows. We observe that users often have to program both (1) data\ntransformation steps and (2) table joins steps, before their raw data can be\nready for dashboarding and analysis. A careful study of the BI workflows\nreveals that transformation and join steps are often intertwined in the same BI\nproject, such that considering both holistically is crucial to accurately\npredict these steps. Leveraging this observation, we develop an Auto-Prep\nsystem to holistically predict transformations and joins, using a principled\ngraph-based algorithm inspired by Steiner-tree, with provable quality\nguarantees. Extensive evaluations using real BI projects suggest that Auto-Prep\ncan correctly predict over 70\\% transformation and join steps, significantly\nmore accurate than existing algorithms as well as language-models such as\nGPT-4.",

The common approaches for community\ndetection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into\ncommunities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale\napproaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a\nsuitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust\npartitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability\nfunction. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by\nthe user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at\na suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our\nproposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained\nmachine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a\nscale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale\nselection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted\nand embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark\nnetworks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the\nsimilarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark\nnetwork.

    "abstract": "Overcrowding in emergency departments (ED) is a persistent problem\nexacerbated by population growth, emergence of pandemics, and increased\nmorbidity and mortality rates. Thus, automated approaches for ED layout design\nhave recently emerged as promising tools for boosting healthcare service\nquality. Still, ED design typically involves multiple conflicting objectives,\nwhere the interpretability of the associated solutions depends on the\navailability of intuitive metrics that can capture ED layout complexity. In\nthis paper, we propose graph-theoretic measures to evaluate and rank ED layouts\nproduced by a multi-objective metaheuristic optimization framework with the\nnon-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and generalized differential\nevolution (GDE3). Indeed, Pareto-optimal ED layouts were sought to minimize\npatient flow cost while maximizing closeness between ED service areas. Then,\nthe layouts were evaluated based on local graph measures (degree centrality,\nbetweenness, clustering coefficient, closeness centrality, nodal strength, and\neccentricity) as well as global ones (global efficiency, network characteristic\npath length and transitivity). Then, a multi-criteria decision-making technique\nwas employed to rank the layouts based on either the objective functions, the\ngraph measures, or combinations of both. The ranking results on a real-world\nscenario show that the top-ranking layouts are the ones with the best\ngraph-theoretic values. This shows that the graph-theoretic measures can\nenhance solution interpretability and hence help medical planners in selecting\nthe best layouts. In comparison with the input layout, optimal NSGA-II and GDE3\nsolutions reduce the patient flow cost by 18.32% and 11.42%, respectively.\nAlso, the two solutions improve the closeness by 14.5% and 18.02%,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Metric graphs are important models for capturing the structure of complex\ndata across various domains. While much effort has been devoted to extracting\ngeometric and topological features from graph data, computational aspects of\nmetric graphs as abstract tropical curves remains unexplored. In this paper, we\npresent the first computational and machine learning-driven study of metric\ngraphs from the perspective of tropical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we\nstudy the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform, a vectorization of points on a\nmetric graph via the tropical Abel--Jacobi map into its associated flat torus,\nthe tropical Jacobian. We develop algorithms to compute this transform and\ninvestigate how the resulting embeddings depend on different combinatorial\nmodels of the same metric graph.\n  Once embedded, we compute pairwise distances between points in the tropical\nJacobian under two natural metrics: the tropical polarization distance and the\nFoster--Zhang distance. Computing these distances are generally NP-hard as they\nturn out to be linked to classical lattice problems in computational\ncomplexity, however, we identify a class of metric graphs where fast and\nexplicit computations are feasible. For the general case, we propose practical\nalgorithms for both exact and approximate distance matrix computations using\nlattice basis reduction and mixed-integer programming solvers. Our work lays\nthe groundwork for future applications of tropical geometry and the tropical\nAbel--Jacobi transform in machine learning and data analysis.",

Here, we report the observation of a self-localized, ultrafast\npencil beam near the critical power in a standard multimode fiber (MMF) and\ndemonstrate its application in volumetric multiphoton imaging. We show that\nself-focusing in step-index MMFs, traditionally considered detrimental, can\nfacilitate the formation of a nonlinear spatiotemporal localized state with a\nsidelobe-suppressed Bessel-like beam profile, exhibiting markedly improved\nstability and noise characteristics. By simply launching an overfilled on-axis\nGaussian beam into a standard MMF, a high-quality ultrafast pencil beam can be\ngenerated through a self-localized process and readily integrated into an\nexisting multiphoton point-scanning microscope. We apply this self-localized\npencil beam to two-photon imaging of intact mouse enteric nervous systems,\nbenchmarking with diffraction-limited Gaussian beams and outperforming\nconventional Bessel beams with reduced sidelobes and enhanced resilience to\ntissue-induced aberration. Finally, we monitor the transferrin uptake dynamics\nin a live human blood-brain barrier model by combining NAD(P)H-FAD-based\nmetabolic phenotyping with minute-resolved 3D scans, revealing spatially and\ntemporally resolved inter- and intra-cell heterogeneity.

In computer vision, IVD has become an emerging task that leverages\nvideo from surveillance cameras and audio from remote microphones to localize\nand classify vehicles in each frame as moving, idling, or engine-off. As with\nother cross-modal tasks, the key challenge lies in modeling the correspondence\nbetween audio and visual modalities, which differ in representation but provide\ncomplementary cues -- video offers spatial and motion context, while audio\nconveys engine activity beyond the visual field. The previous end-to-end model,\nwhich uses a basic attention mechanism, struggles to align these modalities\neffectively, often missing vehicle detections.

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have revealed that the meniscus formed near a\nsurface-piercing barrier can significantly alter the propagation and scattering\nof capillary-gravity surface waves, beyond what classic flat-surface models\npredict. In particular, wave transmission increases as the barrier pulls up the\nmeniscus, then drops sharply if the barrier is raised further, overturning the\nmeniscus. Motivated by these findings, this paper develops two linearized\ntheoretical frameworks that incorporate meniscus geometry and pinned contact\nline conditions into capillary-gravity wave propagation and scattering. Model~1\nassumes a vertical wave perturbation of the unperturbed meniscus, thereby\nextending classic flat-surface boundary conditions in a relatively\nstraightforward manner. Model~2 takes a more comprehensive approach, defining\nsurface wave perturbations normal to the curved meniscus and reparameterizing\nboundary conditions in terms of arc length. While Model~1 proves convenient\nmathematically, it is restricted to single-valued meniscus shapes. By contrast,\nModel~2 is capable of describing multi-valued or overturning free surfaces,\nthereby capturing a wider range of physically realistic scenarios. Numerical\nsimulations based on both models reproduce the experimental observations on how\nwave transmission varies with changes in meniscus height and contact angles as\nthe barrier is lifted, underscoring the critical influence of meniscus\ncurvature in small-scale wave-structure interactions. These results establish a\nrobust theoretical foundation for predicting and optimizing capillary-gravity\nwave scattering in microfluidic, industrial, and scientific applications.",

These latter three galaxies also have a\nsimilar stellar mass and might be considered Milky Way analogs. UGCA127 is a\nlow-mass galaxy but almost reaches the same number of dwarfs as the Milky Way\nat our limiting magnitude. We have searched for hints of lopsidedness in the\nsatellite distributions, but found none to be significant. The next step will\nbe to confirm these members through either distance or velocity measurements.",

    "abstract": "As generative AI models produce increasingly realistic output, both academia\nand industry are focusing on the ability to detect whether an output was\ngenerated by an AI model or not. Many of the research efforts and policy\ndiscourse are centered around robust watermarking of AI outputs. While plenty\nof progress has been made, all watermarking and AI detection techniques face\nsevere limitations. In this position paper, we argue that we are adopting the\nwrong approach, and should instead focus on watermarking via cryptographic\nsignatures trustworthy content rather than AI generated ones. For audio-visual\ncontent, in particular, all real content is grounded in the physical world and\ncaptured via hardware sensors. This presents a unique opportunity to watermark\nat the hardware layer, and we lay out a socio-technical framework and draw\nparallels with HTTPS certification and Blu-Ray verification protocols. While\nacknowledging implementation challenges, we contend that hardware-based\nauthentication offers a more tractable path forward, particularly from a policy\nperspective. As generative models approach perceptual indistinguishability, the\nresearch community should be wary of being overly optimistic with AI\nwatermarking, and we argue that AI watermarking research efforts are better\nspent in the text and LLM space, which are ultimately not traceable to a\nphysical sensor.",

While the\ncharge transfer mechanism is consistent with the correct sign of oil charge, it\nis just as important to provide good estimates of the charge magnitude to\nexplain emulsion stability and electrophoresis experiments. Here we show using\nenergy decomposition analysis that the amount of net flow of charge from water\nto oil is negligibly small due to nearly equal forward and backward charge\ntransfer through weak oil-water interactions, such that oil droplets would be\nunstable and coalesce, contrary to experiment. The lack of charge transfer also\nexplains why vibrational sum frequency scattering reports a blue shift in the\noil C-H frequency when forming emulsions with water, which arises from Pauli\nrepulsion due to localized confinement at the interface.

    "abstract": "The scattering of surface waves by structures intersecting liquid surfaces is\nfundamental in fluid mechanics, with prior studies exploring gravity,\ncapillary, and capillary-gravity wave interactions. This paper develops a\nsemi-analytical framework for capillary-gravity wave scattering by a fixed,\nhorizontally placed, semi-immersed cylindrical barrier. Assuming linearized\npotential flow, the problem is formulated with differential equations,\nconformal mapping, and Fourier transforms, resulting in a compound integral\nequation framework solved numerically via the Nystr\\\"om method. An\neffective-slip dynamic contact line model accounting for viscous dissipation\nlinks contact line velocity to deviations from equilibrium contact angles, with\nfixed and free contact lines of no dissipation as limiting cases. The framework\ncomputes transmission and reflection coefficients as functions of the Bond\nnumber, slip coefficient, and barrier radius, validating energy conservation\nand confirming a $90^\\circ$ phase difference between transmission and\nreflection in specific limits. A closed-form solution for scattering by an\ninfinitesimal barrier, derived using Fourier transforms, reveals spatial\nsymmetry in the diffracted field, reduced transmission transitioning from\ngravity to capillary waves, and peak contact line dissipation when the slip\ncoefficient matches the capillary wave phase speed. This dissipation, linked to\nimpedance matching at the contact lines, persists across a range of barrier\nsizes. These results advance theoretical insights into\nsurface-tension-dominated fluid mechanics, offering a robust theoretical\nframework for analyzing wave scattering and comparison with future experimental\nand numerical studies.",

    "abstract": "Given a sequence of polynomials $(P_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with only\nnonpositive zeros, the aim of this article is to present a user-friendly\napproach for determining the limiting zero distribution of $P_n$ as\n$\\mathrm{deg}\\, P_n \\to \\infty$. The method is based on establishing an\nequivalence between the existence of a limiting empirical zero distribution\n$\\mu$ and the existence of an exponential profile $g$ associated with the\ncoefficients of the polynomials $(P_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. The exponential\nprofile $g$, which can be roughly described by $[z^k]P_n(z) \\approx \\exp(n\ng(k/n))$, offers a direct route to computing the Cauchy transform $G$ of $\\mu$:\nthe functions $t \\mapsto tG(t)$ and $\\alpha \\mapsto \\exp(-g'(\\alpha))$ are\nmutual inverses. This relationship, in various forms, has previously appeared\nin the literature, most notably in the paper [Van Assche, Fano and Ortolani,\nSIAM J. Math. Anal., 1987].\n  As a first contribution, we present a self-contained probabilistic proof of\nthis equivalence by representing the polynomials as generating functions of\nsums of independent Bernoulli random variables. This probabilistic framework\nnaturally lends itself to tools from large deviation theory, such as the\nexponential change of measure. The resulting theorems generalize and unify a\nrange of previously known results, which were traditionally established through\nanalytic or combinatorial methods.\n  Secondly, using the profile-based approach, we investigate how the\nexponential profile and the limiting zero distribution behave under certain\noperations on polynomials, including finite free convolutions, Hadamard\nproducts, and repeated differentiation. In particular, our approach yields new\nproofs of the convergence results `$\\boxplus_n \\to \\boxplus$' and `$\\boxtimes_n\n\\to \\boxtimes$', extending them to cases where the distributions are not\nnecessarily compactly supported.",

    "abstract": "In real-world control applications, actuator constraints and output\nconstraints (specifically in tracking problems) are inherent and critical to\nensuring safe and reliable operation. However, generally, control strategies\noften neglect these physical limitations, leading to potential instability,\ndegraded performance, or even system failure when deployed on real-world\nsystems. This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of\nnonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First,\na smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of\npractical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures\nthat the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to\nensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control\nframework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output\nremains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with\nthe constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the\nsystem output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input\nand output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is\nachieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization\nis achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally,\nwe rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the\nproposed design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed methods in handling asymmetric constraints while achieving desirable\ntracking performance.",

Using a sample of open clusters and mock\nfield stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique\ncombination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\\phi, J_Z$) and chemical\nabundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and\nBa) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the\nclustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital\nparameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars.\nNevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads\nto low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical\ntagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient,\nwhich is in line with previous theoretical and observational work.

While\nassociation methods for both quantitative and qualitative traits have been\nextensively developed to analyze population level data, development of such\nmethods are of current research interest for family-level data that pose\nadditional challenges of incorporation of correlation of trait values within a\nfamily. Haldar and Ghosh (2015) developed a test which is Statistical\nequivalent of the classical TDT for quantitative traits and multivariate\nphenotypes.

This\nambiguity raises concerns about standardization and clinical applicability. We\nretrospectively analyzed 719 CT exams across seven protocols, comparing five GN\nmetrics derived from the Duke and Wisconsin approaches. Results showed\nsignificant variability across metrics and protocols, with\nWisconsin_tissue_mean consistently yielding the highest values. Correlation\nstrength varied by protocol, and mode-based metrics demonstrated higher\nagreement, suggesting dose dependence. In the Chest PE protocol, GN values\ndiffered significantly based on reconstruction kernel.

    "abstract": "The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au\nresolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming\nregions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation\nbegin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class\n0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \\le 1900 K$). To investigate\nsubstructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the\nsample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below\n75$^\\circ$, linear resolution $\\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4\nresolution elements ($\\theta_{disk}/\\theta_{res} \\ge 4$). We also considered\nthe effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space\nTelescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper\nlimits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K,\nsubstructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age\nof ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of\ndisk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a\ntrend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher\noptical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that\nsubstructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the\nClass I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent\nonly an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and\nwithout large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across\nevolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked.\nIf protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our\nresults imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be\npresent in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different\ntimes.",

Existing AI-based\ndetection systems struggle to adapt to new attack strategies and lack real-time\nattack detection capabilities with high accuracy and efficiency. This study\nproposes an online, continuous learning methodology for DDoS detection in M-En\nnetworks, enabling continuous model updates and real-time adaptation to\nemerging threats, including zero-day attacks. First, we develop a unique M-En\nnetwork dataset by setting up a realistic, real-time simulation using the NS-3\ntool, incorporating both victim and bot devices. DDoS attacks with varying\npacket sizes are simulated using the DDoSim application across IoT and\ntraditional IP-based environments under M-En network criteria. Our approach\nemploys a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning\nmodels: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet\ndataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly\naccurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low\nconfidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification\nand potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models\ndemonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human\nintervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to\nenhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF\nthrough real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy\nof 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established\nbaselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632\nMB) and CPU utilization (10.05%) in real-time scenarios.",

A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light\nof electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic\ninteractions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using\nfirst-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron\ncorrelation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization\nin the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry,\nwhich reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation\ntransition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the\ncalculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the\nL-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental\nobservations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display\na complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two\ninequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic\ninteractions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and\nantisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the\nmagnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical\naspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase\ndiagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the\nmagnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the\nexperimentally observed phase transformations.",

The proposed framework leverages reforecast data\nfrom West WRF and FZL estimates from the California Nevada River Forecast\nCenter to develop Unet models over the northern Sierra Nevada watersheds, such\nas the hydrologically critical Yuba Feather watershed. We introduce two Unet\nmodel variants, Unet_log and Unet_GMM, that employ specialized loss functions\nbeyond the standard benchmarks to enhance forecast skill. Unet_log utilizes the\ncosine of Error, and Unet_MM uses Gaussian Mixture Model loss functions, to\nenhance FZL forecasts. Results show that Unet based postprocessing reduces\ncentered root mean squared errors by up to 20% and increases forecast\nobservation correlation by about 10% compared to raw WestWRF. Evaluation using\nthe continuous ranked probability score for Unet_GMM further demonstrates\nconsistent improvements across lead times. While performance fluctuates with\nforecast horizon, storm variability, and diurnal forcing, Unet_GMM and Unet_log\nconsistently outperform the baseline.

Moreover, this incremental approach\noften leads to suboptimal renderings, particularly in high-frequency regions\nwhere detail is critical.\n  We propose a fundamentally different approach: we eliminate densification\nprocess with a one-step approximation of scene geometry using triangulated\npixels from dense image correspondences.

As a result, we dramatically shorten the optimization path and\nremove the need for densification.

This approach\neffectively addresses the problem of overestimating direct effects, which can\nresult in the inaccurate identification of mediators with nonzero indirect\neffects. To mitigate this overestimation and improve the true positive rate for\ndetecting mediators, two constraints on the $L_1$-norm penalty are introduced.\nThe proposed methodology's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive\nsimulations across various scenarios, highlighting its robustness and\nreliability under different conditions. Furthermore, a procedure for selecting\nan optimal threshold for dimension reduction using sure independence screening\nis introduced, enhancing the accuracy of true biomarker detection and yielding\na final model that is both robust and well-suited for real-world applications.\nTo illustrate the practical utility of this methodology, the results are\napplied to a study dataset involving patients with internalizing\npsychopathology, showcasing its applicability in clinical settings. Overall,\nthis methodology signifies a substantial advancement in biomarker detection\nwithin high-dimensional mediation models, offering promising implications for\nboth research and clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "Quantum phase estimation (QPE) plays a pivotal role in many quantum\nalgorithms, offering provable speedups in applications such as Shor's factoring\nalgorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for combinatorial and\nHamiltonian optimization often integrate QPE with variational protocols-like\nthe quantum approximate optimization Ansatz or variational quantum\neigensolver-these approaches typically rely on heuristic techniques requiring\nparameter optimization. In this work, we present the QPE-based quantum\nimaginary time evolution (QPE-QITE) algorithm, designed for post-variational\nground state estimation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Unlike variational\nmethods, QPE-QITE employs additional ancillae to project the quantum register\ninto low-energy eigenstates, eliminating the need for parameter optimization.\nWe demonstrate the capabilities of QPE-QITE by applying it to the\nlow-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is a higher order\noptimization problem that has been studied in the context of quantum scaling\nadvantage. Scaling estimates for magic state requirements are provided to\nassess the feasibility of addressing these problems on near-term fault-tolerant\ndevices, establishing a benchmark for quantum advantage. Moreover, we discuss\npotential implementations of QPE-QITE on existing quantum hardware as a\nprecursor to fault tolerance.",

Generating synthetic data\naims not only to create a variety of data for training the models but also to\npreserve privacy while capturing relationships between the data.

We created both SEM and BN models to\nrepresent causal relationships and to capture joint distributions between\nvariables. In our case studies, such variables include, in particular,\ndemographics, types of disability, types of accessibility barriers and\nfrequencies of encountering those barriers.\n  The study compared the SEM-based BN method with alternative approaches,\nincluding the probabilistic Gaussian copula technique and generative models\nlike the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN). The\nproposed method outperformed others in statistical metrics, including the\nChi-square test, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Total Variation Distance\n(TVD). In particular, the BN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving\nthe highest TVD, indicating alignment with the original data.

    "abstract": "This dissertation presents three independent novel approaches for distinct\nscenarios to solve one or more open challenges. The first concern explains the\nfocus on the lifetime of the networks: this dissertation will utilize a fuzzy\nlogic-based clustering protocol with multi-hop transmission for load balancing,\nenergy consumption minimization, and network lifetime prolongation. The\nprotocol forms unequal clusters with cluster head (CH) being selected by fuzzy\nlogic with competition radius. Node distance to the base station,\nconcentration, and residual energy are input variables. The second concern\nfocuses on network stability: we design a type 2 fuzzy logic-based clustering\nschemes in a multi-hop WSN to reduce energy consumption and improve network\nscalability. In this clustering scheme, we propose a cluster head (CH)\nselection strategy where a sensor node is elected as a CH based on type 2 fuzzy\nlogic inputs. To balance the load of CHs we also select their radius size based\non the fuzzy logic inputs. Finally, the third concern is focus on the utility\nof game theory in defensive Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) from selfish nodes\nand malicious behavior. Game theory can effectively model WSNs malicious\nattacks because of their low complexity and scalability. The study, thus,\nexplores different WSN defense strategies from both external attackers and\ninternal nodes acting selfishly or maliciously using the game theory approach.\nAlso, the chapter highlights the general trust model for decision-making using\nthe game theory framework. Besides, the chapter demonstrates the significance\nof the theory in ensuring WSN security from acute attacks and its role in\nenhancing trustworthiness in data and cooperation of nodes in various WSN\narchitectures.",

Under\ncertain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using\nphotometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a\nfinite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified\nlight curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this\nstudy, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying\nfour moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible\nFS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius,\nimplying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and\ntherefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass.\nAdditionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and\nbrightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis\nestablished lower mass limits of $\\sim 0.2$ $M_{\\odot}$ for one lens and $\\sim\n0.3-0.5$ $M_{\\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these\nfindings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\\odot}$\nand dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\\%. These results strongly indicate\nthat the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars.\nWhile further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these\nlenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying\nstellar remnant candidates.",

We derive analytic formulas\nfor electrostatic energy of crystal mixtures, including the effect of static\nion displacements from the lattice nodes, and estimate their residual entropy.\nThen we perform free energy minimization with respect to the order parameters\nfor a C/O mixture at all relevant compositions and temperatures. The resulting\nC/O phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with that obtained in the most\nrecent first-principle study. The equilibrium microstructure of a crystallized\nmixture is shown to evolve with decrease of temperature which, in principle,\ncan induce structural transitions.

    "abstract": "Recently, several observational detections of damping-wing-like features at\nthe edges of ``dark gaps\" in the spectra of distant quasars (the ``Malloy-Lidz\neffect\") have been reported, rendering strong support for the existence of\n``neutral islands\" in the universe at redshifts as low as $z<5.5$. We apply the\nprocedure from one of these works, Zhu et al (2024), to the outputs of fully\ncoupled cosmological simulations from two recent large projects, ``Cosmic\nReionization On Computers\" (CROC) and ``Thesan\". Synthetic spectra in both\nsimulations have statistics of dark gaps similar to observations, but do not\nexhibit the damping wing features. Moreover, a toy model with neutral islands\nadded ``by hand\" only reproduces the observational results when the fraction of\nneutral islands among all dark gaps approaches 90%. I.e., simulations and\nobservations appear to produce two distinct ``populations\" of dark gaps. In\naddition, in the simulations, the neutral islands at $z=5.9$ should be\nshort-lived and should not extend to $z<5.5$. A possible explanation for this\ndiscrepancy is that both simulations underestimate the fluctuations in the\nphotoionization rate and, hence, miss a population of long-lived neutral\nislands, located in the large downward fluctuations of the photoionization\nrate.",

To bridge this gap, we\npropose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated\nlearning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time\ncode execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an\nautomated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time\ncode execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools\nbased on outcome feedback. ReTool employs a systematic training framework,\nbeginning with synthetic cold-start data generation to produce code-augmented\nlong-form reasoning traces for fine-tuning base models. Subsequent RL training\nleverages task outcomes as rewards to iteratively refine the model's tool use\nstrategy, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal tool invocation patterns\nwithout human priors. Experiments on the challenging MATH Olympiad benchmark\nAIME demonstrate ReTool's superiority: Our 32B model achieves 67% accuracy with\n400 training steps, outperforming text-based RL baseline (40% accuracy, 1080\nsteps) in efficiency and performance. Remarkably, ReTool-32B attains 72.5%\naccuracy in extended settings, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%. Further\nanalysis reveals emergent behaviors such as code self-correction, signaling an\n''aha moment'' in which the model autonomously masters adaptive tool use.

The\nmagnomechanical system consists of two cavities: the principal cavity contains\ntwo ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres, and the auxiliary cavity\ncontains an atomic assembly. These two cavities are connected via photon\ntunneling, with the principal cavity being driven by two electromagnetic\nfields. The photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings are responsible for the\nmagnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT observed in the probe output\nspectrum. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of tunneling coupling,\natom-photon coupling, and the magnetic field on the absorption, dispersion, and\ntransmission spectra. We provide an explanation of the mechanism behind the\nFano resonance phenomenon. Additionally, we address the phenomenon of slow and\nlight propagation. Moreover, we demonstrate that group delay of the probe field\ncan be improved by increasing photon tunneling strength. We also show that the\nslow light profile is decreased by adjusting the atom-photon coupling strength.\nThis model is experimentally feasible.

In such a theory, the\nSkyrme field takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to\nthe entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\\dim G \\times \\dim\nG$-dimensional matrix $h$. We also use the holomorphic map ansatz between $S^2\n\\rightarrow G/H \\times U(1)$ to study the self-dual sector of the theory, which\ngeneralizes the holomorphic ansatz between $S^2 \\rightarrow CP^N$. This ansatz\nis constructed using the fact that stable harmonic maps of the two $S^2$\nspheres for compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are holomorphic or\nanti-holomorphic. Apart from some special cases, the self-duality equations do\nnot fix the matrix $h$ entirely in terms of the Skyrme field, which is\ncompletely free, as it happens in the original self-dual Skyrme model for\n$G=SU(2)$. In general, the freedom of the $h$ fields tend to grow with the\ndimension of $G$. The holomorphic ansatz enable us to construct an infinite\nnumber of exact self-dual Skyrmions for each integer value of the topological\ncharge and for each value of $N \\geq 1$, in case of the $CP^N$, and for each\nvalues of $p,\\,q\\geq 1$ in case of $SU(p+q)/SU(p)\\otimes SU(q)\\otimes U(1)$.",

    "abstract": "Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as\nevidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to\nbe unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly\nquantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order\nmultiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest\nastrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry,\nwe show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are\nunderestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly\npredicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate\nreported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent\nmagnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star\nsolutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries\ncontaining one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections\nare expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia\nparallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if\nuncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for\ntriples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically,\nand sources blended with neighboring sources.",

    "abstract": "Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit\nwave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A\nparticularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces\nvariations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles\nbecomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\\,\\text{eV}$, as\ntraditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast,\nthe matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space.\nThese effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary\nmatter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter\ninduced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic\nscalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based\non quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these\nphenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach\nnot only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also\ncovers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects,\nscreening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one\nfinding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the\ndescreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident\nmomentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss\ncurrent and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests,\nequivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably,\nwe go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraints\non the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the\ndecoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing\nthe quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.",

We find that the\nmajority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the\nbeginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping\n-- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and\nmetallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and\ndecreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower\nmetallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars\nfollow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a\nconsiderable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative\nvelocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy.\nAlmost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually\nfall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is\nnegligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended\n(and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc. Mock\nUV images reveal that the observed vertical distribution of its stars is not\nsignificantly broader than in an undisturbed galaxy, indicating that more stars\nwould need to form in the stripped tail than we find in our simulations to\nobservably impact the UV disc width of ram pressure stripped galaxies.",

    "abstract": "A star's ability to explode in a core-collapse supernova is correlated with\nits density profile, $\\rho(r)$, such that compact stars with shallow density\nprofiles preferentially ``fail'' and produce black holes. This correlation can\nbe understood from a mass perspective, as shallower density profiles enclose\n$\\sim 3M_{\\odot}$ (i.e., the maximum neutron-star mass) at relatively small\nradii, but could also be due to the fact that a shockwave (driving the\nexplosion) inevitably stalls if the density profile into which it propagates is\nshallower than $\\rho(r) \\propto r^{-2}$. Here we show that this condition --\nthe density profile being steeper than $\\rho \\propto r^{-2}$ -- is necessary,\nbut not sufficient, for generating a strong explosion. In particular, we find\nsolutions to the fluid equations that describe a shockwave propagating at a\nfixed fraction of the local freefall speed into a temporally evolving,\ninfalling medium, the density profile of which scales as $\\rho \\propto r^{-n}$\nat large radii. The speed of the shock diverges as $n\\rightarrow 2$ and\ndeclines (eventually to below the Keplerian escape speed) as $n$ increases,\nwhile the total energy contained in the explosion approaches zero as the shock\nrecedes to large distances. These solutions therefore represent fluid-dynamical\nanalogs of marginally bound orbits, and yield the ``shock escape speed'' as a\nfunction of the density profile. We also suggest that stellar explodability is\ncorrelated with the power-law index of the density at $\\sim10^9$ cm, where the\nneutrino diffusion time equals the local dynamical time for most massive stars,\nwhich agrees with supernova simulations.",

The intermediate regime of the field\nhas exotic behaviors, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin\nliquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviors, interlayer\ninteractions in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their\nperceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition,\nthey may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer\ncoupling scale.

We first examine their\neffects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on\n$T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the\nanisotropy in intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\\bar 3}$ structure,\nwe show that the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction is the XXZ type due to\nthe symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev type is\ncrucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field.\nFurthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the\ninterlayer interactions.

    "abstract": "We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in an\nErd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi random graph $\\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and\n$b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\\log_b n$, while a simple\ngreedy algorithm revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based\nonly on previously seen vertices finds an independent set of size $\\log_b n$.\nIn his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or\nestablish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open, one of the\nmost prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.\n  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to\nfind an independent set of size $(1+\\epsilon)\\log_b n$ any constant\n$\\epsilon>0$ w.h.p. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and\nextends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges not yet 'seen'\nby the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for all $p\\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$, where\n$d$ is a large constant. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we further prove\nthat our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of\nexceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the\nhalf-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds\nour bound.\n  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem\nby supporting the conjectured optimality of the aforementioned greedy algorithm\nand establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on\na refined analysis of the geometric structure of tuples of large independent\nsets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) commonly used as\na barrier for classes of algorithms. While OGP has predominantly served as a\nbarrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are not stable and our\napplication of OGP-based techniques to online setting is novel.",

To address this, we develop an efficient\ndecoding algorithm designed specifically for full-diversity Construction-D\nlattices.\n  Simulations indicate that the proposed lattices notably enhance error\nperformance compared to full-diversity Construction-A lattices in diversity-2\ncases. Interestingly, unlike AWGN channels, the expected performance\nenhancement of Construction-D over Construction-A, resulting from an increased\nnumber of nested code levels, was observed only in the two-level and\ndiversity-2 cases. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the intensified\neffects of error propagation that occur during successive cancellation at\nhigher levels, as well as the higher diversity orders.\n  These findings highlight the promise of Construction-D lattices as an\neffective coding strategy for enhancing communication reliability in BF\nchannels.",

This\npaper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for\nLiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model\ngenerates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using\nLiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing\nsample pairs.

Third,\nDistillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in\nscore functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion\nscenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion\nmodels, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while\naccelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold.

To model the system, we adopt the PyAutoLens software package,\nemploying a progressive search chain strategy for realizing the transition of\nsource model from multiple S\\'ersic profiles to a brightness-adaptive\npixelization, which uses 1000 pixels in the source plane to reconstruct the\nbackground source corresponding to 177,144 image pixels in the image plane.

Second, while the classical instability can cascade\ntowards higher frequency excitations, it is not driven by high frequency modes:\nAt fixed amplitude, high-frequency modes are more stable than low-frequency\nmodes.

    "abstract": "We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of\nregions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to\nguarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the\ngeneralized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is\nindifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary\ntechniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of\ngeometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the\nalgorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In\ncontrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant\nsurface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and\ntrimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature.\nBatches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\\ caching and\nreusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We\ndemonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD\nmodel, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from\nthe surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model\nnon-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a physics-based deep learning framework for\ndata-driven prediction of wave propagation in fluid media. The proposed\napproach, termed Multistep Integration-Inspired Attention (MI2A), combines a\ndenoising-based convolutional autoencoder for reduced latent representation\nwith an attention-based recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory\ncells for time evolution of reduced coordinates. This proposed architecture\ndraws inspiration from classical linear multistep methods to enhance stability\nand long-horizon accuracy in latent-time integration. Despite the efficiency of\nhybrid neural architectures in modeling wave dynamics, autoregressive\npredictions are often prone to accumulating phase and amplitude errors over\ntime. To mitigate this issue within the MI2A framework, we introduce a novel\nloss decomposition strategy that explicitly separates the training loss\nfunction into distinct phase and amplitude components. We assess the\nperformance of MI2A against two baseline reduced-order models trained with\nstandard mean-squared error loss: a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural\nnetwork and a variant using Luong-style attention. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the MI2A model, we consider three benchmark wave propagation\nproblems of increasing complexity, namely one-dimensional linear convection,\nthe nonlinear viscous Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Saint-Venant\nshallow water system. Our results demonstrate that the MI2A framework\nsignificantly improves the accuracy and stability of long-term predictions,\naccurately preserving wave amplitude and phase characteristics. Compared to the\nstandard long-short term memory and attention-based models, MI2A-based deep\nlearning exhibits superior generalization and temporal accuracy, making it a\npromising tool for real-time wave modeling.",

These solutions are supported by FLASH simulations of\npreheat propagation. Our analysis shows that, asymptotically in time, the\nregions where the magnetization of the fuel is significant tend to become\nlocalized at the interface separating the outer shelf from the inner hot core.\nWe assess the implications of this stratification on the magnetic flux\nconservation and performance of fully integrated MagLIF FLASH simulations.",

In this work, we study\ndiscourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the\nlarge-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken\ncontent via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the\nmeasurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words\nin LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus\nour study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing\n15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse\nwords -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered\ndiscourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse\nwords in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based\nmasculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and\nvideo games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse\nwords from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that\nthe masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than\nthe feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on\ndownstream tasks for men.

This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant\ninterband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting\nquantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but\nbecomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band.\nWe consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and\nshow that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the\norbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models.\nDuring this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between\nthe output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer\nmore information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework\nexhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different\noutput spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the\nstudent model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different\nvocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors\nwith ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the\nstudent/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from\ndifferent models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the\ndistributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm\nto align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the\nabove, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both\noff-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their\nvocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly\noutperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and\nsurpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different\nvocabularies.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved outstanding image generation by reversing a\nforward noising process to approximate true data distributions. During\ntraining, these models predict diffusion scores from noised versions of true\nsamples in a single forward pass, while inference requires iterative denoising\nstarting from white noise. This training-inference divergences hinder the\nalignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential\nprediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem,\nwe propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial\nDiffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during\noptimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial\nsupervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features\na siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and\nlightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling\nstrategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original\ndiffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully\nconstrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the\ninference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion.\nFinally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3),\ndemonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and\nimage quality.",

    "abstract": "Accurate, detailed, and high-frequent bathymetry is crucial for shallow\nseabed areas facing intense climatological and anthropogenic pressures. Current\nmethods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry\nprimarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally\nDerived Bathymetry (SDB). However, SDB methods often require extensive manual\nfieldwork or costly reference data, while SfM-MVS approaches face challenges\neven after refraction correction. These include depth data gaps and noise in\nenvironments with homogeneous visual textures, which hinder the creation of\naccurate and complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed. To address\nthese challenges, this work introduces a methodology that combines the\nhigh-fidelity 3D reconstruction capabilities of the SfM-MVS methods with\nstate-of-the-art refraction correction techniques, along with the spectral\nanalysis capabilities of a new deep learning-based method for bathymetry\nprediction. This integration enables a synergistic approach where SfM-MVS\nderived DSMs with data gaps are used as training data to generate complete\nbathymetric maps. In this context, we propose Swin-BathyUNet that combines\nU-Net with Swin Transformer self-attention layers and a cross-attention\nmechanism, specifically tailored for SDB. Swin-BathyUNet is designed to improve\nbathymetric accuracy by capturing long-range spatial relationships and can also\nfunction as a standalone solution for standard SDB with various training depth\ndata, independent of the SfM-MVS output. Experimental results in two completely\ndifferent test sites in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments that\ndemonstrate improvements in bathymetric accuracy, detail, coverage, and noise\nreduction in the predicted DSM.

We\ncompared our models with observations of SN~2023pel and selected our preferred\nmodel using statistical analysis, taking both light curves and expansion\nvelocities into account. This allowed us to derive a set of physical properties\nfor SN~2023pel.

We analyzed how quintessence\naffects both the size and shape of the black hole shadow, showing that\nincreasing the quintessence strength reduces the shadow radius, contrary to the\nknown results in $4D$. We also propose a speculative methodology to test the\nshadow behavior in five dimensional scenarios, in light of the constraints\nprovided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) concerning the shadow of the\nfour-dimensional supermassive black hole M87. We identify scenarios in which\nthe theoretical $5D$ results could be consistent with these observational\nconstraints.

Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission\nmodel to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we\ninvestigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The\nperiod of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are\nexplained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system,\none intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit\nto shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model\neventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed\n4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to\nexhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show\nthat environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the\nmulti-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19\nnon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute\na natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the\neffects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are\nexplored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae\ndynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of\ndeterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction.

To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled\nsubtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing\nefficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of\nproperty inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the\nessential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors.\nThis paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor\nproperties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train\nsetting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise\nsampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated\nunder various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be\nwell preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling.

    "abstract": "The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open\nfrontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena\nconnecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic\nproper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a\ntestable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated\nSagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between\nclockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay\nexceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to\ndecrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced\ndecoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from\nthe Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation\nspeed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets\nwith a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip\ndesign that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and\nincludes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This\napproach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters,\nwith rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control\ndecoherence.

Dynamic mode decomposition is used to isolate and study\nthe structures generated by the shear layer exposed in the boundary layer.\nResults reveal that the shear layer flapping is the most energetic mode. The\nhot wall gains the highest amplitude for the flapping frequency, and the\nvortical motions are most intense in the vicinity of the reattachment point of\nthe heated wall. The vortex shedding due to the large-scale motion of the shear\nlayer is associated with the second energetic mode.

Both tasks\ncomprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known\nnodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to\npreviously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual\nscenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural\ninformation, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish\nknown nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in\ntransductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge,\nwe propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces\nautomatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal\npositional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each\nnode's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a\nstandard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances\ntransductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on\nthree real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong\nbaselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating\nits ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for\ndynamic graph learning.",

The\nframework consists of the GLL-type nonmonotone decrease condition for a\nsequence, a relative error condition for its augmented sequence with respect to\na Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (KL) function $\\Theta$, and a relative gap condition\nfor the partial maximum objective value sequence.

We prove that for any sequence and its bounded augmented sequence\ntogether falling within the framework, the sequence itself is convergent.\nFurthermore, when $\\Theta$ is a KL function of exponent $\\theta\\in(0, 1)$, the\nconvergence admits a linear rate if $\\theta\\in(0, 1/2]$ and a sublinear rate if\n$\\theta\\in(1/2, 1)$.

Neural operators\noffer a promising way to accelerate simulations, but their practical deployment\nis hindered by several challenges: they typically require large volumes of\ntraining data generated from high-fidelity solvers, tend to accumulate errors\nover time in dynamical settings, and often exhibit poor generalization in\nmultiphysics scenarios.

Our\ninnovation lies in efficient coupling FE and DeepONet subdomains via a Schwarz\nmethod, expecting to solve complex and nonlinear regions by a pretrained\nDeepONet, while the remainder is handled by conventional FE. To address the\nchallenges of dynamic systems, we embed a time stepping scheme directly into\nthe DeepONet, substantially reducing long-term error propagation.

The large northwest protrusion, the ear (or lobe), has two\nbright rims.

Based on this similarity, I argue that two\njets or more shaped the northwest ear of SNR G0.9+0.1 and its two rims. I\nidentified the bright region south of the main shell of SNR G0.9+0.1 as a\njet-shaped blowout formed by a jet that broke out from the main SNR shell. I\nbase this on the similarity of the blowout of SNR G0.9+0.1 with that of SNR\nG309.2-00.6, argued in the past to be shaped by jets. I identify four symmetry\naxes along different directions that compose the point-symmetric morphology of\nSNR G0.9+0.1.

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and accurate\nacross many tasks, some fundamental sources of unreliability remain in their\nbehavior. One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the same\ninformation when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the\ndiscrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of\nthat answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more\nstringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator\nand a validator over the entire set of candidate answers, i.e., candidate\ncompletions that could possibly arise during ordinary language use without\nbreaking Gricean norms. We show that according to this measure, a large gap\nexists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics\ntasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based\ntraining method, and show that it significantly closes the gap, surpassing all\nbaseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain\ntasks and lexical items.",

We first consider an arbitrary potential to implement an effective\ncosmological constant. The scalar field has long range whereas its potential\ncan induce a mass term, rendering its range to short distances. A second effect\nof the potential is the possibility to induce a background curvature or an\neffective cosmological constant via the minimum of the potential. The latter is\nusually ignored in the literature to have an asymptotically flat background for\nthe gravitational waves. In order to fill this gap, we consider the effects of\nthe scalar potential in the framework of gravitational waves in the theories\nhaving such scalar couplings, and compare its effects with other approaches\nsuch as the presence of a vacuum energy density filling the spacetime or a\nlinear potential which leads to an effective cosmological constant but now with\na massless scalar field. We discuss properties of the gravitational waves,\ntheir propagation and interaction with the medium in which they propagate. The\nminimum of the scalar potential term mimics a cosmological constant and leads\nto separate redshifts in the effective frequency and wave number, which also\ndiscriminates the tensorial and massive scalar waves. We see that, depending on\nthe implementation to have a cosmological constant, the propagation speeds and\npolarization properties of scalar modes of these waves is different, as\nsummarized in the paper.",

However, to realize the swimming\nperformance of biology, there is a need for soft robotic swimmers with both\ndistributed muscles and kinematic feedback. This study presents the design and\nswimming performance of a soft robotic fish with independently controllable\nmuscles and embedded kinematic sensing distributed along the body. The soft\nswimming robot consists of an interior flexible spine, three axially\ndistributed sets of HASEL artificial muscles, embedded strain gauges, a\nstreamlined silicone body, and off-board electronics. In a fixed configuration,\nthe soft robot generates a maximum thrust of 7.9 mN when excited near its first\nresonant frequency (2 Hz) with synchronized antagonistic actuation of all\nmuscles. When excited near its second resonant frequency (8 Hz), synchronized\nmuscle actuation generates 5.0 mN of thrust. By introducing a sequential phase\noffset into the muscle actuation, the thrust at the second resonant frequency\nincreases to 7.2 mN, a 44% increase from simple antagonistic activation. The\nsequential muscle activation improves the thrust by increasing 1) the tail-beat\nvelocity and 2) traveling wave content in the swimming kinematics by four\ntimes. Further, the second resonant frequency (8 Hz) generates nearly as much\nthrust as the first resonance (2 Hz) while requiring only $\\approx25$% of the\ntail displacement, indicating that higher resonant frequencies have benefits\nfor swimming in confined environments where a smaller kinematic envelope is\nnecessary. These results demonstrate the performance benefits of independently\ncontrollable muscles and distributed kinematic sensing, and this type of soft\nrobotic swimmer provides a platform to address the open challenge of\nsensorimotor control.",

We first show, in a\ncontrolled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted\nwith only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We\nthen formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a\nblack-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for \"Response Anomaly Vigilance for\nuncovering semantic backdoors\"), which combines semantic entropy with\ncross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with\nstructured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via\nbidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model\ncomparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases.

    "abstract": "Ring artifacts are common artifacts in CT imaging, typically caused by\ninconsistent responses of detector units to X-rays, resulting in stripe\nartifacts in the projection data. Under circular scanning mode, such artifacts\nmanifest as concentric rings radiating from the center of rotation, severely\ndegrading image quality. In the Radon transform domain, even if the object's\ndensity function is piecewise discontinuous in certain regions, the projection\nimages remain nearly continuous in the angular direction, making the ideal\nprojections exhibit a smooth global low-frequency characteristic. In practical\nscanning, the local disturbances of the same detector unit at different\nscanning angles lead to a prominent high-frequency locality of stripe\nartifacts. Existing studies generally model ring artifacts disturbances as\nfixed additive errors, which overlooks the dynamic variation of detector\nresponses during practical scanning. However, the degree of detector response\ninconsistency is a function of the projection values, as revealed in our\nexperiments, thereby requiring consideration of the interaction between global\nand local features in the process of stripe artifacts extraction and\ncorrection. Therefore, we propose a CT ring artifacts correction method based\non global and local features in the projection domain. We employ the VSS block\nand Dense block to respectively correct the low-frequency sub-band, which\ncapture the global correlations of the projection, and the high-frequency\nsub-band, which contain local stripe artifacts after wavelet decomposition.\nSpecifically, the accuracy of artifacts correction is enhanced by the\ninteraction guidance between global and local features. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both quantitative\nmetrics and visual quality, verifying its robustness and practical\napplicability.",

This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention\nin the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two\nprominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable\nspeed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD).

    "abstract": "Purpose: Accurately classifying tissue margins during cancer surgeries is\ncrucial for ensuring complete tumor removal. Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass\nSpectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment,\ngenerates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical\ndecision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts\npresents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a\nfoundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this\nlimitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We\npropose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is\nan adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio\nassociation, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach\nbased on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed\nmodel against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model\nsignificantly improves the classification performance, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\\% \\pm 0.8$. The results\ndemonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected\nbackbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative\nmodels. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted\nand pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data\neven with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation\nmodels for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in\ndata-scarce clinical environments.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of\npixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision,\nclinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its\nsparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models\n(VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the\nexplanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices,\nwe propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language\nsupervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that\ngaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain\nwhy those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first\nlearns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion\nmorphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The\nteacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale\nfeature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2)\nConfidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions;\n(3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments\non the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves\nDice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over\ngaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving\ncorrelations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our\nframework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how\nintegrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can\neffectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals,\nthereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical\nAI systems.

The product $27\\otimes 27$ also has an\ninteresting feature: three equivalent irreps $27$ appear in the decomposition,\ntwo of which are symmetric and can therefore be distinguished neither by the\nquadratic Casimir operator nor by their symmetry under permutation. In this\ncase, it is convenient to use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to derive the two\nassociated, symmetric projectors.

Trained with a large-scale reinforcement\nlearning pipeline from Qwen2.5-72B, Kimina-Prover demonstrates strong\nperformance in Lean 4 proof generation by employing a structured reasoning\npattern we term \\textit{formal reasoning pattern}. This approach allows the\nmodel to emulate human problem-solving strategies in Lean, iteratively\ngenerating and refining proof steps. Kimina-Prover sets a new state-of-the-art\non the miniF2F benchmark, reaching 80.7% with pass@8192. Beyond improved\nbenchmark performance, our work yields several key insights: (1) Kimina-Prover\nexhibits high sample efficiency, delivering strong results even with minimal\nsampling (pass@1) and scaling effectively with computational budget, stemming\nfrom its unique reasoning pattern and RL training; (2) we demonstrate clear\nperformance scaling with model size, a trend previously unobserved for neural\ntheorem provers in formal mathematics; (3) the learned reasoning style,\ndistinct from traditional search algorithms, shows potential to bridge the gap\nbetween formal verification and informal mathematical intuition.

Early\nwarning signals (EWS), summary statistics of infection case time series, show\npromise in providing such advanced warnings. As EWS are computed on test\npositive case data, the accuracy of this underlying data is integral to their\npredictive ability, but will vary with changes in the diagnostic test accuracy\nand the incidence of the target disease relative to clinically-compatible\nbackground noise. We simulated emergent and null time series as the sum of an\nSEIR-generated measles time series, and background noise generated by either\nindependent draws from a Poisson distribution, or an SEIR simulation with\nrubella-like parameters. We demonstrate that proactive outbreak detection with\nEWS metrics is resilient to decreasing diagnostic accuracy, so long as\nbackground infections remain proportionally low. Under situations with large,\nepisodic, noise, imperfect diagnostic tests cannot appropriately discriminate\nbetween emergent and null periods. Not all EWS metrics performed equally: we\nfind that the mean was the least affected by changes to the noise structure and\nmagnitude, given a moderately accurate diagnostic test (>= to 95% sensitive and\nspecific), and the autocovariance and variance were the most predictive when\nthe noise incidence did not exhibit large temporal variations.

Specifically, the\nadvancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline,\nfrom data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the\ndataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative\ndata-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques\nsuch as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation\nalignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training\nphase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic\ncaptions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving\noutputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0\npioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise\nexpectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times\nspeedup while maintaining image quality.

This paper addresses these issues by identifying research\ngaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance\nIndicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness,\ndecentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a\ncustom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and\nanalysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance\npatterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration,\nwhich may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable,\ndata-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying\npotential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional\napproach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for\nresearchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and\neffectiveness of DAO-based governance models.",

The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is a\ntopologically complex genome, made by thousands of DNA (mini and maxi) circles\ninterlinked into a two-dimensional Olympic network. The organisation and\ndynamics of these DNA circles are poorly understood. In this paper, we show\nthat dCas9 linked to Quantum Dots can efficiently label different classes of\nDNA minicircles in kDNA. We use this method to study the distribution and\ndynamics of different classes of DNA minicircles within the network.

From the latter, we\ncan also quantify the effective network stiffness, confirming previous indirect\nestimations via AFM.

    "abstract": "The detectors of the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution\nSpectrometer (MRS) form low-finesse resonating cavities that cause periodic\ncount rate modulations (fringes) with peak amplitudes of up to 15% for sources\nexternal to MIRI. To detect weak features on a strong continuum and reliably\nmeasure line fluxes and line-flux ratios, fringe correction is crucial. This\npaper describes the first of two steps implemented in the JWST Science\nCalibration Pipeline, which is the division by a static fringe flat that\nremoves the bulk of the fringes for extended sources. Fringe flats were derived\nby fitting a numerical model to observations of spatially extended sources. The\nmodel includes fringes that originate from two resonating cavities in the\ndetector substrate (a third fringe component that originates from the dichroic\nfilters is not included). The model, numerical implementation, and resulting\nfringe flats are described, and the efficiency of the calibration was evaluated\nfor sources of various spatial extents on the detector. Flight fringe flats are\nobtained from observations of the planetary nebula NGC 7027. The two fringe\ncomponents are well recovered and fitted by the model. The derived parameters\nare used to build a fringe flat for each MRS spectral band, except for 1A and\n1B due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of NGC 7027 in these bands. When\napplied to extended sources, fringe amplitudes are reduced to the sub-percent\nlevel on individual spaxels. For point sources, they are reduced to amplitudes\nof 1 to 5% considering individual spaxels and a single dither position, and\ndecrease to the 1 to 2% level after two-dimensional residual fringe correction.\nThe fringe flats derived from this work are the reference files currently in\nuse by the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline. They provide an efficient\ncalibration for extended sources, and are less efficient for point sources.",

They exhibit exceptional strength-ductility\ntrade-offs in metallurgy (4-10) and near-continuum adsorbate binding energies\nin catalysis (11-16). A deep understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in\nHEAs is essential for controlling their formation and optimizing their\nstructural and functional properties. However, atomic-scale nucleation in HEAs\nchallenges traditional theories based on one or two principal elements (17-23).\nThe intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple\nprincipal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways\n(5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale\nobservations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect\nmeasurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive.\nHere, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic\nstructure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy\nnuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that\ndecreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As\nnuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce\nwithout misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain\nthese experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways\nmodel, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through\nmultiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only\nprovide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but\nalso offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other\nmaterials.",

Furthermore, the application of network-based\nmethods in multi-omics often relies on similarity-based networks, which lack\nstructurally-discrete topologies. This limitation may reduce the effectiveness\nof graph-based methods that were initially designed for topologies with better\ndefined structures. Results: We propose Subset-Contrastive multi-Omics Network\nEmbedding (SCONE), a method that employs contrastive learning techniques on\nlarge datasets through a scalable subgraph contrastive approach. By exploiting\nthe pairwise similarity basis of many network-based omics methods, we\ntransformed this characteristic into a strength, developing an approach that\naims to achieve scalable and effective analysis. Our method demonstrates\nsynergistic omics integration for cell type clustering in single-cell data.\nAdditionally, we evaluate its performance in a bulk multi-omics integration\nscenario, where SCONE performs comparable to the state-of-the-art despite\nutilising limited views of the original data.

However, one could ask a similar question\nabout unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a\nsmall number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find\nsignificance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm\nexists to learn them.\n  We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to\nan $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates\nand returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\\varepsilon$ in\ntime $\\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open\nquestion of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact,\nour algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity\nknown as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn\n$n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time\n$\\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries\nprepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several\nunitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.\n  In addition, we give a $\\textrm{poly}(n,1/\\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to\ndistinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$\nor $\\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised\nthat one is the case.

Focusing on a\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dissipation can\nbe leveraged to engineer tricriticality via the fusion of\n$2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$-order and $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$-order critical points.

    "abstract": "Feasibility problem aims to find a common point of two or more closed\n(convex) sets whose intersection is nonempty. In the literature, projection\nbased algorithms are widely adopted to solve the problem, such as the method of\nalternating projection (MAP), and Douglas--Rachford splitting method (DR). The\nperformance of the methods are governed by the geometric properties of the\nunderlying sets. For example, the fixed-point sequence of the Douglas--Rachford\nsplitting method exhibits a spiraling behavior when solving the feasibility\nproblem of two subspaces, leading to a slow convergence speed and slower than\nMAP. However, when the problem at hand is non-polyhedral, DR can demonstrate\nsignificant faster performance. Motivated by the behaviors of the DR method, in\nthis paper we propose a new algorithm for solving convex feasibility problems.\nThe method is designed based on DR method by further incorporating a\ncomposition of projection and reflection. A non-stationary version of the\nmethod is also designed, aiming to achieve faster practical performance.\nTheoretical guarantees of the proposed schemes are provided and supported by\nnumerical experiments.",

Inspired by\nseveral watermarking-based forensic methods, we explore a novel detection\nframework based on the concept of ``hiding a learnable face within a face''.\nSpecifically, relying on a semi-fragile invertible steganography network, a\nsecret template image is embedded into a host image imperceptibly, acting as an\nindicator monitoring for any malicious image forgery when being restored by the\ninverse steganography process. Instead of being manually specified, the secret\ntemplate is optimized during training to resemble a neutral facial appearance,\njust like a ``big brother'' hidden in the image to be protected. By\nincorporating a self-blending mechanism and robustness learning strategy with a\nsimulative transmission channel, a robust detector is built to accurately\ndistinguish if the steganographic image is maliciously tampered or benignly\nprocessed.

Classical\nlinear regression, one of the most fundamental methodologies of statistical\nlearning, captures the relationship between an independent variable and a\nresponse variable which both are assumed to live in Euclidean space. Thus,\ngeodesic regression emerged as an extension where the response variable lives\non a Riemannian manifold.

Here we\nfind evidence for a quantum magnetic analogue of supersolid -- the spin\nsupersolid -- in the recently synthesized triangular-lattice antiferromagnet\nNa$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ [9]. Notably, a giant magnetocaloric effect related to\nthe spin supersolidity is observed in the demagnetization cooling process,\nmanifesting itself as two prominent valley-like regimes, with the lowest\ntemperature attaining below 100 mK. Not only is there an experimentally\ndetermined series of critical fields but the demagnetization cooling profile\nalso shows excellent agreement with the theoretical simulations with an\neasy-axis Heisenberg model. Neutron diffractions also successfully locate the\nproposed spin supersolid phases by revealing the coexistence of\nthree-sublattice spin solid order and interlayer incommensurability indicative\nof the spin superfluidity. Thus, our results indicate a strong entropic effect\nof the spin supersolid phase in a frustrated quantum magnet and open up a\nviable and promising avenue for applications in sub-Kelvin refrigeration,\nespecially in the context of persistent concerns about helium shortages [10,\n11].",

    "abstract": "We investigate the electric current response to axial gauge fields in\nnoncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals. The absence of both time-reversal\nand inversion symmetries allows for new types of responses. We systematically\ncalculate the transverse, longitudinal, and Hall responses to axial gauge\npotentials with both linear and quadratic dispersion relations. The transverse\nand Hall responses are of comparable magnitude, while the longitudinal response\nis much smaller. Notably, with increasing frequency, the transverse and Hall\nresponse functions manifest a peak whose height is determined by the properties\nof Weyl fermions and is independent of the axial gauge potential. The main\nfeatures of the response functions survive in the presence of disorders. As\napplications of our results, we propose a Hall type magnetopiezoelectric\neffect, where a transverse sound wave can induce an electric current whose\ndirection is perpendicular to the directions of sound propagation and\npolarization. Our results also provide a mechanism to excite magnons using\nelectric fields and could be useful for magnon spintronics.",

Nevertheless, existing\nmethods have been limited by their reliance on the most recent denoised samples\nas input, rendering them susceptible to exposure bias. To address this\nlimitation, we propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD), a novel approach that\nleverages the historical trajectory of the ODE to predict future steps. ARD\noffers two key benefits: 1) it mitigates exposure bias by utilizing a predicted\nhistorical trajectory that is less susceptible to accumulated errors, and 2) it\nleverages the previous history of the ODE trajectory as a more effective source\nof coarse-grained information. ARD modifies the teacher transformer\narchitecture by adding token-wise time embedding to mark each input from the\ntrajectory history and employs a block-wise causal attention mask for training.\nFurthermore, incorporating historical inputs only in lower transformer layers\nenhances performance and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a\nclass-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis.

Through the development of ConvShareViT, the\nbehaviour of convolutions within MHSA and their effectiveness in learning the\nattention mechanism were analysed systematically. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that certain configurations, particularly those using valid-padded\nshared convolutions, can successfully learn attention, achieving comparable\nattention scores to those obtained with standard ViTs.

    "abstract": "Asteroseismic modelling is crucial for upcoming missions like PLATO,\nCubeSpec, and Roman. Despite significant progress, discrepancies between\nobservations and theoretical predictions introduce biases in stellar\ncharacterisation at the precision required by PLATO. Current models typically\nignore magnetic activity, assuming its effects are hidden within surface\neffects. However, recent studies have shown significant impacts of magnetic\nactivity on the Sun's asteroseismic characterisation using forward modelling.\nUsing GOLF and BiSON observations of two full solar activity cycles, we\nquantified the impact of magnetic activity on solar mean density and acoustic\nradius inversions. Observations were segmented into yearly overlapping\nsnapshots, each offset by 91.25 days. Inversions were performed for each\nsnapshot to determine mean density and acoustic radius, tracking their temporal\nevolution and estimating systematic uncertainty due to magnetic activity. We\nobserved a clear imprint of the magnetic activity cycle on solar mean density\nand acoustic radius through helioseismic inversions, consistent across GOLF and\nBiSON datasets. This imprint is the largest source of systematic uncertainty in\nsolar asteroseismic characterisation. Including low radial-order modes\nmitigates these effects more significantly than previously measured for other\nstellar variables. We recommend asteroseismic values for solar mean density\n(1.4104 \\pm 0.0051 g/cm3) and acoustic radius (3722.0 \\pm 4.1 s), averaged over\ntwo activity cycles. These values account for major systematic errors,\nachieving high precision (0.36% for mean density and 0.11% for acoustic\nradius). These results are promising for high-precision characterisation of\nSun-like stars, a better-constrained mean density being able to enhance the\nprecision of stellar radius estimate, which is crucial for exoplanetary system\ncharacterisation.",

    "abstract": "A Large Language Model (LLM) powered GUI agent is a specialized autonomous\nsystem that performs tasks on the user's behalf according to high-level\ninstructions. It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user\ninterfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary\nsequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions\nsuch as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as\nfilling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on\nsensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security\nrisks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent\nbehaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These\nattacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and\nhuman users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual\nintegrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such\nattacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six\nstate-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human\nparticipants. Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable,\nparticularly to contextually embedded threats. Moreover, human users are also\nsusceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight\nmay not reliably prevent failures. This misalignment highlights the need for\nprivacy-aware agent design. We propose practical defense strategies to inform\nthe development of safer and more reliable GUI agents.",

A\ncentral challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets,\nespecially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming\nsimulations. Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based\nK-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost.\nHowever, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral\ncharacteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate\nquality and impair performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\npheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and\ngenotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and\nfitness prediction. A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC\ndistances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation.\nExperimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that\nPGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable\nperformance to traditional GP. With the same training time, PGU-SGP\nsignificantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on\nmost datasets. Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved\nsurrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate\nselection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.",

In this work, we propose a novel methodology\nfor scalable Bayesian inference in hierarchical mixed-effects models. Our\nframework first constructs amortized approximations of the likelihood and the\nposterior distribution, which are then rapidly refined for each individual\ndataset, to ultimately approximate the parameters posterior across many\nindividuals.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour methodology using challenging stochastic models, such as mixed-effects\nstochastic differential equations emerging in systems biology-driven problems.\nHowever, the approach is broadly applicable and can accommodate both stochastic\nand deterministic models. We show that our approach can seamlessly handle\ninference for many parameters. Additionally, we applied our method to a\nreal-data case study of mRNA transfection.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nthree-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and\ncorrect misleading information in the input, further improving response\naccuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include\n(1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to\ncorrect the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and\n(3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries.\nTo evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the\nhallucination detection task and the question answering~(QA) task, as well as\ntwo datasets containing misleading information that we constructed.

This method\npreserves the core knowledge of lightweight models and facilitates optimal\nsolution discovery under certain conditions.

To address data limitations in studying MSSA sepsis, we extend\nexisting transfer learning frameworks to accommodate transformation models for\nhigh-dimensional survival data.

Another significant development is that statistical\nproperties are rigorously established, including $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$-estimation\nerror bounds of the transfer learning algorithm, detection consistency property\nof the transferable source detection algorithm and asymptotic theories for the\nconfidence interval construction.

Prior work has solely focused\non constrained multi-task settings where there is a one-to-one mapping between\na sample and a task, overlooking the paradigm where multiple tasks may operate\non the same sample, e.g., scene understanding. In this paper, we focus on the\nmulti-task setting with single-input-multiple-outputs (SIMO) and show that it\nqualitatively differs from the single-input-single-output model merging\nsettings studied in the literature due to the existence of task-specific\ndecoders and diverse loss objectives. We identify that existing model merging\nmethods lead to significant performance degradation, primarily due to\nrepresentation misalignment between the merged encoder and task-specific\ndecoders. We propose two simple and efficient fixes for the SIMO setting to\nre-align the feature representation after merging. Compared to joint\nfine-tuning, our approach is computationally effective and flexible, and sheds\nlight into identifying task relationships in an offline manner. Experiments on\nNYUv2, Cityscapes, and a subset of the Taskonomy dataset demonstrate: (1) task\narithmetic suffices to enable multi-task capabilities; however, the\nrepresentations generated by the merged encoder has to be re-aligned with the\ntask-specific heads; (2) the proposed architecture rivals traditional\nmulti-task learning in performance but requires fewer samples and training\nsteps by leveraging the existence of task-specific models.",

Using data from NuSTAR, Swift,\nXMM-Newton, and Chandra observatories, we investigate changes in the pulsar's\ntiming and spectral properties. After more than 20 years of continuous spin-up,\nthe pulsar's spin period stabilized, marking the onset of spin equilibrium.\nThis transition was accompanied by the emergence of a previously unobserved\naccretion regime at $L_{\\rm bol} = (2.0_{-1.0}^{+2.3})\\times 10^{34}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude lower than its earlier quiescent state. After\nthat, the source occasionally switched between these regimes, remaining in each\nstate for extended periods, with the transition time from a luminosity of\n$10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ taking less than 2.3 day. The\nanalysis of the spectral data collected during this new low-luminosity state\nrevealed a two-hump shape which is different from the cutoff power-law spectra\nobserved at higher luminosities. The discovery of pulsations in this state,\ntogether with the hard spectral shape, demonstrates ongoing accretion.

We define the notion of a DAG cover of a general directed\ngraph $G$: a small collection $D_1,\\dots D_g$ of DAGs so that for all pairs of\nvertices $s,t$, some DAG $D_i$ provides low distortion for $dist(s,t)$; i.e. $\ndist_G(s, t) \\le \\min_{i \\in [g]} dist_{D_i}(s, t) \\leq \\alpha \\cdot dist_G(s,\nt)$, where $\\alpha$ is the distortion.\n  As a trivial upper bound, there is a DAG cover with $n$ DAGs and $\\alpha=1$\nby taking the shortest-paths tree from each vertex. When each DAG is restricted\nto be a subgraph of $G$, there is a matching lower bound (via a directed cycle)\nthat $n$ DAGs are necessary, even to preserve reachability. Thus, we allow the\nDAGs to include a limited number of additional edges not in the original graph.\n  When $n^2$ additional edges are allowed, there is a simple upper bound of two\nDAGs and $\\alpha=1$. Our first result is an almost-matching lower bound that\neven for $n^{2-o(1)}$ additional edges, at least $n^{1-o(1)}$ DAGs are needed,\neven to preserve reachability. However, the story is different when the number\nof additional edges is $\\tilde{O}(m)$, a natural setting where the sparsity of\nthe DAG collection nearly matches the original graph. Our main upper bound is\nthat there is a near-linear time algorithm to construct a DAG cover with\n$\\tilde{O}(m)$ additional edges, polylogarithmic distortion, and only $O(\\log\nn)$ DAGs. This is similar to known results for undirected graphs: the\nwell-known FRT probabilistic tree embedding implies a tree cover where both the\nnumber of trees and the distortion are logarithmic. Our algorithm also extends\nto a certain probabilistic embedding guarantee. Lastly, we complement our upper\nbound with a lower bound showing that achieving a DAG cover with no distortion\nand $\\tilde{O}(m)$ additional edges requires a polynomial number of DAGs.",

Popular\nregularization approaches include variational regularization and iterative\nregularization. The former involves solving a variational optimization problem,\nwhich consists of a data-fidelity term and a regularization term, balanced by\nan appropriate weighting parameter. The latter mitigates overfitting to noise\nby selecting a suitable stopping time during the iterative process. A key topic\nin the study of regularization is the relationship between the regularized\nsolution and the original ground truth. When the ground truth possesses a\nlow-complexity structure referred to as the \"model\" it can be shown that under\nappropriate regularization promoting the same structure, the solution to the\nregularized problem is robust to small perturbations. This property is called\n\"model consistency\". For variational regularization, model consistency in\nlinear inverse problems has been studied in [1]. However, for iterative\nregularization, model consistency remains an open question. In this paper,\nbuilding on recent developments in partial smoothness [1], we show that when\nthe noise level is sufficiently small and an appropriate stopping criterion is\nused, iterative regularization is model consistent as well. Moreover, we show\nthat the considered algorithm exhibits local linear behavior of the\nregularization. We provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical\nfindings.",

Then, we\npropose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger\nexplosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the\nphysical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close\ndynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical\nequilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account\nfor the collision of a 10M$_\\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles\nwith a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \\msun.

Recently, Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique to optimize resource\nallocation policies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent\nlearns a policy through interaction with the environment, guided solely by\nreward signals that indicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing\nalgorithms are not suitable for dynamic environments such as business\nprocesses. Furthermore, existing DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward\nfunctions that approximate the desired objective, but a misalignment between\nreward and objective can lead to undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To\naddress these issues, we propose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward\nfunction to optimize the objective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves\nthe policy by evaluating execution trajectories following different actions.\nOur reward function directly decomposes the objective function of minimizing\nthe cycle time, such that trial-and-error reward engineering becomes\nunnecessary. We evaluated our method in six scenarios, for which the optimal\npolicy can be computed, and on a set of increasingly complex, realistically\nsized process models. The results show that our algorithm can learn the optimal\npolicy for the scenarios and outperform or match the best heuristics on the\nrealistically sized business processes.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the well-known local maximum problem of the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in blind intersymbol interference (ISI)\nchannel estimation. This problem primarily results from phase and shift\nambiguity during initialization, which blind estimation is inherently unable to\ndistinguish. We propose an effective initialization refinement algorithm that\nutilizes the decoder output as a model selection metric, incorporating a\ntechnique to detect phase and shift ambiguity. Our results show that the\nproposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of local maximum cases to\nnearly one-third for a 3-tap ISI channel under highly uncertain initial\nconditions. The improvement becomes more pronounced as initial errors increase\nand the channel memory grows. When used in a turbo equalizer, the proposed\nalgorithm is required only in the first turbo iteration, which limits any\ncomplexity increase with subsequent iterations.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning is the fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). Due\nto the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks:\ni) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii)\nthese benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the\never-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable,\nauto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic\nPolynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which\nprovides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can\ngenerate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver:\nwhich provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both\nonline and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and\niii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze\nthe performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha\nmoments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments\nover widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the\nperformances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that\nNPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the\nmost powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\no1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of\ntokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\nDeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem\ninstances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first\never-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable\ntestbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).",

    "abstract": "Guided wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) remains a powerful\nstrategy for identifying early-stage defects and safeguarding vital aerospace\nstructures. Yet, its practical use is often hindered by the enormous,\nhigh-dimensional data streams produced by sensor arrays operating at megahertz\nsampling rates, coupled with the added complexity of shifts in environmental\nand operational conditions (EOCs). Studies have explored various\ndata-compression approaches that retain critical diagnostic details in a\nlower-dimensional latent space. While conventional techniques can streamline\ndimensionality to some extent, they do not always capture the nonlinear\ninteractions typical of guided waves. Manifold learning, as illustrated by\nDiffusion Maps, tackles these nonlinearities by deriving low-dimensional\nembeddings directly from wave signals, minimizing the need for manual feature\nextraction. In parallel, developments in deep learning -- particularly\nautoencoders -- provide an encoder-decoder model for both data compression and\nreconstruction. Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) and variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) have been particularly effective for guided wave applications. However,\ncurrent methods can still struggle to maintain accurate state estimation under\nchanging EOCs, and they are often limited to a single task. In response, the\nproposed framework adopts a two-fold strategy: it compresses high-dimensional\nsignals into lower-dimensional representations and then leverages those\nrepresentations to both estimate structural states and reconstruct the original\ndata, even as conditions vary. Applied to two real-world SHM use-cases, this\nintegrated method has proven its ability to preserve and retrieve key damage\nsignatures under noise, shifting operational parameters, and other complicating\nfactors.",

While recent\nmethods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on\ngeometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from\nthe point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation\nfor 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images,\nleading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for\nestimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method\ncombines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified\nnetwork to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets,\nand NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted\nclass based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part.\nFinally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to\nrecover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we\nintroduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date,\nfeaturing photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real\nsensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.

    "abstract": "We present a first-order logic equipped with an \"asymmetric\" directed notion\nof equality, which can be thought of as transitions/rewrites between terms,\nallowing for types to be interpreted as preorders. We then provide a universal\nproperty to such \"directed equalities\" by describing introduction and\nelimination rules that allows them to be contracted only with certain syntactic\nrestrictions, based on polarity, which do not allow for symmetry to be derived.\nWe give a characterization of such directed equality as a relative left\nadjoint, generalizing the idea by Lawvere of equality as left adjoint. The\nlogic is equipped with a precise syntactic system of polarities, inspired by\ndinaturality, that keeps track of the occurrence of variables\n(positive/negative/both). The semantics of this logic and its system of\nvariances is then captured categorically using the notion of directed doctrine,\nwhich we prove sound and complete with respect to the syntax.",

Here, we develop a general MLIP by leveraging the graph neural\nnetwork-based MACE architecture and active-learning strategies to accurately\ncapture vibrational dynamics across a range of polyacene-based molecular\ncrystals, namely naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene. Through\ncareful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and\nenable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and\nvibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest\nsystems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of\nmolecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational\ncoupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a\nframework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex\nmolecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering\nvibrational interactions in molecular environments.",

This paper introduces an innovative multimodal feature\nlearning framework for personality analysis in short video clips. For visual\nprocessing, we construct a facial graph and design a Geo-based two-stream\nnetwork incorporating an attention mechanism, leveraging both Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture\nstatic facial expressions. Additionally, ResNet18 and VGGFace networks are\nemployed to extract global scene and facial appearance features at the frame\nlevel. To capture dynamic temporal information, we integrate a BiGRU with a\ntemporal attention module for extracting salient frame representations. To\nenhance the model's robustness, we incorporate the VGGish CNN for audio-based\nfeatures and XLM-Roberta for text-based features. Finally, a multimodal channel\nattention mechanism is introduced to integrate different modalities, and a\nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model is used to predict personality\ntraits. Experimental results confirm that our proposed framework surpasses\nexisting state-of-the-art approaches in performance.",

Our construction explicitly describes the simplices of\n$\\Omega X$ directly in terms of the simplices of $X$. Working at a purely\ncombinatorial level, we show two main results that confirm the (combinatorial)\nalgebraic topology of our $\\Omega X$ behaves like that of the topological based\nloop space. Whereas our $\\Omega X$ is generally a disconnected simplical\ncomplex, each component of $\\Omega X$ has the same edge group, up to\nisomorphism. We show an isomorphism between the edge group of $\\Omega X$ and\nthe combinatorial second homotopy group of $X$ as it has been defined in\nseparate work (arxiv:2503.23651). Finally, we enter the topological setting\nand, relying on prior work of Stone, show a homotopy equivalence between the\nspatial realization of our $\\Omega X$ and the based loop space of the spatial\nrealization of $X$.",

When the nonlinear effect is\nespecially dominant, there exists a sequence of solitary waves that are\narbitrary small in the energy space, which means the small data scattering is\nnot true. However, there is evidence that it is not possible for the solitons\nto be localized in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ and small in $H^{1}(\\mathbb{R})$. With\nsmall and localized data assumption, we obtain global asymptotic behavior for\nsolutions to the gDNLS equation by using vector field methods combined with the\ntesting by wave packets method.",

However, current methods, which predominantly\ndepend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and\nrobustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent\nsparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers\nhigh-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by\nrepresenting scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as\na highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and\nimproving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains\nlargely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance\ndatasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first\nlarge-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning.\nThis dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances,\nand 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object\ncategories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce\nAffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning\nusing 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal\nstructure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align\n3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance\nrecognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat\ndataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain,\nwhile AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen\nand unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the innovative design to achieve advanced optical\nfunctions in natural materials and intricate optical systems inspired by the\nunique refractive index profiles found in nature. By understanding the physical\nprinciples behind biological structures, we can develop materials with tailored\noptical properties that mimic these natural systems. One key area discussed is\nbiomimetic materials design, where biological systems such as apple skin and\nthe vision system inspire new materials. Another focus is on intricate optical\nsystems based on refractive index contrast. These principles can be extended to\ndesign devices like waveguides, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, which\nmanipulate light in novel ways. Additionally, the review covers optical\nscattering engineering, which is crucial for biomedical imaging. By adjusting\nthe real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, we can control how much\nlight is scattered and absorbed by tissues. This is particularly important for\ntechniques like optical coherence tomography and multiphoton microscopy, where\ntailored scattering properties can improve imaging depth and resolution. The\nreview also discusses various techniques for measuring the refractive index of\nbiological tissues which provide comprehensive insights into the optical\nproperties of biological materials, facilitating the development of advanced\nbiomimetic designs. In conclusion, the manipulation of refractive index\nprofiles in biological systems offers exciting opportunities for technological\nadvancements. By drawing inspiration from nature and understanding the\nunderlying physical principles, we can create materials and devices with\nenhanced performance and new functionalities.

The presence of two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 b\nand c, in the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk provides us a unique opportunity for\ndynamical mass measurements, since the masses for these planets are currently\npoorly constrained. Fitting orbital parameters to new astrometry of these\nplanets, taken with VLTI/GRAVITY in the $K$~band, we find $2\\sigma$ dynamical\nupper mass limits of 4.9 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for b and 13.6 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for c.\nAdding astrometry from the newly proposed planet candidate PDS 70 d into our\nmodel, we determine $2\\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 5.3 $M_{\\rm Jup}$,\n7.5 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ and 2.2 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for b, c, and the candidate d\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets,\ncollections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel\nprocessors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is\nthe sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to\ndetermine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have\ndemonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it\ndepends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.\n  In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction\nsets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times\nand identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known\nhash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method\nand to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory\naddresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets\nacross different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear\nhash functions.\n  Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds\non the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear\nfunctions. This represents a significant improvement compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.",

The\nanalysis is further extended to other QPO models, including the Warped Disk\n(WD) and Epicyclic Resonance (ER) models.

To address this, world\nmodels are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions,\nenabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models\nprimarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential\nvisual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model\ndesigned to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of\ngenerating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort\nreadability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content\ngeneration. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text\nRepresentation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while\npreserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict\nfuture GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding\ntext. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the\noutcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to\ngenerate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App\nagents to make more informed decisions.",

These local importance scores are\nrefined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video\ncaptions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and\nthe overarching narrative.

    "abstract": "Small language models (SLMs) support efficient deployments on\nresource-constrained edge devices, but their limited capacity compromises\ninference performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising\nsolution to enhance model performance by integrating external databases,\nwithout requiring intensive on-device model retraining. However, large-scale\npublic databases and user-specific private contextual documents are typically\nlocated on the cloud and the device separately, while existing RAG\nimplementations are primarily centralized. To bridge this gap, we propose\nDRAGON, a distributed RAG framework to enhance on-device SLMs through both\ngeneral and personal knowledge without the risk of leaking document privacy.\nSpecifically, DRAGON decomposes multi-document RAG into multiple parallel token\ngeneration processes performed independently and locally on the cloud and the\ndevice, and employs a newly designed Speculative Aggregation, a dual-side\nspeculative algorithm to avoid frequent output synchronization between the\ncloud and device. A new scheduling algorithm is further introduced to identify\nthe optimal aggregation side based on real-time network conditions. Evaluations\non real-world hardware testbed demonstrate a significant performance\nimprovement of DRAGON-up to 1.9x greater gains over standalone SLM compared to\nthe centralized RAG, substantial reduction in per-token latency, and negligible\nTime to First Token (TTFT) overhead.",

This study evaluates the transition to a\nbetter-quality paint and its implications for the wall's long-term\npreservation. The rapid fading of the initial materials required an\nunsustainable repainting rate, burdening volunteers. Lifetime simulations based\non a collections demography framework suggest that repainting efforts must\ncontinue at a rate of some hundreds of hearts per week to maintain a stable\npercentage of hearts in good condition.

However, due to their inherent\nvulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of\nopen-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than\ntraditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on\nadversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks\nof flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose\nrobust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of\nadversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the\nclassic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces\nconflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy\nminimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based\nweighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable\naugmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against\nadversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high\nflexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used\nbenchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The\ncode is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.",

Methods and Materials: We used the RADCURE dataset,\nconsisting of 3,346 patients with H&N cancer treated with definitive\n(chemo)radiotherapy. A probabilistic BN was constructed to model dependencies\namong clinical, anatomical, and treatment variables. The Markov Blanket (MB) of\ntwo-year survival (SVy2) was extracted and used to train a logistic regression\nmodel. After excluding incomplete cases, a temporal split yielded a train/test\n(2,174/820) dataset using 2007 as the cutoff year. Model performance was\nassessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC), C-index, and Kaplan-Meier (KM)\nsurvival stratification. Model fit was further evaluated using a log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) test. Causal inference was performed using do-calculus\ninterventions on MB variables. Results: The MB of SVy2 included 6 clinically\nrelevant features: ECOG performance status, T-stage, HPV status, disease site,\nthe primary gross tumor volume (GTVp), and treatment modality. The model\nachieved an AUC of 0.65 and C-index of 0.78 on the test dataset, significantly\nstratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups (log-rank p < 0.01). Model\nfit was further supported by a log-likelihood ratio of 70.32 (p < 0.01).\nSubgroup analyses revealed strong performance in HPV-negative (AUC = 0.69,\nC-index = 0.76), T4 (AUC = 0.69, C-index = 0.80), and large-GTV (AUC = 0.67,\nC-index = 0.75) cohorts, each showing significant KM separation. Causal\nanalysis further supported the positive survival impact of ECOG 0, HPV-positive\nstatus, and chemoradiation.

    "abstract": "Optical path length and dispersion matching in both measurement and reference\narms of an OCT system is critical for achieving bandwidth-limited axial\nresolution. To minimize or eliminate dispersion mismatch, most, if not all,\nfiber-based OCT realisations employ a reference arm configuration that is as\nclosely identical to the measurement arm as possible. This typically includes a\ncollimator, dispersion compensating material (or sometimes a set of lenses), as\nwell as a mirror (or retro-reflector) mounted on a translation stage. However,\nthis solution makes the total instrument cost higher and the setup bulkier than\nnecessary and it also renders the reference arm mechanically unstable. Here, a\nsimple yet robust, low-cost reference arm setup is presented and its ability to\ncompensate for measurement arm dispersion is demonstrated. We use a single-mode\nfiber cleaved and polished perpendicular to the fiber axis to construct the\nreference arm. The length and material of the fibre is determined by\nconsidering the optical path length and dispersion of the measurement arm.\nExperimental images demonstrate the operation of the novel reference arm in our\nSwept-source Optical Coherence Tomography.",

The model incorporates multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) and entropy minimization (EM) losses to\nfacilitate feature transfer from the source to the target domain. In addition,\nfrequency layer normalization (FLN) is applied to preserve structural\nproperties in the frequency domain, which are strongly influenced by system\ndynamics and are often stationary with respect to changes in rpm.

To investigate the\nvulnerabilities of LLM-based RecSys under backdoor attacks, we propose a new\nattack framework termed Backdoor Injection Poisoning for RecSys (BadRec).\nBadRec perturbs the items' titles with triggers and employs several fake users\nto interact with these items, effectively poisoning the training set and\ninjecting backdoors into LLM-based RecSys. Comprehensive experiments reveal\nthat poisoning just 1% of the training data with adversarial examples is\nsufficient to successfully implant backdoors, enabling manipulation of\nrecommendations. To further mitigate such a security threat, we propose a\nuniversal defense strategy called Poison Scanner (P-Scanner). Specifically, we\nintroduce an LLM-based poison scanner to detect the poisoned items by\nleveraging the powerful language understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. A\ntrigger augmentation agent is employed to generate diverse synthetic triggers\nto guide the poison scanner in learning domain-specific knowledge of the\npoisoned item detection task.

This approach\nintegrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to\nconstruct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently\nfocus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75%\nhigher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for\npick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better\nperformance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects.\nAdditionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs\ninferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These\ncapabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic\nsafety systems in dynamic environments. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/twkang43/sparse-maf-aae.",

    "abstract": "Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or\ngender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to\nrelationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the\nimpact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but\nalso across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a\nmultimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social\nmedia platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly\nspreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a\nchallenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio,\nand visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce\nMuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of\n$\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose\nan innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual,\nvocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist\nor non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and\nmultimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual\ninformation plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and\nmodels. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with\nimplicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low\nagreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying\nimplicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.",

    "abstract": "Earth observation satellites like Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) provide\ncomplementary remote sensing (RS) data, but S2 images are often unavailable due\nto cloud cover or data gaps. To address this, we propose a diffusion model\n(DM)-based approach for SAR-to-RGB translation, generating synthetic optical\nimages from SAR inputs. We explore three different setups: two using Standard\nDiffusion, which reconstruct S2 images by adding and removing noise (one\nwithout and one with class conditioning), and one using Cold Diffusion, which\nblends S2 with S1 before removing the SAR signal. We evaluate the generated\nimages in downstream tasks, including land cover classification and cloud\nremoval. While generated images may not perfectly replicate real S2 data, they\nstill provide valuable information. Our results show that class conditioning\nimproves classification accuracy, while cloud removal performance remains\ncompetitive despite our approach not being optimized for it. Interestingly,\ndespite exhibiting lower perceptual quality, the Cold Diffusion setup performs\nwell in land cover classification, suggesting that traditional quantitative\nevaluation metrics may not fully reflect the practical utility of generated\nimages. Our findings highlight the potential of DMs for SAR-to-RGB translation\nin RS applications where RGB images are missing.",

Our Monte Carlo simulations elucidate\nthe macroscopic origin of this coupling to shear strain, and point to its\nimportance with respect to controlling the orbital order-disorder transitions.\nWe find that the emergence of the pseudocubic state can be rationalized by\nconsidering the competition between this trilinear term and a linear-quadratic\nterm of the out-of-phase octahedral tilting with strain\n($\\Gamma_5^+$(R$_5^-$)$^2$). Illustrating the general nature of these results,\nwe construct a simple function that captures the change in Landau free energy\nat the order-disorder transition, in parameters that are trivial to relate to\nthe concentration of Jahn--Teller active species, temperature, tolerance factor\nand unit cell strain, for a broad range of manganite perovskites.

Here, we introduce STRT, an approach that has the potential\nto enhance the temporal resolution of tomoscopy by at least an order of\nmagnitude while preserving spatial resolution. STRT exploits a 4D DL\nreconstruction algorithm to produce high-fidelity 3D reconstructions at each\ntime point, retrieved from a significantly reduced angular range of a few\ndegrees compared to the 0-180 degrees of traditional tomoscopy. Thus, STRT\nenhances the temporal resolution compared to tomoscopy by a factor equal to the\nratio between 180 degrees and the angular ranges used by STRT. In this work, we\nvalidate the 4D capabilities of STRT through simulations and experiments on\ndroplet collision simulations and additive manufacturing processes.

Despite their potential benefits, concerns about student\nover-reliance and academic misconduct have prompted the introduction of\n\"guardrails\" into AI TAs - features that provide scaffolded support rather than\ndirect solutions. However, overly restrictive guardrails may lead students to\nbypass these tools and use unconstrained AI models, where interactions are not\nobservable, thus limiting our understanding of students' help-seeking\nbehaviors. To investigate this, we designed and deployed a novel AI TA tool\nwith optional guardrails in one lab of a large introductory programming course.\nAs students completed three code writing and debugging tasks, they had the\noption to receive guardrailed help or use a \"See Solution\" feature which\ndisabled the guardrails and generated a verbatim response from the underlying\nmodel. We investigate students' motivations and use of this feature and examine\nthe association between usage and their course performance. We found that 50%\nof the 885 students used the \"See Solution\" feature for at least one problem\nand 14% used it for all three problems. Additionally, low-performing students\nwere more likely to use this feature and use it close to the deadline as they\nstarted assignments later. The predominant factors that motivated students to\ndisable the guardrails were assistance in solving problems, time pressure, lack\nof self-regulation, and curiosity. Our work provides insights into students'\nsolution-seeking motivations and behaviors, which has implications for the\ndesign of AI TAs that balance pedagogical goals with student preferences.",

This state is obtained by solving a free surface problem, which we\nframe as the minimisation of an optimal transport cost over a class of source\nmeasures. The solution consists of a source measure, encoding surface pressure,\nand an optimal transport map, connecting the distribution of mass in\ngeophysical coordinates to the known distribution of mass in $(z, \\theta)$.

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has been indispensable in\nscientific and engineering applications. Recently, deep learning methods have\nbeen widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has\nthree main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer.\nWhile the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of\nsolution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc,\nleaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an\nunsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed\nPINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to\nfind the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural\nnetworks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each\nlayer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture\nparameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of\nPINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our\napproach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior\nusage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as\nthe associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on\nseveral benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers'\nequations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS\nachieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting\nobservation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a\nprominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that\narchitectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior\nperformance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a doped HfO2-based, silicon-compatible\nasymmetric resonant ferroelectric tunnel junction design with a quantum well\nembedded between two ferroelectric layers, replacing the conventional\nmetal-ferroelectric-metal structure. Using a self-consistent coupling of the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we\ndemonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading\nto a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the\ntunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust,\nwhile the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and\nreducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well\nsignificantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak\nvalue of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the\nresistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V.

In this work we propose\nGeneralized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural\nnetwork-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors,\ncan leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be\nother sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth\nendpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In\nmany applications this information is already present or can be acquired with\nlow effort.

To establish this\nresult, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for\nmulti-layer FCNs and ResNets.

This behavior contrasts\nsharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems.\nConsequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK\ndoes not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples\nas the network width increases. We validate our theoretical results through\nexperiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST classification task.

    "abstract": "Cavitation has historically been related to parameters measured at\nequilibrium, such as vapor pressure and surface tension. However, nucleation\nmight occur when the liquid is metastable, especially for fast phenomena such\nas cavitation induced by high-frequency acoustic waves. This is one of the\nreasons for the large discrepancy between the experimental estimate of the\ncavitation threshold and the theory's predictions.\n  Our investigation aims to identify nucleation thresholds in various\nsubstances characterized by different physical properties. The experiments were\nperformed by initiating nucleation through ultrasound at 24 kHz. The cavitation\nonset was studied using a novel procedure based on high-speed imaging and\nacoustic measurements with a hydrophone. Combining these two techniques allowed\nus to define the exact instant cavitation occurred in the liquid medium. The\nbubble nucleation was framed at 200,000 fps with a spatial resolution in the\norder of micrometers. Such fine temporal and spatial resolutions allowed us to\ntrack the expansion of the cavitation bubble right after its onset. We tested\nfive different substances and tracked the amplitude of the transducer\noscillation to reconstruct the pressure field when cavitation occurs. This\nallows us to identify the liquid's acoustic cavitation threshold (tensile\nstrength). The data collected confirmed that the vapor pressure is not a good\nindicator of the occurrence of cavitation for acoustic systems. Furthermore,\nall substances exhibit similar behavior despite their different physical\nproperties. This might seem counterintuitive, but it sheds light on the\nnucleation mechanism that originates cavitation in a lab-scale acoustic system.",

    "abstract": "Due to the recent developments in the field of full-duplex radios and\ncognitive radios, a new class of reactive jamming attacks has gained attention\nwherein an adversary transmits jamming energy over the victim's frequency band\nand also monitors various energy statistics in the network so as to detect\ncountermeasures, thereby trapping the victim. Although cooperative mitigation\nstrategies against such security threats exist, they are known to incur\nspectral-efficiency loss on the helper node, and are also not robust to\nvariable latency-constraints on victim's messages. Identifying these research\ngaps in existing countermeasures against reactive jamming attacks, we propose a\nfamily of helper-friendly cooperative mitigation strategies that are applicable\nfor a wide-range of latency-requirements on the victim's messages as well as\npractical radio hardware at the helper nodes. The proposed strategies are\ndesigned to facilitate reliable communication for the victim, without\ncompromising the helper's spectral efficiency and also minimally disturbing the\nvarious energy statistics in the network. For theoretical guarantees on their\nefficacy, interesting optimization problems are formulated on the choice of the\nunderlying parameters, followed by extensive mathematical analyses on their\nerror-performance and covertness. Experimental results indicate that the\nproposed strategies should be preferred over the state-of-the-art methods when\nthe helper node is unwilling to compromise on its error performance for\nassisting the victim.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex\nproblems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific\nreports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum\ncomputing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically\ngenerate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing\npre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we\naddress this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific\nknowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system\nto generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, Agent-Q implements\nthe mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end\npipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum\ncircuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides 14,000 quantum\ncircuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12\noptimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE\ncircuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically\ncorrect parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the\nquality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the\noptimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show\nsuperior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and\nbetter parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic\nworkflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can\nbe used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in\nquantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware.",

But the\nconversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each\nelectron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse\nbeta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is\nproduced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard\nelectroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode\ncaused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless\npseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and\nnucleons.

Existing studies often neglect the interdependence between\nsuccessive anomalous weather events and their collective impact on wind and\nsolar power output. Additionally, conventional modeling approaches struggle to\naccurately capture the nonlinear fluctuations induced by these weather\nconditions. To address this gap, this study proposes an uncertainty modeling\nmethod based on stochastic optimization and scenario generation. The Weibull\nand Beta distributions characterize the probabilistic properties of wind speed\nand solar irradiance, respectively, while the Copula function captures the\ndependence between wind speed and precipitation, enabling the construction of a\nwind-solar power uncertainty model that incorporates the joint distribution of\nconsecutive anomalous weather events. A Monte Carlo-based scenario generation\napproach is employed to construct a dataset representing anomalous weather\ncharacteristics, followed by a probabilistic distance-based scenario reduction\ntechnique to enhance modeling efficiency. Furthermore, the unscented\ntransformation method is introduced to mitigate nonlinear propagation errors in\nwind and solar power state estimation. Case studies demonstrate that the\nproposed method effectively characterizes the fluctuation patterns of wind and\nsolar power under continuous anomalous weather conditions while preserving the\nstatistical properties of the original data.

    "abstract": "With the rise of LLMs, a large number of Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nservices have emerged since the end of 2024. However, the effectiveness and\nefficiency of MCP servers have not been well studied. To study these questions,\nwe propose an evaluation framework, called MCPBench. We selected several widely\nused MCP server and conducted an experimental evaluation on their accuracy,\ntime, and token usage. Our experiments showed that the most effective MCP, Bing\nWeb Search, achieved an accuracy of 64%. Importantly, we found that the\naccuracy of MCP servers can be substantially enhanced by involving declarative\ninterface. This research paves the way for further investigations into\noptimized MCP implementations, ultimately leading to better AI-driven\napplications and data retrieval solutions.",

We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular\nvideo synthesis by augmenting observation views - synthesizing multi-view\nvideos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely\nleverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while\noverlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as\na video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints\nbased on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting\nmodel on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic\nwarping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of\nmissing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we\nintroduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction\nloss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D\nscene reconstruction and completion. See our project page:\nhttps://xdimlab.github.io/Vivid4D/.",

The first refers to the efficiency of encrypted\ncomputation during model aggregation, the second refers to tracing malicious\nattacks in an encrypted state, and the third refers to the fairness of\ncontribution assessment for local models after encryption. This paper proposes\na federated learning storage security model with homomorphic encryption (FLSSM)\nto protect federated learning model privacy and address the three issues\nmentioned above. First, we utilize different nodes to aggregate local models in\nparallel, thereby improving encrypted models' aggregation efficiency. Second,\nwe introduce trusted supervise nodes to examine local models when the global\nmodel is attacked, enabling the tracing of malicious attacks under homomorphic\nencryption. Finally, we fairly reward local training nodes with encrypted local\nmodels based on trusted training time.

These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal\nself-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through\ncross-attention MM Blocks.

As ML applications become increasingly complex and widespread across\nindustries, the need to balance system scalability with long-term\nmaintainability has emerged as a significant concern. This review synthesizes\ncurrent research and practices addressing these dual challenges across the\nentire ML life-cycle, from data engineering to model deployment in production.\nWe analyzed 124 papers to identify and categorize 41 maintainability challenges\nand 13 scalability challenges, along with their corresponding solutions. Our\nfindings reveal intricate inter dependencies between scalability and\nmaintainability, where improvements in one often impact the other.\n  The review is structured around six primary research questions, examining\nmaintainability and scalability challenges in data engineering, model\nengineering, and ML system development. We explore how these challenges\nmanifest differently across various stages of the ML life-cycle.\n  This comprehensive overview offers valuable insights for both researchers and\npractitioners in the field of ML systems. It aims to guide future research\ndirections, inform best practices, and contribute to the development of more\nrobust, efficient, and sustainable ML applications across various domains.",

These\nintrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and\nlearning of the body and environment during early developmental stages.\nAlthough computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms\nunderlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus\nprimarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this\npaper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory\nexperiences, called the \"self-prior,\" and investigate whether it can\nautonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active\ninference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior\ngenerates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes\nmismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations.\nThis mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body\nschema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this\napproach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously\nreaches toward a tactile stimulus.

    "abstract": "In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute\nerror (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between\npredictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate\nthe physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly\ncritical concern in scientific and engineering applications.\n  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine\nlearning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system.\nAddressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine\nlearning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in\napplications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting\nerror metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the\nunderlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed\ndynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse\npersistence ($\\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --\ne.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)\nand higher $\\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical\nconsistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that\nmeasure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\\theta$ versus their correct\nvalues. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and\nrecursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz,\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world\nweather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in\ndynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times\nor long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML\nforecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.",

While this can be\nacceptable for use cases where specific user templates are not predetermined,\nit represents a missed opportunity to enhance security in scenarios where\nintegrating PAD with the fingerprint verification system could significantly\nleverage users' templates, which are the real target of a potential\npresentation attack. This does not mean that a PAD should be specifically\ndesigned for such users; that would imply the availability of many enrolled\nusers' PAI and, consequently, complexity, time, and cost increase. On the\ncontrary, we propose to equip a basic PAD, designed according to the state of\nthe art, with an innovative add-on module called the Closeness Binary Code (CC)\nmodule. The term \"closeness\" refers to a peculiar property of the bona\nfide-related features: in an Euclidean feature space, genuine fingerprints tend\nto cluster in a specific pattern. First, samples from the same finger are close\nto each other, then samples from other fingers of the same user and finally,\nsamples from fingers of other users. This property is statistically verified in\nour previous publication, and further confirmed in this paper. It is\nindependent of the user population and the feature set class, which can be\nhandcrafted or deep network-based (embeddings). Therefore, the add-on can be\ndesigned without the need for the targeted user samples; moreover, it exploits\nher/his samples' \"closeness\" property during the verification stage. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art PAD methods confirm the\nbenefits of the proposed add-on, which can be easily coupled with the main PAD\nmodule integrated into the fingerprint verification system.",

    "abstract": "The traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method exhibits limitations\nin its force distribution: excessive attraction when UAVs are far from the\ntarget may cause collisions with obstacles, while insufficient attraction near\nthe goal often results in failure to reach the target. Furthermore, APF is\nhighly susceptible to local minima, compromising motion reliability in complex\nenvironments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hybrid\nobstacle avoidance algorithm-Deflected Simulated Annealing-Adaptive Artificial\nPotential Field (DSA-AAPF)-which combines an improved simulated annealing\nmechanism with an enhanced APF model. The proposed approach integrates a\nLeader-Follower distributed formation strategy with the APF framework, where\nthe resultant force formulation is redefined to smooth UAV trajectories.

Traditional AD methods typically require the\navailability of normal training samples; however, this assumption is not always\nfeasible. Recently, the rich pretraining knowledge of CLIP has shown promising\nzero-shot generalization in detecting anomalies without the need for training\nsamples from target domains. However, CLIP's coarse-grained image-text\nalignment limits localization and detection performance for fine-grained\nanomalies due to: (1) spatial misalignment, and (2) the limited sensitivity of\nglobal features to local anomalous patterns. In this paper, we propose Crane\nwhich tackles both problems. First, we introduce a correlation-based attention\nmodule to retain spatial alignment more accurately. Second, to boost the\nmodel's awareness of fine-grained anomalies, we condition the learnable prompts\nof the text encoder on image context extracted from the vision encoder and\nperform a local-to-global representation fusion. Moreover, our method can\nincorporate vision foundation models such as DINOv2 to further enhance spatial\nunderstanding and localization. The key insight of Crane is to balance\nlearnable adaptations for modeling anomalous concepts with non-learnable\nadaptations that preserve and exploit generalized pretrained knowledge, thereby\nminimizing in-domain overfitting and maximizing performance on unseen domains.\nExtensive evaluation across 14 diverse industrial and medical datasets\ndemonstrates that Crane consistently improves the state-of-the-art ZSAD from 2%\nto 28%, at both image and pixel levels, while remaining competitive in\ninference speed.

Despite recent\nadvancements, existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they may\nrequire running an RL process on each downstream task to achieve a satisfactory\nperformance, they may need access to datasets with good coverage or\nwell-curated task-specific samples, or they may pre-train policies with\nunsupervised losses that are poorly correlated with the downstream tasks of\ninterest. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm regularizing\nunsupervised RL towards imitating trajectories from unlabeled behavior\ndatasets. The key technical novelty of our method, called Forward-Backward\nRepresentations with Conditional-Policy Regularization, is to train\nforward-backward representations to embed the unlabeled trajectories to the\nsame latent space used to represent states, rewards, and policies, and use a\nlatent-conditional discriminator to encourage policies to ``cover'' the states\nin the unlabeled behavior dataset. As a result, we can learn policies that are\nwell aligned with the behaviors in the dataset, while retaining zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities for reward-based and imitation tasks. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in a challenging humanoid\ncontrol problem: leveraging observation-only motion capture datasets, we train\nMeta Motivo, the first humanoid behavioral foundation model that can be\nprompted to solve a variety of whole-body tasks, including motion tracking,\ngoal reaching, and reward optimization.

    "abstract": "In various networks and mobile applications, users are highly susceptible to\nattribute inference attacks, with particularly prevalent occurrences in\nrecommender systems. Attackers exploit partially exposed user profiles in\nrecommendation models, such as user embeddings, to infer private attributes of\ntarget users, such as gender and political views. The goal of defenders is to\nmitigate the effectiveness of these attacks while maintaining recommendation\nperformance. Most existing defense methods, such as differential privacy and\nattribute unlearning, focus on post-training settings, which limits their\ncapability of utilizing training data to preserve recommendation performance.\nAlthough adversarial training extends defenses to in-training settings, it\noften struggles with convergence due to unstable training processes. In this\npaper, we propose RAID, an in-training defense method against attribute\ninference attacks in recommender systems. In addition to the recommendation\nobjective, we define a defensive objective to ensure that the distribution of\nprotected attributes becomes independent of class labels, making users\nindistinguishable from attribute inference attacks. Specifically, this\ndefensive objective aims to solve a constrained Wasserstein barycenter problem\nto identify the centroid distribution that makes the attribute\nindistinguishable while complying with recommendation performance constraints.\nTo optimize our proposed objective, we use optimal transport to align users\nwith the centroid distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets to evaluate RAID. The experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of RAID and demonstrate its significant superiority over existing\nmethods in multiple aspects.",

They serve as\nhigher-dimensional analogues of Beauville surfaces. Using uniformization, we\noutline the theory to characterize these manifolds through specific\ncombinatorial data associated with the group under the assumption that the\naction is diagonal and the manifold is of general type. This leads to the\nnotion of a $n$-fold Beauville structure. We define an action on the set of all\n$n$-fold Beauville structures of a given finite group that allows us to\ndistinguish the biholomorphism classes of the underlying rigid manifolds. As an\napplication, we give a classification of these manifolds with group $\\mathbb\nZ_5^2$ in the three dimensional case and prove that this is the smallest\npossible group that allows a rigid, free and diagonal action on a product of\nthree curves. In addition, we provide the classification of rigid 3-folds $X$\ngiven by a group acting faithfully on each factor for any value of the\nholomorphic Euler number $\\chi(\\mathcal O_X) \\geq -5$.",

While there\nis ongoing research on enabling camera calibration using natural images, many\nsystems in practice still rely on using designated calibration targets with\ne.g. checkerboard patterns or April tag grids. Once calibration images from\ndifferent perspectives have been acquired and feature descriptors detected,\nthose are typically used in an optimization process to minimize the geometric\nreprojection error. For this optimization to converge, input images need to be\nof sufficient quality and particularly sharpness; they should neither contain\nmotion blur nor rolling-shutter artifacts that can arise when the calibration\nboard was not static during image capture. In this work, we present a novel\ncalibration image acquisition technique controlled via voice commands recorded\nwith a clip-on microphone, that can be more robust and user-friendly than e.g.\ntriggering capture with a remote control, or filtering out blurry frames from a\nvideo sequence in postprocessing. To achieve this, we use a state-of-the-art\nspeech-to-text transcription model with accurate per-word timestamping to\ncapture trigger words with precise temporal alignment.

Intrusive methods can adapt\nto multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods\nrely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable\nbehaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nprompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free\nperspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal\nperturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific\ndistribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes\nas fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is\nderived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between\ndifferent modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt\nwith GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully\ncrafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of\ndatasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger\nduring retrieval queries.

To investigate this effect, we developed a heterogeneous\nworm-like chain model in which the local persistence length follows a Gaussian\ndistribution. We demonstrate that these heterogeneous chains can be effectively\nmapped to homogeneous chains with a single effective persistence length. To\nassess whether this mapping can be extended to naturally occurring IDPs, we\nperformed simulations using various coarse-grained IDP models, finding that the\nsimulated IDPs have similar shapes like the corresponding homogeneous and\nheterogeneous worm-like chains.

In order to reach the EU New Deal goals, new\npolicies to reduce heat energy consumption are indispensable. However, research\ntargeting reductions concentrates either on technical building interventions\nwithout considerations of people's behavior, or psychological interventions\nwith no technical interference. Such interventions can be promising, but their\ntrue potential for scaling up can only be realized by testing approaches that\nintegrate behavioral and technical solutions in tandem rather than in\nisolation. In this research, we study a mix of psychological and technical\ninterventions targeting heating and hot water demand among students in Polish\nuniversity dormitories. We evaluate effects on building energy consumption,\nbehavioral spillovers and on social beliefs and attitudes in a pre-post\nquasi-experimental mixed-method field study in three student dormitories. Our\nfindings reveal that the most effective approaches to yield energy savings were\na direct, collectively framed request to students to reduce thermostat settings\nfor the environment, and an automated technical adjustment of the heating curve\ntemperature. Conversely, interventions targeting domestic hot water had\nunintended effects, including increased energy use and negative spillovers,\nsuch as higher water consumption. Further, we find that informing students\nabout their active, collective participation had a positive impact on perceived\nsocial norms. Our findings highlight the importance of trialing interventions\nin controlled real-world settings to understand the interplay between technical\nsystems, behaviors, and social impacts to enable scalable, evidence-based\npolicies driving an effective and sustainable energy transition.",

    "abstract": "The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models\ncapable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality\ntypically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure\neffective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents\nunique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets\nannotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical\nroad-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce\na novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current\npretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road\nenvironments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D\nobject detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D\ndetection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel\nframework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection\nvia weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing\nconsistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model\nachieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an\nindoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization\ncapabilities of our framework.

    "abstract": "Binary cyclic codes are worth studying due to their applications and\ntheoretical importance. It is an important problem to construct an infinite\nfamily of cyclic codes with large minimum distance $d$ and dual distance\n$d^{\\perp}$. In recent years, much research has been devoted to improving the\nlower bound on $d$, some of which have exceeded the square-root bound. The\nconstructions presented recently seem to indicate that when the minimum\ndistance increases, the minimum distance of its dual code decreases. In this\npaper, we focus on the new constructions of binary cyclic codes with length\n$n=2^m-1$, dimension near $n/2$, and both relatively large minimum distance and\ndual distance. For $m$ is even, we construct a family of binary cyclic codes\nwith parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1}\\pm1,d]$, where $d\\ge 2^{m/2}-1$ and\n$d^\\perp\\ge2^{m/2}$. Both the minimum distance and the dual distance are\nsignificantly better than the previous results. When $m$ is the product of two\ndistinct primes, we construct some cyclic codes with dimensions $k=(n+1)/2$ and\n$d>\\frac{n}{\\log_2n},$ where the lower bound on the minimum distance is much\nlarger than the square-root bound. For $m$ is odd, we present two families of\nbinary $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},d]$ cyclic codes with $d\\ge2^{(m+1)/2}-1$,\n$d^\\perp\\ge2^{(m+1)/2}$ and $d\\ge2^{(m+3)/2}-15$, $d^\\perp\\ge2^{(m-1)/2}$\nrespectively, which leads that $d\\cdot d^\\perp$ can reach $2n$ asymptotically.\nTo the best of our knowledge, except for the punctured binary Reed-Muller\ncodes, there is no other construction of binary cyclic codes that reaches this\nbound.",

Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning\npaths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these\nreasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively\nrefines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is\ndeemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual\nannotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal\ncritique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we\nsystematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To\nobtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an\nannotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared\nancestor node - one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an\nincorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based\nMultimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive\ntraining and inference pipeline.

Direct reward\ncomparison techniques obviate policy learning but suffer from transition\nsparsity, where only a small subset of transitions are sampled due to data\ncollection challenges and feasibility constraints.

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially\nmagnetized nanotubes composed of ultrathin layers with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA). Unlike those with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the stable\nconfigurations of DWs in PMA nanotubes are influenced not only by exchange\ninteractions but also by magnetostatic interactions induced by the radial\ncomponent of magnetization. Particularly, the magnetostatic interactions lead\nto Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects that stabilize chiral\nN\\'{e}el-type DWs. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields\nacting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven\nDW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by\nmicromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to\nmagnetostatic interactions can be as significant as the contribution of\nmaterial-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below $100\\,$nm. This implies\nthat the direction and speed of DW motion in the PMA nanotubes could differ\nfrom those observed in flat nanoribbons composed of the same material.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by\nadjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic\nlayer, rather than relying solely on material-induced DMI. These insights are\nexpected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW\ndevices.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a\nvariety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques. However, these\ntechniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs\nand can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs.\nWhile prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods\nconfront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context\nchanges, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these\nissues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts\n(LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to\npreserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove\nredundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content.\nWe develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the\ncompression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key\ninformation. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external\nblack-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum\nlearning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training\nstrategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the\nDCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information\nintegrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques, especially at higher compression rates.

Recommender systems, which significantly\nshape the content users see and decisions they make, offer an opportunity for\nintervention and regulation.

The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and\ntextual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR\nexhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to\ndisproportionately emphasize either the reference image features\n(visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant\nfusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation\noften fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the\nuser in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a\nnovel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key\ninnovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP\nencoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images,\nsynthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion\nmodel. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced\nintents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune\nall encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the\ntarget image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual\nrepresentations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the\ncomposed feature for retrieval.

Furthermore, in the case of Daphnis,\npronounced vertical wall structures casting shadows on the rings are also\nobserved in the satellite wakes. In this paper, we perform a global 3D N-body\nsimulation with non-zero $e_{\\rm s}$ or non-zero $i_{\\rm s}$ of the satellite\norbit to investigate how they affect the gap edge structures. We found that the\neffect of satellite eccentricity is important both in the satellite wakes and\nthe vertical walls at the gap edges. The non-sinusoidal sawtooth-like satellite\nwakes and azimuthally more localized vertical walls observed by Cassini are\nsimultaneously reproduced in the detailed structures and spatial scales. Both\nof them periodically vary due to the satellite excursions between the apocenter\nand the pericenter. The ring particles in outer (inner) rings that undergo\nclosest encounters with the satellite near the apocenter (pericenter) are\nexcited the most highly. Because the excited eccentricities of the ring\nparticles are converted to the inclinations through physical collisions, the\nconversion is the most active for the particles that acquire the highest\neccentricities, resulting in the azimuthally more localized vertical wall\nstructures. The predicted height of the tallest vertical walls is $\\sim 0.2$\ntimes the satellite Hill radius in the case of the satellite eccentricity\ncomparable to Daphnis when adopting Hill scaling, which is twice as much as the\nheight obtained in the case of the circular satellite orbit and is\nquantitatively more consistent with the Cassini observation. These results show\nthat the observed vertical walls are actually formed by the satellite wakes\nfollowed by their conversion to the vertical motions through inter-particle\ncollisions, rather than by the out-of-plane perturbation from the satellite in\nan inclined orbit.",

In this work, we propose an efficient prompt-tuning framework\ntailored for multi-modal object re-identification, dubbed DMPT, which freezes\nthe main backbone and only optimizes several newly added decoupled\nmodality-aware parameters. Specifically, we explicitly decouple the visual\nprompts into modality-specific prompts which leverage prior modality knowledge\nfrom a powerful text encoder and modality-independent semantic prompts which\nextract semantic information from multi-modal inputs, such as visible,\nnear-infrared, and thermal-infrared. Built upon the extracted features, we\nfurther design a Prompt Inverse Bind (PromptIBind) strategy that employs bind\nprompts as a medium to connect the semantic prompt tokens of different\nmodalities and facilitates the exchange of complementary multi-modal\ninformation, boosting final re-identification results. Experimental results on\nmultiple common benchmarks demonstrate that our DMPT can achieve competitive\nresults to existing state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 6.5%\nfine-tuning of the backbone parameters.",

The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of\nZn(1-x)MgxTe (x<0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro-\nand microstructure using X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic\nresonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the\nnative phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x~0),\nconsidering various Mg-isotopes.",

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new\nclasses from a limited set of training samples without forgetting knowledge of\npreviously learned classes. Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a robust\nfeature extractor during the base training session with abundant training\nsamples and subsequently freeze this extractor, only fine-tuning the classifier\nin subsequent incremental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus\non preventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the relationship\nbetween novel and base classes, without paying attention to the specific\ndecision spaces of each class. To address this challenge, we propose a\nplug-and-play Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatible\nwith most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specific decision boundary\nto each class and adaptively adjust these boundaries during training to\noptimally refine the decision spaces for the classes in each session.\nFurthermore, to amplify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novel\ninter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries and\nprototypes for each class. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely\nCIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS\nmethod with existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves performance,\nachieving overall state-of-the-art results.",

To\naddress this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images\nfrom the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the\ndegradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy\nleverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle\nnoise and enhance target-region brightness.

The core\nidea of AFiRe is to align the anatomical consistency with the unique\ntoken-processing characteristics of Vision Transformer. Specifically, AFiRe\nsynergistically performs two self-supervised schemes: (i) Token-wise\nanatomy-guided contrastive learning, which aligns image tokens based on\nstructural and categorical consistency, thereby enhancing fine-grained\nspatial-anatomical discrimination; (ii) Pixel-level anomaly-removal\nrestoration, which particularly focuses on local anomalies, thereby refining\nthe learned discrimination with detailed geometrical information. Additionally,\nwe propose Synthetic Lesion Mask to enhance anatomical diversity while\npreserving intra-consistency, which is typically corrupted by traditional data\naugmentations, such as Cropping and Affine transformations. Experimental\nresults show that AFiRe: (i) provides robust anatomical discrimination,\nachieving more cohesive feature clusters compared to state-of-the-art\ncontrastive learning methods; (ii) demonstrates superior generalization,\nsurpassing 7 radiography-specific self-supervised methods in multi-label\nclassification tasks with limited labeling; and (iii) integrates fine-grained\ninformation, enabling precise anomaly detection using only image-level\nannotations.",

Current mainstream approaches are based on three\narchitectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in\nefficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing\nlong-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture\nhas demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts\nhave been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly\naddress diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an\nefficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion.\nRestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is\ntailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the\ninitial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract\nshallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined\nmulti-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based\nself-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the\nmodel to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in\nglobal context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature\nrefinement.

Existing\nsolutions use post-hoc smoothing, which fails to bound control derivatives.\nThis paper introduces a new approach: we add a projection filter $\\pi$ to\nminimally correct control samples, ensuring bounds on control magnitude and\nhigher-order derivatives. The filtered samples are then averaged using MPPI,\nleading to our $\\pi$-MPPI approach. We minimize computational overhead by using\na neural accelerated custom optimizer for the projection filter. $\\pi$-MPPI\noffers a simple way to achieve arbitrary smoothness in control sequences.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional urban environment simulation is a powerful tool for\ninformed urban planning. However, the intensive manual effort required to\nprepare input 3D city models has hindered its widespread adoption. To address\nthis challenge, we present VoxCity, an open-source Python package that provides\na one-stop solution for grid-based 3D city model generation and urban\nenvironment simulation for cities worldwide. VoxCity's `generator' subpackage\nautomatically downloads building heights, tree canopy heights, land cover, and\nterrain elevation within a specified target area, and voxelizes buildings,\ntrees, land cover, and terrain to generate an integrated voxel city model. The\n`simulator' subpackage enables users to conduct environmental simulations,\nincluding solar radiation and view index analyses. Users can export the\ngenerated models using several file formats compatible with external software,\nsuch as ENVI-met (INX), Blender, and Rhino (OBJ). We generated 3D city models\nfor eight global cities, and demonstrated the calculation of solar irradiance,\nsky view index, and green view index. We also showcased microclimate simulation\nand 3D rendering visualization through ENVI-met and Rhino, respectively,\nthrough the file export function. Additionally, we reviewed openly available\ngeospatial data to create guidelines to help users choose appropriate data\nsources depending on their target areas and purposes. VoxCity can significantly\nreduce the effort and time required for 3D city model preparation and promote\nthe utilization of urban environment simulations. This contributes to more\ninformed urban and architectural design that considers environmental impacts,\nand in turn, fosters sustainable and livable cities. VoxCity is released openly\nat https://github.com/kunifujiwara/VoxCity.",

    "abstract": "Subgraph counting the task of determining the number of instances of a query\npattern within a large graph lies at the heart of many critical applications,\nfrom analyzing financial networks and transportation systems to understanding\nbiological interactions. Despite decades of work yielding efficient algorithmic\n(AL) solutions and, more recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, a clear\ncomparative understanding is elusive. This gap stems from the absence of a\nunified evaluation framework, standardized datasets, and accessible ground\ntruths, all of which hinder systematic analysis and fair benchmarking. To\novercome these barriers, we introduce BEACON: a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to rigorously evaluate both AL and ML-based subgraph counting methods.\nBEACON provides a standardized dataset with verified ground truths, an\nintegrated evaluation environment, and a public leaderboard, enabling\nreproducible and transparent comparisons across diverse approaches. Our\nextensive experiments reveal that while AL methods excel in efficiently\ncounting subgraphs on very large graphs, they struggle with complex patterns\n(e.g., those exceeding six nodes). In contrast, ML methods are capable of\nhandling larger patterns but demand massive graph data inputs and often yield\nsuboptimal accuracy on small, dense graphs. These insights not only highlight\nthe unique strengths and limitations of each approach but also pave the way for\nfuture advancements in subgraph counting techniques. Overall, BEACON represents\na significant step towards unifying and accelerating research in subgraph\ncounting, encouraging innovative solutions and fostering a deeper understanding\nof the trade-offs between algorithmic and machine learning paradigms.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel approach for the prescription of high order\nboundary conditions when approximating the solution of the Euler equations for\ncompressible gas dynamics on curved moving domains. When dealing with curved\nboundaries, the consistency of boundary conditions is a real challenge, and it\nbecomes even more challenging in the context of moving domains discretized with\nhigh order Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) schemes. The ALE formulation is\nparticularly well-suited for handling moving and deforming domains, thus\nallowing for the simulation of complex fluid-structure interaction problems.\nHowever, if not properly treated, the imposition of boundary conditions can\nlead to significant errors in the numerical solution, which can spoil the high\norder discretization of the underlying mathematical model. In order to tackle\nthis issue, we propose a new method based on the recently developed shifted\nboundary polynomial correction, which was originally proposed on fixed meshes.\nThe new method is integrated into the space-time corrector step of a direct ALE\nfinite volume method to account for the local curvature of the moving boundary\nby only exploiting the high order reconstruction polynomial of the finite\nvolume control volume. It relies on a correction based on the extrapolated\nvalue of the cell polynomial evaluated at the true geometry, thus not requiring\nthe explicit evaluation of high order Taylor series. This greatly simplifies\nthe treatment of moving curved boundaries, as it allows for the use of standard\nsimplicial meshes, which are much easier to generate and move than curvilinear\nones, especially for 3D time-dependent problems. Several numerical experiments\nare presented demonstrating the high order convergence properties of the new\nmethod in the context of compressible flows in moving curved domains, which\nremain approximated by piecewise linear elements.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational tidal interactions drive long-term rotational and orbital\nevolution in planetary systems, in multiple (particularly close binary) star\nsystems and in planetary moon systems. Dissipation of tidal flows in Earth's\noceans is primarily responsible for producing gradual expansion of the Moon's\norbit at a few centimetres per year as the Earth's day lengthens by a few\nmilliseconds per century. Similar processes occur in many astrophysical\nsystems. For example, tidal dissipation inside (slowly rotating) stars hosting\nshort-period planets can cause the orbits of these planets to decay,\npotentially leading to planetary destruction; tidal dissipation inside stars in\nclose stellar binary systems -- and inside short-period planets such as hot\nJupiters in planetary systems -- can cause initially eccentric orbits to become\ncircular. To model these processes, explain many current observational results,\nand make predictions for future observations, we require a detailed theoretical\nunderstanding of tidal flows and the mechanisms by which -- and how efficiently\n-- they are dissipated inside stars and planets. This article will introduce\nour current understanding of tidal flows and dissipation inside stars (and to a\nlesser extent giant planets), as well as highlight some unsolved problems.",

Recent smooth particle\nhydrodynamic simulations involving an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary\nhave shown that a circumbinary disk (CB) can form around the binary and that\nthe presence of dust in the wind of evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars\ncan significantly affect the systemic angular momentum loss and mass accretion\nonto the companion through the wind Roche lobe overflow (WRLOF) phase. We used\nthe binary evolution code BINSTAR, where we updated the modeling of the\nprogenitors of Ba stars including a CB disk, the WRLOF, tidally enhanced wind\nmass loss, and non-conservative RLOF with their effects on the orbital\nevolution. In our approach, we considered that a CB disk forms when WRLOF is\nactivated. The coupling between the CB disk and the binary follows the standard\nresonant interaction theory. We constructed grids of 2.0 + 1.0 $M_\\odot{}$ and\n1.2 + 0.8 $M_\\odot{}$ binaries for initial orbital parameters that result in\nWRLOF, and evolved these systems until the end of the primary's AGB phase.\nWRLOF resulted in a significant shrinkage of the orbital separation during the\nAGB phase, leading to binaries with initial periods on the order of $\\lesssim\n12000$ d undergoing Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). The combination of WRLOF,\neccentricity pumping from the CB disk, and/or tidally enhanced wind mass loss\ncan lead to RLOF on eccentric orbits down to periods of $P_\\mathrm{orb} \\sim\n3000$d. Non-conservative RLOF enabled a reduction of the period before\ncircularization down to $\\sim 2000$d, provided at least 50 percent of the\ntransferred mass left the system. Our models still cannot account for the\neccentricity distribution of Ba stars with periods shorter than $P_\\mathrm{orb}\n\\lesssim 2000$d, where a common envelope evolution appears unavoidable.",

Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational\ncomplexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift\ntowards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing\nEuclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle\ninequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To\naddress this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating\nnon-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory\nrepresentation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic\nspace to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in\nEuclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz\ndistance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints.\nAdditionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly\nintegrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning\npipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh\nfunction to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical\nfoundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that\nintelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across\ndifferent trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for\nmore robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory\nsimilarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world\ndatasets.

However, classical INR methods represent data in\nthe original space mixed with different frequency components, and several\nfeature encoding parameters (e.g., the frequency parameter $\\omega$ or the rank\n$R$) need manual configurations. In this work, we propose a self-evolving\ncross-frequency INR using the Haar wavelet transform (termed CF-INR), which\ndecouples data into four frequency components and employs INRs in the wavelet\nspace. CF-INR allows the characterization of different frequency components\nseparately, thus enabling higher accuracy for data representation. To more\nprecisely characterize cross-frequency components, we propose a cross-frequency\ntensor decomposition paradigm for CF-INR with self-evolving parameters, which\nautomatically updates the rank parameter $R$ and the frequency parameter\n$\\omega$ for each frequency component through self-evolving optimization. This\nself-evolution paradigm eliminates the laborious manual tuning of these\nparameters, and learns a customized cross-frequency feature encoding\nconfiguration for each dataset. We evaluate CF-INR on a variety of visual data\nrepresentation and recovery tasks, including image regression, inpainting,\ndenoising, and cloud removal.

    "abstract": "Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN)\nejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical\ndimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the\ndust location and amount impact observations, we computed\nultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type\nII SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron\nsilicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both\nradioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta\nwith circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year,\napproximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad,\nasymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which\nobscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a\nmore modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts\nof the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as\nSN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be\noptically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order\n1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta\nhas negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In\nnoninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially\nquenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the\nemission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII\nemission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches\nclosely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe\nrequires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple\npower sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.",

    "abstract": "Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized\nrecommendations by interacting with users through conversations. Most existing\nstudies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational\ncontexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational\ncontexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational\ncontexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user\npreference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a\ncertain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling\nstoryline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt\nlearning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image\nfeatures of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture\nhigher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities\n(collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph\nstructures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal\nsemantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language\nmodels to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly\nimproves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and\ncontextually relevant content in response generation.",

Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling\nmulti-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and\ninformation redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment\ndiscovering (AMDNet).

By using learnable span anchors to\ncapture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to\nemphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve\nmore compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment\nmodeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments\nof distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically\nquery-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval\nloss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale\nvideo datasets (\\ie, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority\nand efficiency of our AMDNet.

In this work, we propose the\nRadiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features\nwith data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone.\n  Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and\npatch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and\nperformance in medical image classification.\n  Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into\npatches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused\nwith linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were\nnormalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable\n[CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated\nRE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal\nOCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.

To achieve those promising\ngains, accurate channel state information (CSI) needs to be acquired in BD-RIS\nassisted communication systems. However, the number of coefficients in the\ncascaded channels to be estimated in BD-RIS assisted systems is significantly\nlarger than that in conventional RIS assisted systems, because the channels\nassociated with the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix have to be\nestimated as well. Surprisingly, for the first time in the literature, this\npaper rigorously shows that the uplink channel estimation overhead in BD-RIS\nassisted systems is actually of the same order as that in the conventional RIS\nassisted systems. This amazing result stems from a key observation: for each\nuser antenna, its cascaded channel matrix associated with one reference BD-RIS\nelement is a scaled version of that associated with any other BD-RIS element\ndue to the common RIS-base station (BS) channel. In other words, the number of\nindependent unknown variables is far less than it would seem at first glance.\nBuilding upon this property, this paper manages to characterize the minimum\noverhead to perfectly estimate all the channels in the ideal case without noise\nat the BS, and propose a twophase estimation framework for the practical case\nwith noise at the BS.

Here, we introduce a novel\nframework for studying repeated multi-player interactions in structured\npopulations -- repeated multi-player games on hypergraphs -- where multiple\nindividuals within each hyperedge engage in a repeated game, and each player\ncan simultaneously participate in many games. We focus on public goods games,\nwhere individuals differ in their initial endowments, their allocation of\nendowments across games, and their productivity, which determines the impact of\ntheir contributions. Through Nash equilibrium analysis, we reveal the intricate\ninterplay between full cooperation (all individuals contribute their entire\nendowments, maximizing collective benefits) and key factors such as initial\nendowments, productivity, contribution strategies, and interaction structure.\nNotably, while equal endowments are most effective in promoting full\ncooperation in homogeneous hypergraphs, they can hinder cooperation in\nheterogeneous hypergraphs, suggesting that equal endowments are not universally\noptimal. To address this, we propose two optimization strategies: one for\npolicymakers to adjust endowment distributions and another for players to\nmodify their contribution strategies.

While some\nstudies report absence of the X-ray shallow decay for hyper-energetic GRBs,\nrecently discovered GRB 240529A shows a clear shallow decay phase with an\nisotropic gamma-ray energy of \\SI{2.2e54}{erg}, making it a highly unusual case\ncompared to typical GRBs. In order to investigate the physical mechanism of the\nshallow decay, we perform the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT analysis of GRB 240529A along\nwith \\textit{Swift}-XRT analysis. We find no jet break feature in the X-ray\nlight curve and then give the lower bound of the collimation-corrected jet\nenergy of $>10^{52}$~erg, which is close to the maximum rotational energy of a\nmagnetar. Our LAT data analysis reveals evidence of GeV emission with a\nstatistical significance of $4.5\\sigma$ during the shallow decay phase, which\ncan be interpreted as the first case for hyper-energetic GRBs with a typical\nshallow decay phase. The GeV to keV flux ratio is calculated to be $4.2\\pm2.3$.\nTogether with X-ray spectral index, this indicates an inverse Compton origin of\nthe GeV emission. Multiwavelength modeling based on time-dependent simulations\ntested two promising models, the energy injection and wind models.

    "abstract": "The ability of cross-lingual context retrieval is a fundamental aspect of\ncross-lingual alignment of large language models (LLMs), where the model\nextracts context information in one language based on requests in another\nlanguage. Despite its importance in real-life applications, this ability has\nnot been adequately investigated for state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we\nevaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval ability of over 40 LLMs across 12\nlanguages to understand the source of this ability, using cross-lingual machine\nreading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show\nthat several small, post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context\nretrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their\nestimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our\ninterpretability analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval\nprocess can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer\nretrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training, respectively.\nThe phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck\nlies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of\npost-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that\nlarger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance. Instead, larger\nLLMs need further multilingual post-training to fully unlock their\ncross-lingual context retrieval potential.

These patches were initially\ndesigned to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have\nrecently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors.\nHowever, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack\neffectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose\nCDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object\ndetectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that\ncolor variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in\ntemperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we\npropose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches,\nenabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal\ncolor distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal\nresponse and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we\nintroduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared\ndataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and\nperspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our\npatch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g.,\nDroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms\nexisting patch attacks in the digital domain.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently gained state of the art performance on many\nimage generation tasks. However, most models require significant computational\nresources to achieve this. This becomes apparent in the application of medical\nimage synthesis due to the 3D nature of medical datasets like CT-scans, MRIs,\nelectron microscope, etc. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for a\nsingle GPU memory-efficient training for diffusion models for high dimensional\nmedical datasets. The proposed model is built by using an invertible UNet\narchitecture with invertible attention modules. This leads to the following two\ncontributions: 1. denoising diffusion models and thus enabling memory usage to\nbe independent of the dimensionality of the dataset, and 2. reducing the energy\nusage during training. While this new model can be applied to a multitude of\nimage generation tasks, we showcase its memory-efficiency on the 3D BraTS2020\ndataset leading to up to 15\\% decrease in peak memory consumption during\ntraining with comparable results to SOTA while maintaining the image quality.",

    "abstract": "The ability to localize transmission loss change to a subset of links in\noptical networks is crucial for maintaining network reliability, performance\nand security. \\emph{Quantum probes}, implemented by sending blocks of $n$\ncoherent-state pulses augmented with continuous-variable (CV) squeezing ($n=1$)\nor weak temporal-mode entanglement ($n>1$) over a lossy channel to a receiver\nwith homodyne detection capabilities, are known to be more sensitive than their\nquasi-classical counterparts in detecting a sudden increase in channel loss.\nThe enhanced sensitivity can be characterized by the increased Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence of the homodyne output, before and after the loss change\noccurs. When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the\nincrease in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency.\n  In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, generalizing\nprevious results on $n=1$ (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of $n$.\nAssuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and\nreceiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching\ncapabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have\nsuffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their\nsensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe\nconstruction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss\nchange identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses.\nWe then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule,\nwhich allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the lossy links\nusing our constructed probes. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme\nachieves a quantum speedup in decreasing the detection delay.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous reporting system databases are key resources for post-marketing\nsurveillance, providing real-world evidence (RWE) on the adverse events (AEs)\nof regulated drugs or other medical products. Various statistical methods have\nbeen proposed for AE signal detection in these databases, flagging\ndrug-specific AEs with disproportionately high observed counts compared to\nexpected counts under independence. However, signal detection remains\nchallenging for rare AEs or newer drugs, which receive small observed and\nexpected counts and thus suffer from reduced statistical power. Principled\ninformation sharing on signal strengths across drugs/AEs is crucial in such\ncases to enhance signal detection. However, existing methods typically ignore\ncomplex between-drug associations on AE signal strengths, limiting their\nability to detect signals. We propose novel local-global mixture Dirichlet\nprocess (DP) prior-based nonparametric Bayesian models to capture these\nassociations, enabling principled information sharing between drugs while\nbalancing flexibility and shrinkage for each drug, thereby enhancing\nstatistical power. We develop efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for\nimplementation and employ a false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled, false\nnegative rate (FNR)-optimized hypothesis testing framework for AE signal\ndetection. Extensive simulations demonstrate our methods' superior sensitivity\n-- often surpassing existing approaches by a twofold or greater margin -- while\nstrictly controlling the FDR. An application to FDA FAERS data on statin drugs\nfurther highlights our methods' effectiveness in real-world AE signal\ndetection.

Existing models predominantly rely on\n2D object detection, which fails to capture the complexities of real-world\nviolations due to: (i) an oversimplified task formulation treating violation\nrecognition merely as object detection, (ii) inadequate validation under\nrealistic conditions, (iii) absence of standardized baselines, and (iv) limited\nscalability from the unavailability of synthetic dataset generators for diverse\nconstruction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce\nSafe-Construct, the first framework that reformulates violation recognition as\na 3D multi-view engagement task, leveraging scene-level worker-object context\nand 3D spatial understanding. We also propose the Synthetic Indoor Construction\nSite Generator (SICSG) to create diverse, scalable training data, overcoming\ndata limitations. Safe-Construct achieves a 7.6% improvement over\nstate-of-the-art methods across four violation types. We rigorously evaluate\nour approach in near-realistic settings, incorporating four violations, four\nworkers, 14 objects, and challenging conditions like occlusions (worker-object,\nworker-worker) and variable illumination (back-lighting, overexposure,\nsunlight).

    "abstract": "The thickness of a galaxy's disk provides a valuable probe of its formation\nand evolution history. Observations of the Milky Way and local galaxies have\nrevealed an ubiquitous disk structure with two distinctive components: an old\nthick disk and a relatively young thin disk. The formation of this dual-disk\nstructure and the mechanisms that develop the thickness of the disk are still\nunclear. Whether the disk thickness inherit from the birth environment or is\nestablished through secular dynamical heating after formation is under debate.\nIn this work we identify a relatively young ($\\sim$6.6 billion years old)\ngeometric thick disk in the Milky Way, with a scale height of $0.64$ kpc at the\nSolar Circle. This young thick component exhibits comparable thickness and\nflaring strength to the canonical old thick disk but is more radially extended\nand systematically younger. We also identify thin disk components that formed\nbefore and after this young thick disk. Detailed analysis of the solar vicinity\nstructure suggests that the young thick disk marks the onset of a new phase of\nupside-down disk formation. These findings strongly discount the role of\nsecular dynamical heating and support a turbulent, bursty birth environment as\nthe primary mechanism behind thick disk formation. The existence of two thick\ndisk components suggests that the Milky Way has undergone at least two episodes\nof turbulent and bursty star formation, likely triggered by galaxy mergers.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that Euclidean Giddings-Strominger axion\nwormholes are stable in asymptotically flat 4D Minkowski spacetime, suggesting\nthat they should, at least naively, be included as contributions in the quantum\ngravitational path integral. Such inclusion appears to lead to known wormhole\nparadoxes, such as the factorization problem. In this paper, we generalize\nthese results to AdS3 spacetime, where the axion is equivalent to a U(1) gauge\nfield. We explicitly construct the classical wormhole solutions, show their\nregularity and stability, and compute their actions for arbitrary ratios of the\nwormhole mouth radius to the AdS radius and across various topologies. Finally,\nWe discuss potential implications of these findings for the 3D gravitational\npath integral.",

The branching fraction of the\ndecay is measured for the first time to be $\\mathcal{B}(D^0\\rightarrow\n\\bar{K}^0\\pi^-\\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}) = (1.373 \\pm 0.020_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.023_{\\rm\nsyst})\\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is\nsystematic. Based on the investigation of the decay dynamics, we find that the\ndecay is dominated by the $K^{*}(892)^-$ resonance with the branching fraction\nmeasured to be $\\mathcal{B}(D^0\\rightarrow K^{*}(892)^-\\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}) = (1.948\n\\pm 0.033_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.036_{\\rm syst})\\%$.

The $A_1(0)$ is measured for the first time in $D^0\\rightarrow\nK^{*}(892)^-\\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}$ decay. Averaging the form-factor parameters that we\nreported previously in $D^0\\rightarrow K^*(892)^-(\\rightarrow\n\\bar{K}^0\\pi^-)e^+\\nu_{e}$ and $D^0\\rightarrow K^*(892)^-(\\rightarrow\nK^-\\pi^0)\\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}$ decays, we obtain $r_{V}=1.456\\pm0.040_{\\rm\nstat}\\pm0.016_{\\rm syst}$, $r_{2}=0.715\\pm0.031_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.014_{\\rm stat}$,\nand $A_1(0)=0.614\\pm0.005_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.004_{\\rm syst}$.

A paradigmatic model for such materials that captures both kinds of\ninteractions is the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model with a\ndispersionless Einstein phonon. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of\nthe magnetic, density, and superconducting fluctuations at and away from\nhalf-filling. To that end, we employ the functional renormalization group using\nthe recently introduced extension of the single-boson exchange formulation.\nMore precisely, we go beyond previous approaches to the model by resolving the\nfull frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and taking into account\nthe feedback from the electronic self-energy. We perform broad parameter scans\nin the space of Hubbard repulsion, electron-phonon coupling strength, and\nphonon frequency to explore the leading magnetic, density, and superconducting\nsusceptibilities from the adiabatic to the anti-adiabatic regime. Our numerical\ndata reveal that self-energy effects lead to an enhancement of the $d$-wave\nsuperconducting susceptibility towards larger phonon frequencies, in contrast\nto earlier isotope-effect studies. At small phonon frequencies, large density\ncontributions to the $s$-wave superconducting susceptibility change sign and\neventually lead to a reduction of $s$-wave superconductivity with increasing\nelectron-phonon coupling, signaling the breakdown of Migdal-Eliashberg theory.\nWe analyze our findings systematically, employing detailed diagnostics of the\nintertwined fluctuations and pinning down the various positive and negative\nisotope effects of the physical susceptibilities.",

If the\ncoefficients of quasar's luminosity relation vary with redshift, it could\nintroduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this\npaper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray\nluminosity and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($L_\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\mathrm{UV}$)\nrelations of quasars. For the standard $L_\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\mathrm{UV}$ relation,\nwe find that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation\nwith redshift, which is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally,\nwe examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving\n$L_\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\mathrm{UV}$ relations and find that the inclusion of a\nredshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, as\nthe relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we\nconstruct a new $L_\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\mathrm{UV}$ relation in which the redshift\nevolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. Calibrating the\nluminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that\nquasars utilizing our new relation yield effective constraints on cosmological\nparameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike\nconstraints derived from the standard relation.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have been widely adopted to guide vision\nfoundation models in performing reasoning segmentation tasks, achieving\nimpressive performance. However, the substantial computational overhead\nassociated with LVLMs presents a new challenge. The primary source of this\ncomputational cost arises from processing hundreds of image tokens. Therefore,\nan effective strategy to mitigate such overhead is to reduce the number of\nimage tokens, a process known as image token pruning. Previous studies on image\ntoken pruning for LVLMs have primarily focused on high level visual\nunderstanding tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. In\ncontrast, guiding vision foundation models to generate accurate visual masks\nbased on textual queries demands precise semantic and spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. Consequently, pruning methods must carefully control individual\nimage tokens throughout the LVLM reasoning process. Our empirical analysis\nreveals that existing methods struggle to adequately balance reductions in\ncomputational overhead with the necessity to maintain high segmentation\naccuracy. In this work, we propose LVLM_CSP, a novel training free visual token\npruning method specifically designed for LVLM based reasoning segmentation\ntasks. LVLM_CSP consists of three stages: clustering, scattering, and pruning.\nInitially, the LVLM performs coarse-grained visual reasoning using a subset of\nselected image tokens. Next, fine grained reasoning is conducted, and finally,\nmost visual tokens are pruned in the last stage. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that LVLM_CSP achieves a 65% reduction in image token inference\nFLOPs with virtually no accuracy degradation, and a 70% reduction with only a\nminor 1% drop in accuracy on the 7B LVLM.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking for diffusion images has drawn considerable attention due to the\nwidespread use of text-to-image diffusion models and the increasing need for\ntheir copyright protection. Recently, advanced watermarking techniques, such as\nTree Ring, integrate watermarks by embedding traceable patterns (e.g., Rings)\ninto the latent distribution during the diffusion process. Such methods disrupt\nthe original semantics of the generated images due to the inevitable\ndistribution shift caused by the watermarks, thereby limiting their\npracticality, particularly in digital art creation. In this work, we present\nSemantic-aware Pivotal Tuning Watermarks (PT-Mark), a novel invisible\nwatermarking method that preserves both the semantics of diffusion images and\nthe traceability of the watermark. PT-Mark preserves the original semantics of\nthe watermarked image by gradually aligning the generation trajectory with the\noriginal (pivotal) trajectory while maintaining the traceable watermarks during\nwhole diffusion denoising process. To achieve this, we first compute the\nsalient regions of the watermark at each diffusion denoising step as a spatial\nprior to identify areas that can be aligned without disrupting the watermark\npattern. Guided by the region, we then introduce an additional pivotal tuning\nbranch that optimizes the text embedding to align the semantics while\npreserving the watermarks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PT-Mark can\npreserve the original semantics of the diffusion images while integrating\nrobust watermarks. It achieves a 10% improvement in the performance of semantic\npreservation (i.e., SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art\nwatermarking methods, while also showing comparable robustness against\nreal-world perturbations and four times greater efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Wetlands constitute critical ecosystems that support both biodiversity and\nhuman well-being; however, they have experienced a significant decline since\nthe 20th century. Back in the 1970s, researchers began to employ remote sensing\ntechnologies for wetland classification and mapping to elucidate the extent and\nvariations of wetlands. Although some review articles summarized the\ndevelopment of this field, there is a lack of a thorough and in-depth\nunderstanding of wetland classification and mapping: (1) the scientific\nimportance of wetlands, (2) major data, methods used in wetland classification\nand mapping, (3) driving factors of wetland changes, (4) current research\nparadigm and limitations, (5) challenges and opportunities in wetland\nclassification and mapping under the context of technological innovation and\nglobal environmental change. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive\nperspective and new insights into wetland classification and mapping for\nreaders to answer these questions. First, we conduct a meta-analysis of over\n1,200 papers, encompassing wetland types, methods, sensor types, and study\nsites, examining prevailing trends in wetland classification and mapping. Next,\nwe review and synthesize the wetland features and existing data and methods in\nwetland classification and mapping. We also summarize typical wetland mapping\nproducts and explore the intrinsic driving factors of wetland changes across\nmultiple spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we discuss current limitations\nand propose future directions in response to global environmental change and\ntechnological innovation. This review consolidates our understanding of wetland\nremote sensing and offers scientific recommendations that foster transformative\nprogress in wetland science.",

However,\nat this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic,\nleaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic\nordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry\nwould correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode.\nHere, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced\nB$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a\nCurie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is\nclose to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is\nresponsible for the transition. Since prior Raman measurements have shown\nminimal softening of the B$_{2g}$ optical mode as well, our finding strengthens\nthe case that the transition is largely excitonic in nature.

To address these challenges, this paper develops an\ninterference-suppressed and cost-efficient cell-free ISAC network, which\nopportunistically and cooperatively orchestrates distributed radio resources to\naccommodate the competing demands of sensing and communication (S\\&C) services.\nSpecifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that\nautonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space\nto safeguard other networks without exchanging channel knowledge signaling.\nThen, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to\ndynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for\nservice provisioning.

    "abstract": "Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually\nappealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints.\nWhile recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results,\nthey typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive\nfine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability.\nAlternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning\nwith Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from\nlimited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which\nrestrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this\nend, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms\nlayout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for\nprocessing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective\nretrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout,\ntogether with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT\nreasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both\nsemantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT\nreasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep\nreasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as\ndeepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the stability and large-time behavior of solutions to\nthe rotating Boussinesq system under the influence of a general gravitational\npotential $\\Psi$, which is widely used to model the dynamics of stratified\ngeophysical fluids on the $f-$plane. Our main results are threefold: First, by\nimposing physically realistic boundary conditions and viscosity constraints, we\nprove that the solutions of the system smust necessarily take the following\nsteady-state form $(\\rho,u,v,w,p)=(\\rho_s,0,v_s,0, p_s)$. These solutions are\ncharacterized by both geostrophic balance, given by $fv_s-\\frac{\\partial\np_s}{\\partial x}=\\rho_s\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x}$ and hydrostatic\nbalance, expressed as $-\\frac{\\partial p_s}{\\partial z}=\\rho_s\\frac{\\partial\n\\Psi}{\\partial z}$. Second, we establish that any steady-state solution\nsatisfying the conditions $\\nabla \\rho_s=\\delta (x,z)\\nabla \\Psi$ with\n$v_s(x,z)=a_0x+a_1$ is linearly unstable when the conditions\n$\\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}>0$ and $(f+\\alpha_0)\\leq 0$ are simultaneously\nsatisfied. This instability under the condition $\\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}>0$\ncorresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Third, although the\ninherent Rayleigh-Taylor instability could potentially amplify the velocity\naround unstable steady-state solutions (heavier density over lighter one), we\nrigorously demonstrate that for any sufficiently smooth initial data, the\nsolutions of the system asymptotically converge to a neighborhood of a\nsteady-state solution in which both the zonal and vertical velocity components\nvanish. Finally, under a moderate additional assumption, we demonstrate that\nthe system converges to a specific steady-state solution. In this state, the\ndensity profile is given by $\\rho=-\\gamma \\Psi+\\beta$, where $\\gamma$ and\n$\\beta$ are positive constants, and the meridional velocity $v$ depends solely\nand linearly on $x$ variable.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for controllable video diffusion,\nOmniVDiff, aiming to synthesize and comprehend multiple video visual content in\na single diffusion model. To achieve this, OmniVDiff treats all video visual\nmodalities in the color space to learn a joint distribution, while employing an\nadaptive control strategy that dynamically adjusts the role of each visual\nmodality during the diffusion process, either as a generation modality or a\nconditioning modality. This allows flexible manipulation of each modality's\nrole, enabling support for a wide range of tasks. Consequently, our model\nsupports three key functionalities: (1) Text-conditioned video generation:\nmulti-modal visual video sequences (i.e., rgb, depth, canny, segmentaion) are\ngenerated based on the text conditions in one diffusion process; (2) Video\nunderstanding: OmniVDiff can estimate the depth, canny map, and semantic\nsegmentation across the input rgb frames while ensuring coherence with the rgb\ninput; and (3) X-conditioned video generation: OmniVDiff generates videos\nconditioned on fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth maps or segmentation maps).\nBy integrating these diverse tasks into a unified video diffusion framework,\nOmniVDiff enhances the flexibility and scalability for controllable video\ndiffusion, making it an effective tool for a variety of downstream\napplications, such as video-to-video translation.

This work aims to convert sign\nlanguage video footage into static illustrations, which serve as an additional\neducational resource to complement video content. This process is usually done\nby an artist, and is therefore quite costly. We propose a method that\nillustrates sign language videos by leveraging generative models' ability to\nunderstand both the semantic and geometric aspects of images. Our approach\nfocuses on transferring a sketch like illustration style to video footage of\nsign language, combining the start and end frames of a sign into a single\nillustration, and using arrows to highlight the hand's direction and motion.\nWhile many style transfer methods address domain adaptation at varying levels\nof abstraction, applying a sketch like style to sign languages, especially for\nhand gestures and facial expressions, poses a significant challenge. To tackle\nthis, we intervene in the denoising process of a diffusion model, injecting\nstyle as keys and values into high resolution attention layers, and fusing\ngeometric information from the image and edges as queries.

While effective, dense retrieval produces uninterpretable dense\nvectors, and suffers from the drawback of large index size. Learned sparse\nretrieval (LSR) has emerged as promising alternative, achieving competitive\nretrieval performance while also being able to leverage the classical inverted\nindex data structure for efficient retrieval. However, limited works have\nexplored scaling LSR beyond BERT scale. In this work, we identify two\nchallenges in training large language models (LLM) for LSR: (1) training\ninstability during the early stage of contrastive training; (2) suboptimal\nperformance due to pre-trained LLM's unidirectional attention. To address these\nchallenges, we propose two corresponding techniques: (1) a lightweight\nadaptation training phase to eliminate training instability; (2) two model\nvariants to enable bidirectional information. With these techniques, we are\nable to train LSR models with 8B scale LLM, and achieve competitive retrieval\nperformance with reduced index size. Furthermore, we are among the first to\nanalyze the performance-efficiency tradeoff of LLM-based LSR model through the\nlens of model quantization. Our findings provide insights into adapting LLMs\nfor efficient retrieval modeling.",

There are\nseveral instances of each methodology in the literature, with the goal of\npredicting data races using a streaming algorithm where the required memory\ndoes not grow proportional to the length of the observed run, but these\ninstances were mostly created in an ad hoc manner, without much attention to\ntheir unifying underlying principles. In this paper, we identify and formalize\nthese principles for each category with the ultimate goal of paving the way for\ncombining them into a new algorithm which shares their efficiency\ncharacteristics but offers strictly more prediction power. In particular, we\nformalize three distinct classes of races predictable using commutativity\nreasoning, and compare them. We identify three different styles of prefix\nreasoning, and prove that they predict the same class of races, which provably\ncontains all races predictable by any commutativity reasoning technique.\n  Our key contribution is combining prefix reasoning and commutativity\nreasoning in a modular way to introduce a new class of races, granular prefix\nraces, that are predictable in constant-space and linear time, in a streaming\nfashion. This class of races includes all races predictable using commutativity\nand prefix reasoning techniques. We present an improved constant-space\nalgorithm for prefix reasoning alone based on the idea of antichains (from\nlanguage theory).

Adding feedback conditioned\non the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition\nwitnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These\ntransitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur\nwithin the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by\nclassical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical\nlimit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these\ntransitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined\nclassical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the\nabsorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase\ntransition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes\ndiscontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the\ncontrol transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which\ncarry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations\n(present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories\nand states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be\nestimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit\nfluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the\nclassical limit.

We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and\nfermionic representations. In the fermionic representation, the central charge\non each null ray is positive, for bosons it is negative. A negative central\ncharge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In the model,\nthere is a natural $SU(1,1)$ Casimir. For the bosonic representations, the\n$SU(1,1)$ Casimir can have either sign. For the fermionic representations, the\n$SU(1,1)$ Casimir is always greater or equal to zero. To exclude negative norm\nstates, we restrict ourselves to the fermionic case. To understand the physical\nimplications of this restriction, we express the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir in terms of\nthe geometric data. In this way, the positivity bound on the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir\ntranslates into an upper bound for the shear of each null generator. In the\nmodel, this bound must be satisfied for all three-dimensional null\nhypersurfaces. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in\nan asymptotically flat spacetime. In this way, we obtain a bound on the\nradiated power of gravitational waves in the model.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in\nthe pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in\nfault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM\napproach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape\nthe measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified\nbit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement\nresults, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each\ncluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy\ndistribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bit-flip error\nrates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can\nmitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise\nmodel. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To\naddress the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise\nchannels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees\nregressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector\nconsisting of machine calibration data (gate & measurement error rates),\ncircuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.)\nand the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results\nshow that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of\n1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set\nof low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines. Our approach\noutperforms the state-of-art QEM approaches M3 [24], Hammer [35], and QBEEP\n[33] by 1.29x, 1.47x, and 2.65x, respectively.",

We propose an infinite class of product programs,\nspecifically designed with recursion in mind, that reduce the hypersafety\nverification of a recursive program to standard safety verification. For this,\nwe combine insights from language theory and concurrency theory to propose an\nalgorithmic solution for constructing an infinite class of recursive product\nprograms. One key insight is that, using the simple theory of visibly pushdown\nlanguages, one can maintain the recursive structure of syntactic program\nalignments which is vital to constructing a new product program that can be\nviewed as a classic recursive program -- that is, one that can be executed on a\nsingle stack. Another key insight is that techniques from concurrency theory\ncan be generalized to help define product programs based on the view that the\nparallel composition of individual recursive programs includes all possible\nalignments from which a sound set of alignments that faithfully preserve the\nsatisfaction of the hypersafety property can be selected. On the practical\nside, we formulate a family of parametric canonical product constructions that\nare intuitive to programmers and can be used as building blocks to specify\nrecursive product programs for the purpose of relational and hypersafety\nverification, with the idea that the right product program can be verified\nautomatically using existing techniques.

    "abstract": "Across cultures, names tell a lot about their bearers as they carry deep\npersonal and cultural significance. Names also serve as powerful signals of\ngender, race, and status in the social hierarchy - a pecking order in which\nindividual positions shape others' expectations on their perceived competence\nand worth. With the widespread adoption of LLMs and as names are often an input\nfor LLMs, it is crucial to evaluate whether LLMs may sort people into status\npositions based on first and last names and, if so, whether it is in an unfair,\nbiased fashion. While prior work has primarily investigated biases in first\nnames, little attention has been paid to last names and even less to the\ncombined effects of first and last names. In this study, we conduct a\nlarge-scale analysis of name variations across 5 ethnicities to examine how AI\nexhibits name biases. Our study investigates three key characteristics of\ninequality and finds that LLMs reflect and reinforce status hierarchies based\non names that signal gender and ethnicity as they encode differential\nexpectations of competence, leadership, and economic potential. Contrary to the\ncommon assumption that AI tends to favor Whites, we show that East and, in some\ncontexts, South Asian names receive higher rankings. We also disaggregate\nAsians, a population projected to be the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by\n2055. Our results challenge the monolithic Asian model minority assumption,\nillustrating a more complex and stratified model of bias. Gender moderates\nbiases, with girls facing unfair disadvantages in certain racial groups.\nAdditionally, spanning cultural categories by adopting Western first names\nimproves AI-perceived status for East and Southeast Asian students,\nparticularly for girls.

We\nintroduce wavelet transforms to effectively extend convolutional receptive\nfields and guide CNNs to better respond to low frequencies through cascading,\ntermed wavelet convolution. Each convolution focuses on different frequency\nbands of the input signal with gradually increasing effective ranges.

    "abstract": "B-spline modeling is fundamental to CAD systems, and its evaluation and\nmanipulation algorithms currently in use were developed decades ago,\nspecifically for CPU architectures. While remaining effective for many\napplications, these algorithms become increasingly inadequate as CAD models\ngrow more complex, such as large-scale assemblies and microstructures. GPU\nacceleration offers a promising solution, but most existing GPU B-spline\nalgorithms simply adapt CPU counterparts without accounting for the mismatch\nbetween the unstructured, recursive nature of B-splines and the structured\nnature of GPU kernels, ultimately failing to fully leverage GPU capabilities.\nThis paper presents a novel approach that transforms B-spline representations\ninto regular matrix structures, reducing all evaluation and manipulation\ncomputations to matrix addition and multiplication, thus better aligning with\nGPU architecture. By combining this matrix representation with GPU-optimized\ntask scheduling and memory access patterns, the paper demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements in the key B-spline operations of inversion and\nprojection. Experimental results show an improvement of about two orders of\nmagnitude in computational speed compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "A novel population-based heuristic algorithm called the adaptive and various\nlearning-based algorithm (AVLA) is proposed for solving general optimization\nproblems in this paper. The main idea of AVLA is inspired by the learning\nbehaviors of individuals in a group, e.g. a school class. The algorithm\nformulates the following learning behaviors: a. Elite members will learn from\neach other; b. A common member will learn from some elite member and other\ncommon members; c. Members with unsatisfied performance will reflect their\nbehavior after performance estimation; d. The whole group will reflect their\nbehavior and try to improve if the performance of the group as a whole has not\nbeen improved for a long time. AVLA adopts the success-history based parameter\nadaptation to lighten the burden of parameter adjustment. To verify the\nefficiency of the AVLA, we apply it and its no-adaptation version with other\neight well-known heuristics to 100 benchmark problems. The comparison clearly\nshows that AVLA performs as well as SHADE and the non-adaption version of AVLA\noutperforms others except AVLA and SHADE.",

For another\nobservation, the lag-frequency spectra are characterised by small positive or\nzero time lags at the lowest frequencies, which drops to negative values at\nhigher frequencies. The magnitude of the soft lags ranges from $\\sim5$ to\n$\\sim40$ minutes, and increases with the energy difference of two compared LCs.\nThe observed X-ray spectra and lag-frequency spectra can both be successfully\ndescribed by our proposed two-zone model, with the physical parameters\nconstrained in a fully acceptable space. Moreover, the LC profiles at different\nenergy bands can be satisfactorily reproduced by only varying the injection\nrate of the energetic electrons. The IDV of PKS 2155-304 should be caused by\nthe injection of energetic electrons, and accelerated by shocks formed in a\nweakly magnetised jet.",

It is so far a challenging task to capture simultaneously the 3D\nstructure and molecular orientation in a single frame of far-field intensity\ndistribution, within the timescale of rapid-happened spatial organization\nevents of bio-complexes. We report an optical imaging method called pSIDH, to\nencode multidimensional sample information includes 3D structures and dipole\norientations, in their far-field fluorescence-self-interference pattern. The\ncomputational reconstruction from the holographic extracted complex-valued\nlight field provides optical-aberration-corrected 3D polarization images of the\nsample. In pSIDH microscope incorporating planar liquid crystal lens and high\nnumerical aperture objective, we demonstrate scanning-free 3D volumetric\npolarization imaging of fluorescently-labelled sample, with simultaneously\ncomputational-improved system measuring accuracy on the 3D spatial and\npolarization dimensions. The pSIDH imaging on phalloidin-fluorophore labelling\nU2OS cells provides rapid tools of capturing simultaneous the 3D structural\ndetails and spatial-averaged molecular orientation distributions of biological\ncomplex architectures such as actin filaments.",

The algorithm's fragility arises from the\nrequirement that, to solve an n qubit problem, one must fault-tolerantly sample\nO(n) linearly independent values from a solution space. In this paper, we study\nan adiabatic implementation of Simon's algorithm that requires a constant\nnumber of successful samples regardless of problem size. We implement this\nalgorithm on D-Wave hardware and solve problems with up to 298 qubits. We\ncompare the runtime of classical algorithms to the D-Wave solution to analyze\nany potential advantage.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the growing need for black-box optimization and data privacy, we\nintroduce a collaborative Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that addresses\nboth of these challenges. In this framework agents work collaboratively to\noptimize a function they only have oracle access to. In order to mitigate\nagainst communication and privacy constraints, agents are not allowed to share\ntheir data but can share their Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models. To\nenable collaboration under these constraints, we construct a central model to\napproximate the objective function by leveraging the concept of Wasserstein\nbarycenters of GPs. This central model integrates the shared models without\naccessing the underlying data. A key aspect of our approach is a collaborative\nacquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation, allowing for\nthe optimization of decision variables collaboratively in each iteration. We\nprove that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically consistent and that its\nimplementation via Monte Carlo methods is numerically accurate. Through\nnumerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other\nbaseline collaborative frameworks and is competitive with centralized\napproaches that do not consider data privacy.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the thin-slicing approach - the ability to make accurate\njudgments based on minimal information - in the context of scientific\npresentations. Drawing on research from nonverbal communication and personality\npsychology, we show that brief excerpts (thin slices) reliably predict overall\npresentation quality. Using a novel corpus of over one hundred real-life\nscience talks, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate transcripts\nof full presentations and their thin slices. By correlating LLM-based\nevaluations of short excerpts with full-talk assessments, we determine how much\ninformation is needed for accurate predictions. Our results demonstrate that\nLLM-based evaluations align closely with human ratings, proving their validity,\nreliability, and efficiency. Critically, even very short excerpts (less than 10\npercent of a talk) strongly predict overall evaluations. This suggests that the\nfirst moments of a presentation convey relevant information that is used in\nquality evaluations and can shape lasting impressions. The findings are robust\nacross different LLMs and prompting strategies. This work extends thin-slicing\nresearch to public speaking and connects theories of impression formation to\nLLMs and current research on AI communication. We discuss implications for\ncommunication and social cognition research on message reception. Lastly, we\nsuggest an LLM-based thin-slicing framework as a scalable feedback tool to\nenhance human communication.",
