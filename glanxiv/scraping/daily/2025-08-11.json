The high-order (HO) system evolves particles in a manner\nthat conserves charge, energy, and canonical momentum, while the low-order (LO)\nsystem solves the fluid moment and Darwin equations, acting as an algorithmic\nconvergence accelerator to the HO system. We demonstrate the HOLO method's\nability to take timesteps far larger than the explicit limit, and accurately\nrecover the system's evolution so long as its dynamical timescale is respected.\nAlso, we find that the choice of LO fluid moment equations has a strong impact\non the nonlinear convergence of the coupled particle-field system.

Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating\nrealistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major\nchallenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches\nfrequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,\nmulti-dimensional evaluation frameworks.\n  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art\nopen-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by\nstructured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from\nexample-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and\ndomain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework\nfeatures a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated\ndata across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy\npreservation.\n  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,\nCirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt\nengineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with\nrule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM\nestablishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with\nrobust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is\nboth clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more\neffective data sharing in healthcare research.",

However, the domain of game-playing poses\na particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large\nstate space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of\nthe policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal\npatterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this\nmatrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the\nhighest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE\nwith CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input\nstate, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT.

By crafting universal steering images that induce target\nactivation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving\nmodalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual\ninstructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment\ntasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image\nmatches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts\nwhile dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%\nshifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike\nsystem prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control\nwhile maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks.

    "abstract": "The inherently nonlinear and chaotic nature of turbulent flows poses a major\nchallenge for designing control strategies to maintain or induce low-drag\nlaminar states. In this work, we study the concept of the minimal seed for\nrelaminarization - the smallest perturbation of a turbulent state that triggers\na direct transition to laminar flow without a chaotic transient. We formulate\nthe identification of this optimal perturbation as a fully nonlinear\noptimization problem and develop a numerical framework based on a multi-step\npenalty method to compute it. Applying this framework to the nine-mode\nMoehlis-Faisst-Eckhardt model of a sinusoidal shear flow, we compute the\nminimal seeds for both transition to turbulence and relaminarization. While\nboth of these minimal seeds lie infinitesimally close to the laminar-turbulent\nboundary -- the so-called edge of chaos -- they are generally unrelated and lie\nin qualitatively distinct regions of state space, thereby providing different\ninsights into the flow's underlying structure. We find that while the optimal\nperturbation for triggering transition is primarily in the direction of the\nmode representing streamwise vortices, or rolls, the optimal perturbation for\nrelaminarization is distributed across multiple modes, without strong\ncontributions in the roll or streak directions. While counterintuitive, this\nfinding indicates that fully nonlinear control schemes exploiting the structure\nof the turbulent attractor might offer great improvements over classical\nmethods based on linearizations and those which simply counteract the dominant\nfeatures of the turbulent flow. The laminarizing trajectory obtained from the\nminimal seed for relaminarization also provides an efficient pathway out of the\nturbulent region of state space to the laminar state and can therefore inform\nthe design and evaluation of flow control strategies for inducing\nlaminarization.",

Unlike\nexisting methods, our approach requires neither polarized nucleon beams nor\nfinal-state hadron identification, relying instead on fully inclusive\ncalorimetric measurements.

    "abstract": "Doing quantitative computed tomography (CT) using Bremsstrahlung sources\nrequires an estimate of the spectrum emitted by the X-ray source. One method of\nbeam hardening correction (BHC), as described by Lifton[1], first uses\ntransmission measurements of a known material and range of thicknesses to\nestimate the spectrum and then uses the estimated spectrum to correct the beam\nhardening error, not necessarily on the same material as used for estimating\nthe spectrum. We adopt Lifton's BHC procedure and through simulations show how\nthe uncertainties in the transmission measurements and the uncertainties in the\nmaterial thickness measurements propagate to uncertainties in the spectrum, the\nbeam hardening correction curve and thence to uncertainties in the beam\nhardening corrected CT reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources\nacross domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology\nalignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality\ncorrespondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the\nalignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate\nmappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large\nontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language\nModels (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses\nonly on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology\nalignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation\nover several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative\n(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using\ndifferent ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared\nagainst simulated Oracles with variable error rates.",

    "abstract": "We introduce causal geodesy, a framework for studying the landscape of\nstochastic interventions that lie between the two extremes of performing no\nintervention, and performing a sharp intervention that sets an exposure equal\nto a specific value. We define this framework by constructing paths of\ndistributions that smoothly interpolate between the treatment density and a\npoint mass at the target intervention. Thus, each path starts at a purely\nobservational (or correlational) quantity and moves into a counterfactual\nworld. Of particular interest are paths that correspond to geodesics in some\nmetric, i.e. the shortest path.

In this regard, there is a great\npossibility that dark energy can interact with the compact stellar matter\nconfiguration [Phys. Rev. D 103, 084042 (2021)]. In this article, we introduce\na physically viable model for celestial compact stars made of isotropic\nbaryonic matter and isotropic dark energy with Heintzmann's ansatz [Zeitschrift\nf\\\"ur Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)] in the context of Einstein's gravity. Here,\nthe density of dark energy is assumed to be proportional to the density of\nbaryonic matter. The main focus of the present article is to see the effects of\ndark energy on the physical properties of the stars. We perform an in-depth\nanalysis of the physical attributes of the model, such as metric function,\ndensity, pressure, mass-radius relation, compactness parameter, gravitational\nand surface redshifts, along with the energy conditions for three well-known\ncompact stars. We analyse the equilibrium of the present model via the\ngeneralised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the stability with the help\nof the adiabatic index and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov's static stability\ncondition.

However, these benefits are significantly degraded under\nmobility due to channel aging, and further exacerbated by the unique near-field\n(NF) and spatial non-stationarity (SnS) propagation in such systems. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel channel prediction approach that\nincorporates dedicated channel modeling, probabilistic representations, and\nBayesian inference algorithms for this emerging scenario. Specifically, we\ndevelop tensor-structured channel models in both the spatial-frequency-temporal\n(SFT) and beam-delay-Doppler (BDD) domains, which leverage temporal\ncorrelations among multiple pilot symbols for channel prediction. The factor\nmatrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids\nand SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and\nslopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch.

Based on the probabilistic models, we\ndevelop tensor-structured bi-layer inference (TS-BLI) algorithm under the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) framework, which reduces computational complexity\nvia tensor operations by leveraging the bi-layer factor graph for approximate\nE-step inference and an alternating strategy with closed-form updates in the\nM-step.

    "abstract": "Global weather patterns and regimes are heavily influenced by the dominant\nmodes of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability, including the El\nNi\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability\n(TPDV), North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM), and the Pacific Decadal\nOscillation (PDO). However, separating these modes of variability remains\nchallenging due to their spatial overlap and possible nonlinear coupling, which\nviolates the assumptions of traditional linear methods. We develop a\nKnowledge-Guided AutoEncoder (KGAE) that uses spectral constraints to identify\nphysically interpretable modes, without the need for predefined temporal\nfilters or thresholds. The KGAE separates ENSO-like modes on 2- and 3-7-year\ntimescales and a decadal mode with characteristics reminiscent of the PDO and\nthe NPMM, each with distinct spatial patterns. We demonstrate that the decadal\nmode modulates ENSO diversity (central Pacific versus eastern Pacific), and\nthat a quasibiennial mode leads and follows the interannual mode, suggesting a\nrole in ENSO onset and decay. When applied to climate model output, KGAEs\nreveal model-specific biases in ENSO diversity and seasonal timing. Finally,\nresidual training isolates a primarily equatorial decadal mode, which may be a\ncomponent of TPDV-related decadal variability, likely originating from\nadvection linked to upwelling near the Gal\\'apagos Islands and the South\nEquatorial Current. Our results highlight how machine learning can uncover\nphysically meaningful modes of Earth system variability and improve the\nrepresentation and evaluation of variability across models and timescales.",

    "abstract": "Polarization, defined as the emergence of sharply divided groups with\nopposing and often extreme views, is an increasingly prominent feature of\nmodern societies. While many studies analyze this phenomenon in the context of\nsingle issues, such as public opinion on abortion or immigration, this approach\noverlooks that political and social attitudes rarely develop in isolation.\nInstead, many issues are interconnected, shaped by overarching ideological\nframeworks that guide interpretations and position-taking across multiple\ntopics. These frameworks produce coherent yet polarized worldviews that\nreinforce group boundaries. In this work, we propose and study a multi-topic\nopinion dynamics model that captures these interdependencies. Each issue is\nrepresented as a separate dimension in a shared opinion space, allowing us to\nmodel not only attitudes toward individual topics but also the structure of\nideological alignment across them. A central feature is topic correlation,\nwhich enables us to explore how polarization emerges when opinions on one issue\ninfluence attitudes on others. The model also incorporates homophily, a\nmechanism where individuals are more likely to interact with those similar to\nthemselves. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the model by identifying its\nmost relevant fixed points, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulations. We then examine how the multidimensional opinion space shapes the\nemergence and stability of polarization, and apply the model to empirical data\nfrom the American National Election Studies, interpreting observed opinion\npatterns within our framework.",

We prove an impossibility result:\nno algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover\nthe most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information\nneeded to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt\nversus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model\nrequires recovering preferences over \\emph{models} (rather than just\nresponses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response\nquality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000\ncardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established\ntool from experimental economics.

    "abstract": "This paper presents novel methods for achieving stable and efficient\nconvergence in multivariable extremum seeking control (ESC) using sliding mode\ntechniques. Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and\nmore recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a\nnew framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based\nESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies\nin the use of discontinuous \"relay-type\" control components, replacing\ntraditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic\nnonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the\nfirst attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes\nwithin the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach,\nthe convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective\nfunction. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by\nemploying a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a\nRiccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the\nclosed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging\nLyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with\ndiscontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed\nmethod, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness\ncompared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only\nexponential stability. The results also demonstrate that the Gradient-based\nmethod exhibits slower convergence and higher transients since the gradient\ntrajectory follows the curved and steepest-descent path, whereas the\nNewton-based method achieves faster convergence and improved overall\nperformance going straightly to the extremum.",

This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput\nprediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation\nalgorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series\narchitectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse\nreal-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client\nheterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction\nperformance.

Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,\nthey require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher\ncontext dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance\nbetween accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end\napplicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into\na live adaptive streaming pipeline.

As neuromorphic\ncomputing systems operate based on spike events, their energy consumption is\nclosely related to spiking activity, i.e., each spike incurs computational and\npower costs; consequently, minimizing the number of spikes is a critical\nstrategy for operating under constrained energy budgets. To support this goal,\nASPEN utilizes stochastic perturbations to the neuronal threshold during\ntraining to not only enhance the network's robustness across varying\nthresholds, which can be controlled at inference time, but also act as a\nregularizer that improves generalization, reduces spiking activity, and enables\nenergy control without the need for complex retraining or pruning. More\nspecifically, ASPEN adaptively adjusts intrinsic neuronal parameters as a\nlightweight and scalable technique for dynamic energy control without\nreconfiguring the entire model. Our evaluation on neuromorphic emulator and\nhardware shows that ASPEN significantly reduces spike counts and energy\nconsumption while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.",

It lifts the stringent assumption\nof the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal\nmasses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers\ngreater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.\nNevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic\nregularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,\nhindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In\nthis paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the\nliterature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic\nregularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces\nsparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT\nin many applications with sparsity requirements.

Despite its apparent simplicity, the literature has\npointed out that students at different educational levels have difficulty\nunderstanding it, especially due to the abstraction associated with the\nconcepts of electric voltage, electric current, and electrical resistance. In\norder to provide possibilities to overcome this abstraction and the associated\nlearning difficulties, the present work proposes an experimental activity that\napplies Ohm's law to determine the nanometer-scale thickness of 6B graphite\ntraces deposited on tracing paper. The employed methodology is based on\nmeasuring physical quantities such as electric voltage, electric current, and\nlength, and on analyzing the collected data. The thickness of the graphite\ntraces determined by this method was also compared with values obtained using a\nscanning probe microscope (SPM). Based on the proposed methodology, the\nthickness of the traces was determined to be 456.5(34)~nm, while SPM\nmeasurements yielded an average thickness of 440(50)~nm. Thus, the results show\ngood agreement between the measurements within experimental uncertainties,\nvalidating the effectiveness of the suggested methodology and indicating that\nit is a viable proposal for electricity courses in higher education and, with\nadaptations, even for high school.",

Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling\ngate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in\nonly 14.8 $\\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates.\nThe entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences.\nTwo-qubit entangling gates have an average fidelity of 0.96(1), and the\nfour-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential\nfour-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to\nother solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation\nand control of entanglement in practical devices.",

Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while\nachieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural\noverhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against\nadvanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its\npractical applicability in securing IC designs.

We show that these systems naturally realize the\ngeneralization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary\ndiscrete gauge groups. A one-body dynamics emulates that of a particle carrying\na superposition of charges, each coupled to distinct static gauge-field\nconfiguration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the\nirreducible representations of the commutator subgroup $C \\subset G$, while the\nWilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the\nembedding of $C$ in $G$. The role of other subgroups in shaping both the\nlattice geometry and the dynamics is analyze in depth assuming $C$ finite. We\ndiscuss a theorem of direct engineering relevance that, for any cyclic gauge\ngroup, yields all compatible translation groups. We then construct\ntwo-dimensional examples of Cayley-crystals equivalent to square lattices\nthreaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes.

However, most are characterized using only\nultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star\nformation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten\nfar-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for\ntwo spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616\n($z_{\\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing\nthe full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based\ninterpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously\nidentified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured\ngalaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively\nstar-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its\nmolecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth.\nIn contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a\nprolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in\nstellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})$ = 11.72\nover the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in\nboth UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may\nhave contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to\nform stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet\nsuppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio\nobservations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim3$.",

A critical machine learning task on these graphs\nis node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news\ndetection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.\nAlthough Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these\ncontexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation\nmethods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node\ntype and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address\nthese gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that\nsynthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete\ndenoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features\n(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,\nwhereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces.

Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key\nassumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal\ngraph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they\nare often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing\nmethods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with\nscalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel\nframework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the\npresence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach\nalternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder\ndistribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments\non synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that\nDCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery\nand confounder identification.

Ionic liquids\nhave not previously been considered as naturally occurring substances, and thus\nhave not been discussed in planetary science. We demonstrate in laboratory\nexperiments that ionic liquids can form from planetary materials: Sulfuric acid\ncombined with nitrogen-containing organic molecules. Sulfuric acid can be\nvolcanic in origin, and organic compounds are commonly found on planetary\nbodies. The required planetary surface is water-depleted and must support\nsulfuric acid transiently in liquid phase to dissolve organics, followed by\nevaporation of excess liquid, conditions spanning approximately 300 K at 10^-7\natm to 350-470 K at 0.01 atm. Because ionic liquids have extremely low vapor\npressures, they are not prone to evaporation, allowing small droplets or pools\nto persist without ocean-like reservoirs. Ionic liquids' minuscule vapor\npressure at room temperature suggests possible stability on planets with\nnegligible atmospheres, shielded by magnetic fields or rock crevices against\nharsh cosmic radiation. Ionic liquids can stably dissolve enzymes and other\nbiomolecules, enabling biocatalysis and offering a plausible solvent for life,\nbroadening the definition of habitable worlds.",

Despite their strong\nperformance guarantees, most existing work has focused primarily on improving\nthe operational accuracy of learned control policies and the convergence rates\nof learning algorithms, with comparatively little attention to uncertainty\nquantification and statistical inference. Yet, these aspects are essential for\nassessing the reliability and variability of control policies, especially in\nhigh-stakes applications. In this paper, we study statistical inference for the\npolicy gradient (PG) method for noisy Linear Quadratic Reinforcement learning\n(LQ RL) over a finite time horizon, where linear dynamics with both known and\nunknown drift parameters are controlled subject to a quadratic cost. We\nestablish the theoretical foundations for statistical inference in LQ RL,\nderiving exact asymptotics for both the PG estimators and the corresponding\nobjective loss. Furthermore, we introduce a principled inference framework that\nleverages online bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals for both the\nlearned optimal policy and the corresponding objective losses. The method\nupdates the PG estimates along with a set of randomly perturbed PG estimates as\nnew observations arrive. We prove that the proposed bootstrapping procedure is\ndistributionally consistent and that the resulting confidence intervals achieve\nboth asymptotic and non-asymptotic validity. Notably, our results imply that\nthe quantiles of the exact distribution can be approximated at a rate of\n$n^{-1/4}$, where $n$ is the number of samples used during the procedure. The\nproposed procedure is easy to implement and applicable to both offline and\nfully online settings.

    "abstract": "The framework of ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) has recently\nre-emerged as a powerful, safe and operator-independent way to image the\nbreast. State of the art image reconstruction methods are performed with\niterative techniques based on deterministic optimization algorithms in the\nfrequency domain in the 300 kHz - 1 MHz bandwidth. Alternative algorithms with\ndeterministic and stochastic optimization have been considered in the\ntime-domain. In this paper, we present the equivalent stochastic inversion in\nthe frequency domain (phase encoding), with a focus on reconstructing the speed\nof sound. We test the inversion algorithm on synthetic data in 2D and 3D, by\nexplicitly differentiating between inverse crime and non-inverse crime\nscenarios, and compare against the deterministic inversion. We then show the\nresults of the stochastic inversion in the frequency domain on experimental\ndata. By leveraging on the concepts of multiple super-shots and stochastic\nensembles, we provide robust evidence that image quality of a stochastic\nreconstruction of the speed of sound with phase encoding in the frequency\ndomain is comparable, and essentially equivalent, to the one of a deterministic\nreconstruction, with the further benefit of drastically reducing reconstruction\ntimes by more than half.",

The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be\nprogrammed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after\nflow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the\ndipoles. This multi-memory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of\ndirectional information.

    "abstract": "Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of\nhyperspectral unmixing algorithms. Many methods address complex spectral\nvariability; yet large-scale distortions to the scale of the observed pixel\nsignatures due to topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major\nchallenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate\nmodel fitting. Because of this, correcting these variations can offer\nsignificant advantages in real-world GIS applications. In this paper, we\npropose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral\nvariability prior to unmixing. By estimating and correcting these distortions\nto the scale of the pixel signatures, the algorithm produces pixel signatures\nwith minimal distortions in scale. Since these distortions in scale (which\nhinder the performance of many unmixing methods) are greatly minimized in the\noutput provided by the proposed method, the abundance estimation of the\nunmixing algorithms is significantly improved. We present a rigorous\nmathematical framework to describe and correct for scale variability and\nprovide extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm.\nFurthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art unmixing methods on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral\ndatasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance\nof these algorithms, achieving error reductions of around 50%, even for\nalgorithms specifically designed to handle spectral variability. This\ndemonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating\nmore accurate unmixing with existing methods. The algorithm's generality,\nconsistent impact, and significant influence highlight its potential as a key\ncomponent in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order\nto better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit\ndifferentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially\nnon-differentiable) black box.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical\nfrontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully\ndigital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their\nadoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to\nlarge-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and\nfabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has\nproposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and\noptical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks\nand hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic\nand hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and\nsegmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design\nbefore training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified\nconstraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce\nNeural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with\nelectronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After\nfabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate\nfor implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,\nCIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline\nconsistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both\npre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.",

Consequently,\nthis problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,\nOffline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline\ndata to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To\nleverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design\nwithin each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\deff T \\log \\left(|\\mathcal{A}|T\\right)}+d^2)$. $\\deff \\leq\nd)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly\nexplored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum\n$(\\lambda_k)_{k \\in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The\neigen-spectrum $(\\lambda_k)_{k \\in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the\n\\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\\deff\n\\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting\nwhile, when offline data is abundant ($\\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\\deff =\no(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the\nfirst known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly\non the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality\nof our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or\npoorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended\noptimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to\n$O\\left(\\frac{d^{2}}{\\deff} \\min \\{ \\deff,1\\} \\right)$, which can be\nsubstantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\\deff =\n\\Omega(1)$.",

However, drawing causal\nconclusions in this setting is challenging due to irregular follow-up,\nindividual-level heterogeneity, and time-varying confounding. Bayesian Additive\nRegression Trees (BART) and their extension, Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF),\nhave proven powerful for flexible causal inference in observational data,\nespecially for heterogeneous treatment effects and non-linear outcome surfaces.\nYet, both models assume independence across observations and are fundamentally\nlimited in their ability to model within-individual correlation over time. This\nlimits their use in real-world longitudinal settings where repeated measures\nare the norm. Motivated by the NO.MS dataset, the largest and most\ncomprehensive clinical trial dataset in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with more than\n35,000 patients and up to 15 years follow-up, we develop BCFLong, a\nhierarchical model that preserves BART's strengths while extending it for\nlongitudinal analysis. Inspired by BCF, we decompose the mean into prognostic\nand treatment effects, modelling the former on Image Quality Metrics (IQMs) to\naccount for scanner effects, and introduce individual-specific random effects,\nincluding intercepts and slope, with a sparsity-inducing horseshoe prior.\nSimulations confirm BCFLong's superior performance and robustness to sparsity,\nsignificantly improving outcome and treatment effect estimation. On NO.MS,\nBCFLong captures clinically meaningful longitudinal patterns in brain volume\nchange, which would have otherwise remained undetected. These findings\nhighlight the importance of adaptively accounting for within-individual\ncorrelations and position BCFLong as a flexible framework for causal inference\nin longitudinal data.",

These survey formats, however, may be subject to two possible\nsystematic errors. First, students may report more peers' names on a\nrecognition survey than a recall survey because the course roster facilitates\ntheir memory of their interactions, whereas they may only remember a subset of\ntheir interactions on the recall format. Second, recognition surveys may be\nsubject to name order effects, where students are more likely to select peers'\nnames that appear early on in the roster than those that appear later on (e.g.,\ndue to survey fatigue). Here we report the results of two methodological\nstudies of these possible errors in the context of introductory physics\ncourses: one directly comparing 65 student responses to recognition and recall\nversions of the same network survey prompt, and the other measuring name order\neffects on 54 recognition surveys from 27 different courses.

We do this by developing doubly robust confidence intervals for the\ncontinuous treatment effect curve (at a fixed point) under the assumption that\nit is monotonic, based on inverting a likelihood ratio-type test. Monotonicity\nof the treatment effect curve is often a very natural assumption, and this\nassumption removes the need to choose a smoothing or tuning parameter for the\nnonparametrically estimated curve. The likelihood ratio procedure is effective\nbecause it allows us to avoid estimating the curve's unknown bias, which is\nchallenging to do. The test statistic is ``doubly robust'' in that a remainder\nterm is the product of errors for the two so-called nuisance functions that\nnaturally arise (the outcome regression and generalized propensity score\nfunctions), which allows one nuisance to be estimated poorly if the other is\nestimated well. Furthermore, we propose a version of our test or confidence\ninterval that is adaptive to a range of the unknown curve's flatness level. We\npresent versions with and without cross fitting.

Each comparison to\nthe synthetic sporadic population is repeated to estimate the 3-sigma region\nfor which the cumulative similarity distribution is consistent with random\nassociation levels.\n  Results. The observed DN cumulative similarity distribution between 46\ninstrumentally observed meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping\nfireballs, and over 30k NEAs radiants (estimated using 6 different radiant\nmethods) reveals no statistically significant excess of similarity between the\npopulations consistent with streams.\n  Conclusions. Based on nearly 600 fireball observations, there is no\nstatistically significant clustering between meteorite falls and NEAs using\ngeocentric impact parameters. If some meteorites arrive in streams, they make\nup less than ~0.1% of all falls. Recent asteroid or meteoroid physical\nprocesses could still explain features found in meteorites, but this activity\nis not producing distinguishable orbital streams or pairs.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language\nreasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success\nrates by $67\\%$ and harmfulness by $21\\%$, revealing a previously\nunderappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.",

Here, we develop a\nstatistical field-theoretic approach to understanding collective activity in\nnetworks of compartmental neurons, including those generating multiple types of\nspikes.

    "abstract": "We develop a synthesis of orthomodular logic (projections as propositions)\nwith operator fixed-point theory in Hilbert spaces. First, we introduce an\nanchored implication connective $A \\Rightarrow^{\\mathrm{comm}}_{P} B$, defined\nsemantically so that it is true only when either $A$ is false or else $A$ is\ntrue and $B$ is true in a ''commuting'' context specified by a fixed nonzero\nprojection $P$. This connective refines material implication by adding a side\ncondition $[E_B,P]=0$ (commutation of $B$ with the anchor) and reduces to\nclassical implication in the Boolean (commuting) case. Second, we study\nfixed-point convergence under event-indexed contractions. For a single\nnonexpansive (not necessarily linear) map $T$, we prove that the event-indexed\ncondition is equivalent to the classical assertion that some power $T^N$ is a\nstrict contraction; thus the ''irregular events'' phrasing does not add\ngenerality in that setting. We then present the genuinely more general case of\nvarying operators (switching/randomized): if blocks of the evolving composition\nare contractive with bounded inter-event gaps and a common fixed point exists,\nwe obtain uniqueness and an explicit envelope rate. Finally, with an anchor $P$\nthat commutes with $T$, the same reasoning ensures convergence on $PH$ under\nevent-indexed contraction on that subspace. We include precise scope\nconditions, examples, and visual explanations.",

    "abstract": "As modern AI workloads increasingly rely on heterogeneous accelerators,\nensuring high-bandwidth and layout-flexible data movements between accelerator\nmemories has become a pressing challenge. Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines\npromise high bandwidth utilization for data movements but are typically optimal\nonly for contiguous memory access, thus requiring additional software loops for\ndata layout transformations. This, in turn, leads to excessive control overhead\nand underutilized on-chip interconnects. To overcome this inefficiency, we\npresent XDMA, a distributed and extensible DMA architecture that enables\nlayout-flexible data movements with high link utilization. We introduce three\nkey innovations: (1) a data streaming engine as XDMA Frontend, replacing\nsoftware address generators with hardware ones; (2) a distributed DMA\narchitecture that maximizes link utilization and separates configuration from\ndata transfer; (3) flexible plugins for XDMA enabling on-the-fly data\nmanipulation during data transfers. XDMA demonstrates up to 151.2x/8.2x higher\nlink utilization than software-based implementations in synthetic workloads and\nachieves 2.3x average speedup over accelerators with SoTA DMA in real-world\napplications. Our design incurs <2% area overhead over SoTA DMA solutions while\nconsuming 17% of system power. XDMA proves that co-optimizing memory access,\nlayout transformation, and interconnect protocols is key to unlocking\nheterogeneous multi-accelerator SoC performance.",

In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go).

Our\ntaxonomy organizes disclosure tactics based on how they change the data\nrepresentation underlying a chart, providing a systematic way to reason about\ndesign trade-offs in terms of what information is revealed, distorted, or\nhidden. We demonstrate the benefits of using our taxonomy by showing how it can\nguide reasoning in design scenarios where disclosure is a first-order\nconsideration.

In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a\ndomain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting\ndecisions in Magic: The Gathering.

With\nthis, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly\nadapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison\nto zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model.

Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune\nsmaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.\nDespite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show\nthat solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can\nenable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.",

Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this\ntask, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However,\nthe utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are\nonly useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires\nextrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are\nlargely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to\nassess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision\nfor $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and\nexplain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation\nform a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link\nthe number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each\nisotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be\nfactorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms\ncorresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).\nRemarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost\nentirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969.

    "abstract": "In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be\nGaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical\nform derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this\nGaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and\ncosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB)\ngenerated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this\nwork, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features\nin PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or\nsignal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this\napproach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully\nanalytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This\nmakes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis\ntools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by\nproducing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred\nfrom the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We\nvalidate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to\nnon-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function\nof the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically\nmotivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB\nand show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual\nsource. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a\nsimulated population of SMBHBs.",

We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms\narranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals\ninteractions.

    "abstract": "Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance\ninstability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole,\nintroducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When\nthe black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions\namong different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact\non the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted\ngravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were\nproposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate\nthe effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on\nthe gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to\na density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles\nand that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of\nhyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine\ntransitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant\ntransitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings,\nespecially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory,\nthe Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and\nequatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the\nmass range $10^{-15}\\,{\\rm eV} \\, - \\, 10^{-13}\\, {\\rm eV}$ through\ngravitational wave observations.",

For binaries containing a white dwarf, we find a\ncomplex dependence of the wide binary fraction on the white dwarf mass,\nincluding a steep decline as a function of mass at >0.6Msun. Furthermore, we\nfind that wide binaries containing white dwarfs have significantly lower\neccentricities than main-sequence binaries at the same separations. To model\nthese observations, we compute the effects of post-main-sequence mass loss on\nthe orbital parameters of wide binaries in all regimes of timescales, from\nsecular to impulsive, and incorporate this dynamics in a population synthesis\nmodel. We find that adiabatic expansion of the orbits in binaries with slow\nenough evolutionary processes is the most likely explanation for the puzzling\neccentricity distribution of white dwarf wide binaries. The steeply declining\nwhite dwarf binary fraction as a function of mass requires that the timescale\nfor mass loss must be significantly shorter for high-mass stars (10^3-10^4\nyears) than for the low-mass ones. We confirm previous studies that suggested\nthat recoil in the range 0.25-4 km/s is required to explain the observed\ndistribution of separations of white dwarf wide binaries. Finally, for low-mass\nwhite dwarfs (<0.5Msun), we see interesting signatures of their formation due\nto close binary evolution in their wide binary statistics.

In\ncontrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that\nthe theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent,\nparticularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these\nissues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral\nrepresentation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET).

We analyze bright ($G<13$) and metal-poor\n([Fe/H]$<-1.2$) stars located far from the disk ($|z|\\geq1$ kpc), and explore a\ntotal of $19$ abundances.

The spin ladder is described\nby an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange\ninteractions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary\nsituations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In\nthe strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2\nchain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and\nproviding a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that\neffective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM\ninteractions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM\ninteractions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be\nrealized in the effective spin-1/2 model.

Despite their theoretical significance,\nexperimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing\ncontrolled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization\nof the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by\nemploying single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of\nquasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a\nphase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian\nlimit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally\nprobe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized\nby the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel\nspectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all\nquasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to\nchanges in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological\norigins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry\nbreaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for\nfuture exploration of synthetic quantum matter.",

This ability is rooted in\nour accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding\nof physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural\nnetworks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for\nthis task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the\nimage, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,\nresulting in unrealistic animations.

The\ninhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas\nproperties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model\nassumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary\nannihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons (\n$\\gamma \\gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a\nrange of annihilation cross-sections. For $\\gamma \\gamma$ channel, the\ndistinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean\nfree path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy\ndeposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can\neffectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases.\nDespite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects\nremain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio\ninterferometers, such as the SKA.

Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing\nexisting models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They\ntypically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio\nembeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via\ncross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related\npriors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation\nacross video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to\ndrift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,\nStableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents\nerror accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose\na novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio\nsynchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent\nprediction as a dynamic guidance signal.

Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of\nfacilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial\nbut partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the\nhidden profile effect studied. To support further research into how LLM-based\ninterfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release\nour experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an\nopen-source tool.",

    "abstract": "Learning skills from human motions offers a promising path toward\ngeneralizable policies for versatile humanoid whole-body control, yet two key\ncornerstones are missing: (1) a high-quality motion tracking framework that\nfaithfully transforms large-scale kinematic references into robust and\nextremely dynamic motions on real hardware, and (2) a distillation approach\nthat can effectively learn these motion primitives and compose them to solve\ndownstream tasks. We address these gaps with BeyondMimic, a real-world\nframework to learn from human motions for versatile and naturalistic humanoid\ncontrol via guided diffusion. Our framework provides a motion tracking pipeline\ncapable of challenging skills such as jumping spins, sprinting, and cartwheels\nwith state-of-the-art motion quality. Moving beyond simply mimicking existing\nmotions, we further introduce a unified diffusion policy that enables zero-shot\ntask-specific control at test time using simple cost functions. Deployed on\nhardware, BeyondMimic performs diverse tasks at test time, including waypoint\nnavigation, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle avoidance, bridging\nsim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis of human motion primitives\nfor whole-body control. https://beyondmimic.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand\nchallenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and\nadaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,\nalthough large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task\nplanning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to\ntabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited\nactuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies\nexhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object\nconfigurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for\npractical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform\nmaneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings\nremains understudied.\n  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for\nagile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates\nhigh-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the\nchallenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce\na hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling\nlong-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the\ncontrol level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across\nchallenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon\nmobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through\nsuccessful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and\nrobustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged\nmanipulators in unstructured environments.

The standard approach to\nretrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from\nbright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,\nin contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants\nexhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to\nseparate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from\nthese contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our\nability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are\nincoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent\nexcess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this\npaper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process\nregression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them\nfrom the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of\nobservation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic\nsignals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric\nvisibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes\ncontaining foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The\nsimulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract\nincoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over\nstandard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the\ncontaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a\nvariety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can\nsubtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing\nthe 21-cm signal.",

    "abstract": "We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during\nthe inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations\nindicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the\nrange of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields\nas high as $ \\sim 10^{17-18}\\,\\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these\nfields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated\nevolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In\ncontrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial\neccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the\ngravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction\nbetween the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's\neffective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a\nperturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational\nwave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable\nmagnetic fields, $10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\\sim 10\n\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while\n$10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For\nextreme fields of $10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be\nsensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO is limited to galactic\ndistances: $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\\sim\n100\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\\sim\n10^{16}$-$10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable at Gpc distances. In\nhighly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational\nwave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon.\nThese findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories\nmay be capable of identifying magnetized binary systems.",

Here, we reject the notion that ethics sinks are a\nnecessary consequence of introducing AI systems into bureaucracies. Rather,\nwhere they appear, they are the product of structural design decisions across\nboth the technology and the institution deploying it. We support this claim via\na systematic application of conceptions of moral agency in AI ethics to\nWeberian bureaucracy.

We present a three-point Moral\nAgency Framework for legitimate integration of AI in bureaucratic structures:\n(a) maintain clear and just human lines of accountability, (b) ensure humans\nwhose work is augmented by AI systems can verify the systems are functioning\ncorrectly, and (c) introduce AI only where it doesn't inhibit the capacity of\nbureaucracies towards either of their twin aims of legitimacy and stewardship.\nWe suggest that AI introduced within this framework can not only improve\nefficiency and productivity while avoiding ethics sinks, but also improve the\ntransparency and even the legitimacy of a bureaucracy.",

    "abstract": "The next generation of rare-event search experiments in nuclear and particle\nphysics demand structural materials combining exceptional mechanical strength\nwith ultra-low levels of radioactive contamination. This study evaluates\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) nickel as a candidate structural material for\nsuch applications. Manufacturer-supplied CVD Ni grown on aluminum substrates\nunderwent tensile testing before and after welding alongside standard Ni\nsamples. CVD Ni exhibited a planar tensile strength of ~600 MPa, significantly\nsurpassing standard nickel. However, welding and heat treatment were found to\nreduce the tensile strength to levels comparable to standard Ni, with observed\nporosity in the welds likely contributing to this reduction. Material assay via\ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) employing\nisotope-dilution produced measured bulk concentration of 232-Th, 238-U, and\nnat-K at the levels of ~70 ppq, <100 ppq, and ~900 ppt, respectively, which is\nthe lowest reported in nickel. Surface-etch profiling uncovered higher\nconcentrations of these contaminants extending ~10 micrometer beneath the\nsurface, likely associated with the aluminum growth substrate. The results\nreported are compared to the one other well documented usage of CVD Ni in a low\nradioactive background physics research experiment and a discussion is provided\non how the currently reported results may arise from changes in CVD fabrication\nor testing process. These results establish CVD Ni as a promising\nlow-radioactivity structural material, while outlining the need for further\ndevelopment in welding and surface cleaning techniques to fully realize its\npotential in large-scale, low radioactive background rare-event search\nexperiments.",

Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness.

    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step\nreasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures.",

    "abstract": "Hazardous environments such as chemical spills, radiological zones, and\nbio-contaminated sites pose significant threats to human safety and public\ninfrastructure. Rapid and reliable hazard mitigation in these settings often\nunsafe for humans, calling for autonomous systems that can adaptively sense and\nrespond to evolving risks. This paper presents a decision-making framework for\nautonomous vehicle dispatch in hazardous environments with uncertain and\nevolving risk levels. The system integrates a Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound\n(BUCB) sensing strategy with task-specific vehicle routing problems with\nprofits (VRPP), enabling adaptive coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) for hazard sensing and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for cleaning.\nUsing VRPP allows selective site visits under resource constraints by assigning\neach site a visit value that reflects sensing or cleaning priorities.\nSite-level hazard beliefs are maintained through a time-weighted Bayesian\nupdate. BUCB scores guide UAV routing to balance exploration and exploitation\nunder uncertainty, while UGV routes are optimized to maximize expected hazard\nreduction under resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nframework reduces the number of dispatch cycles to resolve hazards by around\n30% on average compared to baseline dispatch strategies, underscoring the value\nof uncertainty-aware vehicle dispatch for reliable hazard mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting\nmotor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide\nexternal timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait\npatterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for\nadapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject\nvariability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts\nand motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and\nresults in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space\nAlignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific\nrecentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to\nenhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised\nCommon Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and\nsequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the\ngeometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.\nUsing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements across subjects and conditions.

    "abstract": "The data-processing inequality ensures quantum channels reduce state\ndistinguishability, with contraction coefficients quantifying optimal bounds.\nHowever, these can be overly optimistic and not representative of the usual\nbehavior. We study how noise contracts distinguishability of `typical' states,\nbeyond the worst-case. To that end, we introduce and study a family of moments\nof contraction for quantum divergences, which interpolate between the\nworst-case contraction coefficient of a channel and its average behavior under\na chosen ensemble of input states. We establish general properties of these\nmoments, relate moments for different divergences, and derive bounds in terms\nof channel parameters like the entropy or purity of its Choi state.\n  Focusing on the trace distance, we obtain upper and lower bounds on its\naverage contraction under tensor-product noise channels, and prove that,\ndepending on the local noise strength, there is a phase transition in the limit\nof many channel uses: below a critical error rate the average contraction\nremains near unity, whereas above it decays exponentially with system size. We\nextend these phase-transition phenomena to random quantum circuits with unital\nnoise, showing that constant-depth noisy circuits do not shrink the trace\ndistance on average, even when given highly entangled states as input. In\ncontrast, even at $\\log\\log n$ depth, the average trace distance can become\nsuperpolynomially small.\n  Finally, we explore moments of contraction for f-divergences and discuss\napplications to local differential privacy, demonstrating that noise regimes\nensuring privacy can render outputs essentially indistinguishable on average.\nThus, our results provide a fine-grained framework to quantify typical channel\nnoise in quantum information and computation and unveil new phenomena in\ncontraction coefficients, such as phase transitions for average contraction.",

Conventional sequences typically aim to completely\nfreeze system dynamics, often resulting in long protocols whose length scales\nexponentially with system size. In this work, we introduce a general framework\nfor constructing time-optimal, selectively-tailored sequences that remove only\nspecific local interactions. By combining techniques from graph coloring and\nclassical coding theory, our approach enables compact and hardware-tailored\nsequences across diverse qubit platforms, efficiently canceling undesired\nHamiltonian terms while preserving target interactions. This opens up broad\napplications in quantum computing and simulation. At the core of our method is\na mapping between dynamical decoupling sequence design and error-detecting\ncodes, which allows us to leverage powerful coding-theoretic tools to construct\ncustomized sequences. To overcome exponential overheads, we exploit symmetries\nin colored interaction hypergraphs, extending graph-coloring strategies to\narbitrary many-body Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework through concrete examples, including compact sequences that suppress\nresidual ZZ and ZZZ interactions in superconducting qubits and Heisenberg\nexchange coupling in spin qubits.

    "abstract": "We characterize the lower and upper attainability of the Wiener bound (also\nknown as Voigt-Reuss bound) for singularly distributed conductive material\nmixtures. For the lower attainability we consider mixtures in which\nhigh-conductance materials support on sets having finite one-dimensional\nHausdorff measures. We show that, under a mild coercivity condition, the kernel\nof the effective tensor of the mixture is equal to the orthogonal complement of\nthe homotopy classes of closed paths in the supporting set. This shows that a\nperiodic planar network has positive definite effective tensor, i.e., it is\nresilient to fluctuations, if and only if the network is reticulate. We provide\na geometric characterization of the upper attainability by applying a\ntransformation from varifolds to matrix-valued measures. We show that this\ntransformation leads to an equivalence between two distinct notions from\nmaterial science and geometric measure theory respectively: conductance\nmaximality and area criticality. Based on this relation we show a pointwise\ndimension bound for mixtures that attain the upper Wiener bound by applying a\nfractional version of the monotonicity formula for stationary varifolds. This\ndimension bound illustrates how the maximality condition constrains the local\nanisotropy and the local distribution of conductance magnitudes.

While existing approaches leverage large-scale\nmultimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial\nrelationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this\napproach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video\nand audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training\nsolely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in\ncomplex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first\nlarge vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using\nonly RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream\nmedical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM\nincorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D\nmodality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation\nalgorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By\nemploying a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial\nfeatures with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any\nadditional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen\nsurgical scenarios and downstream tasks.",

We measure the angular velocities of each spot through center-of-mass\nand geometric ellipse-fitting methods to derive a differential rotation law for\nround {\\alpha}-sunspots. Results. Using over a decade of HMI data we derive a\ndifferential rotation law for {\\alpha}-sunspots. When compared to previous\nmeasurements we find that {\\alpha}-sunspots rotate 1.56% faster than the\nsurrounding quiet-Sun, but 1.35% slower than the average sunspot population.\nThis supports the hypothesis that the depth at which flux tubes are anchored\ninfluences sunspot motions across the solar disk. We extend this analysis to\nother stars by introducing a scaling law based on the rotation rates of these\nstars. This scaling law is implemented into the Stellar Activity Grid for\nExoplanets (SAGE) code to illustrate how differential rotation alters the\nphotometric modulation of active stars.

However,\nadhering to compliance requirements requires stakeholders to also disclose\nsensor and control data to regulators raising privacy concerns. In this paper,\nwe present a cyberattack detection framework that utilizes differentially\nprivate (DP) hypothesis tests geared towards enhancing regulatory confidence\nwhile alleviating privacy concerns of CIN stakeholders. The hallmark of our\napproach is a two phase privacy scheme that protects the privacy of covariance,\nas well as the associated sensor driven test statistics computed as a means to\ngenerate alarms. Theoretically, we show that our method induces a\nmisclassification error rate comparable to the non-DP cases while delivering\nrobust privacy guarantees. With the help of real-world datasets, we show the\nreliability of our DP-detection outcomes for a wide variety of attack scenarios\nfor interdependent stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral\npansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness\nis often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale\nfeature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,\nabundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are\ncritical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,\nVision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to\npreserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture\ntransitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.\nThese issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to\ndilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer\n(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening\nthrough improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.\nSpecifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to\nprioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level\nVariance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail\nlearning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and\nefficiency.

Although previous approaches\nhave attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical\nconstraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and\nphysical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of\nhuman perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven\nmetric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This\nmethod evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications\nneeded for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are\nable to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that\nserve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,\na novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of\nhuman motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ\nPearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by\nincorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture\nfidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical\nalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not\nonly aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of\nmotion fidelity than previous work.",

This simulates\nthe depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we\ntrain a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During\ninference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',\nmatches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human\nmesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts\nof the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body\nmesh.

    "abstract": "Logarithmic Hilbert and Quot spaces are generalizations of their traditional\nversions adapted to study pairs and degenerations. The logarithmic Quot spaces\nof $(X,D)$ parameterize \"algebraically transverse\" (logarithmically flat)\nquotient sheaves on degenerations of $X$. We prove boundedness and deduce\nproperness of logarithmic Quot spaces. The results complete the basic\nfoundations of logarithmic Quot spaces and specialize to work of Li-Wu and\nMaulik and the second author in special cases. Boundedness relies on two\nresults of independent interest. First, we show that for a simple normal\ncrossing pair $(X, D)$ and a subscheme $Z$, there is a smallest logarithmic\nspace ${X}^\\flat$ modifying $X$ such that the strict transform of $Z$ is\nalgebraically transverse. Precisely, given $Z$ in $X$, there is a canonical\nlogarithmic space $X^\\flat$ over $X$ with the following universal property - an\nsnc logarithmic blowup $X'\\to X$ makes the strict transform of $Z$\nalgebraically transverse if and only if $X'$ is a modification of $X^\\flat$.\nParallel results hold for arbitrary coherent sheaves. This proves boundedness\nfor logarithmic quotients with fixed tropicalization. A logarithmic quotient\nsheaf defines a K-tropicalization, an enhancement of tropicalization that is\nsensitive to scheme structures. The K-tropicalization has the same relationship\nto K-theory as traditional tropicalization has to Chow, and is related to\nGr\\\"obner theory and convex geometry via state and secondary polytopes. Using\nthe K-theory of toric bundles, we derive a balancing condition for\nK-tropicalizations that imposes strong finiteness properties. The second key\nresult is that K-tropicalizations with fixed numerics are parametrized by a\nfinite-dimensional polyhedral complex.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in\nclosed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation\nenvironments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a\nsubstantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some\napproaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic\nenvironments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,\nthese methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training\ndata, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel\ntrajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a\nframework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene\nreconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end\nautonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce\nReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance\nmodeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby\nreconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the\nsim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover\nmore corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),\nwhich adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego\nvehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).\nFinally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue\nof training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple\nstraight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves\nend-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning\nmethods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.",

It also captures\nsparsifying Cayley graphs by choosing a subset of generators. The former has\nbeen extensively studied with optimal sparsifiers known. The latter has\nreceived attention recently and was solved for a few special groups (e.g.,\n$\\mathbb{F}_2^n$).\n  Prior work shows any sum of PSD matrices can be sparsified down to $O(n)$\nelements. This bound however turns out to be too coarse and in particular\nyields no non-trivial bound for building Cayley sparsifiers for Cayley graphs.\n  In this work, we develop a new, instance-specific (i.e., specific to a given\ncollection $\\mathcal{A}$) theory of PSD matrix sparsification based on a new\nparameter $N^*(\\mathcal{A})$ which we call connectivity threshold that\ngeneralizes the threshold of the number of edges required to make a graph\nconnected.\n  Our main result gives a sparsifier that uses at most\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2}N^*(\\mathcal{A}) (\\log n)(\\log r))$ matrices and is\nconstructible in randomized polynomial time. We also show that we need\n$N^*(\\mathcal{A})$ elements to sparsify for any $\\epsilon < 0.99$.\n  As the main application of our framework, we prove that any Cayley graph can\nbe sparsified to $O(\\epsilon^{-2}\\log^4 N)$ generators.

Sandwich variance estimation\nrelies on regularity conditions that may be structurally violated.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving\nframework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in\nheterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using\na single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,\nHelsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,\nneonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global\nnormalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each\nclient trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring\nequal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained\nmodels fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields\nhighly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on\nHelsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation\nsignificantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy\nincreases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior\nmacro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,\ndemonstrating a more robust and fair global model.

Using large-scale\nsimulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market\nconditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal\nAMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving\nthese relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the\nmodel's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges:\nfees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient\nrevenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market\nconditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX\nand remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee\nprotects passive LPs from severe losses.

We show that\nMarkowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for\nportfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation\nof the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the\nsecurities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show\nthis, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his\nportfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his\nsecurities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio\nas with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and\nvariance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities\ndescribe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the\ndependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and\non the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random\nvolumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the\nconsecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation\nfor the portfolio's random returns.

Time reversal is achieved by\nimposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate,\nwhich can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new\nsynthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential\nis valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that\nis fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to\n2nd order.

In\norder to define evolutes we impose a notion of perpendicularity, which allows\nus to consider the normal spaces to a projective variety. The evolute of a\nprojective hypersurface is the envelope of the family of normal spaces. For a\nvariety of dimension $r$ in $n$-space, the evolute is defined as the $(n-r)$th\niterated cuspidal locus of the map from the total space of the normal spaces to\nprojective space. Thus the envelope can be interpreted as a $(n-r)$th order\nThom-Boardman singularity. Further higher order Thom-Boardman singularities\ncorrespond, for a curve in the plane or in 3-space, to classical objects like\nthe vertices of the curve; for a surface in 3-space, they give the cuspidal\ncurve - and its cusps - on the evolute.

While the impact of these\ndemonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing\napproaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples\nfrom large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a\ndiversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in\nbiomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:\nFirst, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by\noptimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for\nunlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to\nselect the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three\nbiomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),\nand text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along\nwith three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently\noutperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while\ndemonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance.

It functions as a question-answering design assistant,\ncapable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses\ngrounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing\nof both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive\nanalysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,\nautomated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.\nUnlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM\ndecouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over\narbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard\nLLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining\nthe same accuracy.

    "abstract": "Renewable energy integration into microgrids has become a key approach to\naddressing global energy issues such as climate change and resource scarcity.\nHowever, the variability of renewable sources and the rising occurrence of High\nImpact Low Probability (HILP) events require innovative strategies for reliable\nand resilient energy management. This study introduces a practical approach to\nmanaging microgrid resilience through Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(XDRL). It combines the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for\ndecision-making with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)\nmethod to improve the transparency of the actor network's decisions. A case\nstudy in Ongole, India, examines a microgrid with wind, solar, and battery\ncomponents to validate the proposed approach. The microgrid is simulated under\nextreme weather conditions during the Layla cyclone. LIME is used to analyse\nscenarios, showing the impact of key factors such as renewable generation,\nstate of charge, and load prioritization on decision-making. The results\ndemonstrate a Resilience Index (RI) of 0.9736 and an estimated battery lifespan\nof 15.11 years. LIME analysis reveals the rationale behind the agent's actions\nin idle, charging, and discharging modes, with renewable generation identified\nas the most influential feature. This study shows the effectiveness of\nintegrating advanced DRL algorithms with interpretable AI techniques to achieve\nreliable and transparent energy management in microgrids.",

However, despite recent progress, studies\nshow that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained\nlanguages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a\ntext-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg\nenhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently\nimproves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.",

The manager seeks an optimal dividend, reinsurance, and\ncapital injection strategy to maximize the expected weighted sum of the total\ndividend payments until the first ruin.

The state-of-the-art for\nperforming these fluid simulations relies on an Eulerian viewpoint, in which\nthe fluid domain is discretized into a mesh, and the governing equations\ndescribe the fluid motion as it passes through each cell of the mesh. However,\nit is unclear whether a Lagrangian viewpoint, in which the fluid is discretized\nby a collection of particles, can outperform Eulerian simulations in global\natmospheric simulations. To date, Lagrangian approaches have shown promise, but\ntend to produce smoother solutions. In this work, a new Lagrangian method is\ndeveloped to simulate the atmosphere in which particles are represented with\nspherical power cells. We introduce an efficient algorithm for computing these\ncells which are then used to discretize the spherical shallow water equations.\nMass conservation is enforced by solving a semi-discrete optimal transport\nproblem and a semi-implicit time stepping procedure is used to advance the\nsolution in time. We note that, in contrast to previous work, artificial\nviscosity is not needed to stabilize the simulation. The performance of the\nspherical Voronoi diagram calculation is first assessed, which shows that\nspherical Voronoi diagrams of 100 million sites can be computed in under 2\nminutes on a single machine. The new simulation method is then evaluated on\nstandard benchmark test cases, which shows that momentum and energy\nconservation of this new method is comparable to the latest Lagrangian approach\nfor simulating the spherical shallow water equations.",

Formal query languages such as SPARQL offer\nexpressive access but require users to understand the ontology's structure and\nsyntax. In contrast, visual exploration tools and basic keyword-based search\ninterfaces are easier to use but often lack flexibility and expressiveness. We\nintroduce FuzzyVis, a proof-of-concept system that enables intuitive and\nexpressive exploration of complex ontologies. FuzzyVis integrates two key\ncomponents: a fuzzy logic-based querying model built on fuzzy ontology\nembeddings, and an interactive visual interface for building and interpreting\nqueries. Users can construct new composite concepts by selecting and combining\nexisting ontology concepts using logical operators such as conjunction,\ndisjunction, and negation. These composite concepts are matched against the\nontology using fuzzy membership-based embeddings, which capture degrees of\nmembership and support approximate, concept-level similarity search. The visual\ninterface supports browsing, query composition, and partial search without\nrequiring formal syntax. By combining fuzzy semantics with embedding-based\nreasoning, FuzzyVis enables flexible interpretation, efficient computation, and\nexploratory learning.

This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art\ndetectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called\nGenerative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900\nstudent-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various\ndomains.

Since roots grow in real 3D\nspace, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits\nand their impact on root development.

This method includes the detection and matching of lateral\nroots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and\nthe integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex\nroot dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons\nshowed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the\neffectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in\nautomated breeding robots.

    "abstract": "Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and\ncoding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in\nchallenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are\ngenerally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.\nHowever, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can\nleverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an\nagent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning\n(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data\nefficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we\npropose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with\nhierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep\nsearch agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.\nAt the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides\nthe final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error\npropagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and\nirrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that\nHierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms\nvarious deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines\nin six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.",

In this work, we benchmark three\noperator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator\nNetworks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed\nparameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each\nspectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are\ntrained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant,\ntriangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of\nState-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates\nconstant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO\nmaintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with\nvoltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing\nparameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to\nvarying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster\nthan a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse\ntasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation,\nrecovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute\npercentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in\ncomparison with classical methods.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, Big Tech has faced increasing levels of worker\nactivism. While worker actions have resulted in positive outcomes (e.g.,\ncancellation of Google's Project Dragonfly), such successes have become\nincreasingly infrequent. This is, in part, because corporations have adjusted\ntheir strategies to dealing with increased worker activism (e.g., increased\nretaliation against workers, and contracts clauses that prevent cancellation\ndue to worker pressure). This change in company strategy prompts urgent\nquestions about updating worker strategies for influencing corporate behavior\nin an industry with vast societal impact. Current discourse on tech worker\nactivism often lacks empirical grounding regarding its scope, history, and\nstrategic calculus. Our work seeks to bridge this gap by firstly conducting a\nsystematic analysis of worker actions at Google and Microsoft reported in U.S.\nnewspapers to delineate their characteristics. We then situate these actions\nwithin the long history of labour movements and demonstrate that, despite\nperceptions of radicalism, contemporary tech activism is comparatively\nmoderate. Finally, we engage directly with current and former tech activists to\nprovide a novel catalogue of potential worker actions, evaluating their\nperceived risks, impacts, and effectiveness (concurrently publishing \"Tech\nWorkers' Guide to Resistance\"). Our findings highlight considerable variation\nin strategic thinking among activists themselves. We conclude by arguing that\nthe establishment of a radical flank could increase the effectiveness of\ncurrent movements.\n  \"Tech Workers' Guide to Resistance\" can be found at\nhttps://www.cs.toronto.edu/~msa/TechWorkersResistanceGuide.pdf or\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16779082",

Outcome-dependent dietary patterns provide insight into what foods may\nbe associated with the increased severity and progression of diabetes. However,\nthe ethnic and geographical heterogeneity of US Hispanic/Latino adults makes it\ndifficult to identify and distinguish differences within their diet as risk\nincreases. Supervised robust profile clustering (sRPC) is a flexible joint\nmodel that can identify dietary patterns associated with diabetes, while\npartitioning out those defined by their ethnicity and geography.

Using baseline dietary data (2008-2011) from the\nHispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, we illustrate the utility of\nour model to identify dietary patterns associated with the three-levels of\ndiabetes status (i.e. normal, pre-diabetes, diabetes). Simulation studies\nconfirmed that ordinal sRPC improved identification and characterization of\nthese patterns compared to a standard supervised latent class model.

This enables a more precise characterization of\nthe temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying\ndurations.

More specially, a\ncriterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the\nopen-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate\nelements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in\npattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves\nZadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.",

However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to\nlearn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause\ndue to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats\nclass-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,\nand a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is\ncapable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of\nmedical images.

Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and\nMuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods.

    "abstract": "The \"all-or-nothing\" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the\nTsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a\nlogical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is\ndisqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If\nsome literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the\noverall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause\neffectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,\nenabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed\nfuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory\nfootprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the\nIMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a\n50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM\ntrains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,\nenabling online learning on microcontrollers.

    "abstract": "The Rayleigh criterion has long served as a fundamental limit for the\nresolution of classical optical imaging. However, recent advances in quantum\nmetrology have led to the quantum superresolution technique that can break\nRayleigh's curse and estimate the separation between a pair of incoherent point\nsources with nonvanishing precision. For two-dimensional optical systems, the\nprecision limit of estimating the whole separation, i.e., the distance, between\ntwo point sources remains unknown so far. In this paper, we investigate the\nestimation precision of the distance between two incoherent point sources with\narbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging system. Through the\nmultiparameter quantum estimation theory, we obtain the ultimate estimation\nprecision of the distance and show that it remains nonzero when the distance\napproaches zero, which surpasses the Rayleigh criterion. We further show that\nthe precision can be enhanced by aligning the two point sources along specific\ndirections if the point-spread functions of the two sources are not circularly\nsymmetric, and find the optimial relative azimuth between the two point sources\nand the highest estimation precision of the distance. In addition to the\ndistance estimation, we also consider the quantum estimation of the relative\nazimuth between two incoherent point sources. A surprising result is that the\nprecision limit of the azimuth decays quadratically with the distance, which\nsuggests that the azimuth cannot be resolved when the two point sources get\nsufficiently close to each other and is therefore inaccessible by the quantum\nsuperresolution technique in this case. This reveals a new and fundamental\nlimitation on the resolvability of two incoherent point sources in\nmulti-dimensional quantum imaging which cannot be addressed by optimizing the\nquantum measurements.",

    "abstract": "Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum\ncomputation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by\nfully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the\nappropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by\nanalyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation\nalgorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and\nmanually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new\napproach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible\nframework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with\nappropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation\nto benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom\nmodels and parameter sets to drive the development of robust,\ntechnology-independent algorithms.

    "abstract": "Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) combines the advantages of\ndecentralized modeling and unlabeled representation learning, serving as a\ncutting-edge paradigm with strong potential for scalability and privacy\npreservation. Although FSSL has garnered increasing attention, research\nindicates that it remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing methods\ngenerally rely on visually obvious triggers, which makes it difficult to meet\nthe requirements for stealth and practicality in real-world deployment. In this\npaper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack method against\nFSSL, called IPBA. Our empirical study reveals that existing imperceptible\ntriggers face a series of challenges in FSSL, particularly limited\ntransferability, feature entanglement with augmented samples, and\nout-of-distribution properties. These issues collectively undermine the\neffectiveness and stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks in FSSL. To\novercome these challenges, IPBA decouples the feature distributions of backdoor\nand augmented samples, and introduces Sliced-Wasserstein distance to mitigate\nthe out-of-distribution properties of backdoor samples, thereby optimizing the\ntrigger generation process. Our experimental results on several FSSL scenarios\nand datasets show that IPBA significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack\nmethods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense\nmechanisms.",

However, the\nincreased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel\nsecurity challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised\nShared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In\nparticular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing\nsubtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used\nby traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These\nUnicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures\nin anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders,\nwhich are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate\nthe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN\narchitecture to address this challenge.

While initial detection accuracy\nrequires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to\nadversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use\ntheir adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy,\nalthough this requires further research.

In\nsurgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of\nsmocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model\nbias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based\nsaliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb\nto such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath\nsurgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.\nAvoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent\nassistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized\nworkflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff\nmembers. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud\nsequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from\nappearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and\ngeometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent\nsimulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic\nclinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This\nperformance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful\nbiometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of\nmodeling humans in the OR.",

This is motivated by applications\nin topological data analysis, since as a flag complex, the Dowker-Rips complex\nis less expensive to compute than the Dowker complex.

    "abstract": "We prove the $1$-dimensional flat chain conjecture in any complete and\nquasiconvex metric space, namely that metric $1$-currents can be approximated\nin mass by normal $1$-currents. The proof relies on a new Banach space\nisomorphism theorem, relating metric $1$-currents and their boundaries to the\nArens-Eells space. As a by-product, any metric $1$-current in a complete and\nseparable metric space can be represented as the integral superposition of\noriented $1$-rectifiable sets, thus dropping a finite dimensionality condition\nfrom previous results of Schioppa [Schioppa Adv. Math. 2016, Schioppa J. Funct.\nAnal. 2016]. The connection between the flat chain conjecture and the\nrepresentation result is provided by a structure theorem for metric\n$1$-currents in Banach spaces, showing that any such current can be realised as\nthe restriction to a Borel set of a boundaryless normal $1$-current. This\ngeneralizes, to any Banach space, the $1$-dimensional case of a recent result\nof Alberti-Marchese in Euclidean spaces [Alberti-Marchese 2023]. The argument\nof Alberti-Marchese requires the strict polyhedral approximation theorem of\nFederer for normal $1$-currents, which we obtain in Banach spaces.",

Researchers often need to use multiple analysis tools\nwritten in different programming languages while managing version conflicts\nbetween related packages within a single workflow.

Results: We present ShortCake, a containerized platform that\nintegrates a suite of single-cell analysis tools written in R and Python.\nShortCake isolates competing Python tools into separate virtual environments\nthat can be easily accessed within a Jupyter notebook. This enables users to\neffortlessly transition between various environments, including R, even within\na single notebook. Additionally, ShortCake offers multiple ``flavors,''\nenabling users to select container images tailored to their specific needs.\nShortCake provides a unified environment with fixed versions of various tools,\nthus streamlining workflows, reducing setup time, and improving\nreproducibility.

In this\npaper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where\ncommunication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of\nlong vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information\nsimultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique\nwith two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order\ngradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel\ninformation in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for\nadditional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove\nits impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices.

For this\nreason, little experimental information is available on the excited vibrational\nlevels of He$_2^+$. We report a measurement, by high-resolution photoelectron\nspectroscopy, of 17 vibrational levels of the $X^+$ $^2\\Sigma_u^+$ state of\n$^4$He$_2^+$, with vibrational quantum number $v^+$ from 3 to 19 and covering\nmore than 95% of the potential well.

Data-driven\nTSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine\nlearning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state\nestimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more\naccurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the\nfirst time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an\noperator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep\nneural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the\noriginal PI-DeepONet.

    "abstract": "\"Fedspeak\", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal\nReserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal\nOpen Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to\nshape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic\nconditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a\nhigh-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,\nalgorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose\nan LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and\nclassifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the\nsemantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate\ndomain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission\nmechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess\nthe confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification\naccuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis\ntask. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation\nbetween perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the\neffectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.",

With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated\nsearch agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans\nfrom this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such\n\"wide-context\" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated\ndue to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nWideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these\nlarge-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated\nquestions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,\ngrounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale\natomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange\nit into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline\nensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We\nbenchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including\nsingle-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most\nsystems achieve overall success rates near 0\\%, with the best performer\nreaching just 5\\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple\nhuman testers can achieve a near 100\\% success rate. These results demonstrate\nthat present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale\ninformation seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and\ndevelopment in agentic search.

Very low-mass\nstars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the\nextended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs.\nThe study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for\nunderstanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises\nto experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation\nsurveys such as Euclid or LSST.\n  Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a\nparadigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the\nvolume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual\nObservatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters\ninteroperability between astronomical archives around the world.

Finetuning with a small amount of real data further\nenhances transcription accuracy, improving over models trained exclusively on\nreal recordings. These results highlight the potential of procedurally\ngenerated audio for data-scarce music information retrieval tasks.",

Although video generation models offer cost-efficient\nsolutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect\nLoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental\nlimitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite\neffects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated\nlocations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces\nmajor challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial\nuncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating\nprompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of\nour framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts\n(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects\nwithin a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.\n(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the\ntext token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an\nIndependent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating\nthe control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted\nblending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset\nOmni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and\nFirst-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX\nevaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse\neffect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of\ndesired effects.",

Although there are increasing calls to include post-growth\nscenarios in high-level assessments, a coherent framework with what is required\nto model post-growth adequately remains absent. This article addresses this gap\nby: (1) identifying the minimum requirements for post-growth models, and (2)\nestablishing a set of model elements for representing specific policy themes.\nDrawing on a survey of modellers and on relevant post-growth literature, we\ndevelop a framework of minimum requirements for post-growth modelling that\nintegrates three spheres: biophysical, economic, and social, and links them to\npost-growth goals. Within the biophysical sphere, we argue that embeddedness\nrequires the inclusion of resource use and pollution, environmental limits, and\nfeedback mechanisms from the environment onto society. Within the economic\nsphere, models should disaggregate households, incorporate limits to\ntechnological change and decoupling, include different types of government\ninterventions, and calculate GDP or output endogenously. Within the social\nsphere, models should represent time use, material and non-material need\nsatisfiers, and the affordability of essential goods and services. Specific\npolicies and transformation scenarios require additional features, such as\nsectoral disaggregation or representation of the financial system.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent\nparadigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite the\nnotable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant\nchallenges remain to scale to complex multimodal workflows and adapt to dynamic\nworkloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related\nto controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies\nin orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require\ndynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce\nWeChat-YATT Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat, a simple, scalable, and\nbalanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these\nchallenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that\nenables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,\neffectively mitigating bottlenecks associated with centralized controller\narchitectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In\naddition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions\ncomputational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing\nhardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training\nconditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across diverse experimental scenarios,\ndemonstrating its substantial throughput improvements over state-of-the-art\nRLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been successfully\ndeployed to train models that support WeChat product features for a large-scale\nuser base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world\napplications.

These limitations manifest as two key challenges:\npervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or\nmisleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the\nunderutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance\nquery precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the\nretrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose\nWebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and\nfilters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering\nmechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both\nquery formulation and retrieval outcomes.

    "abstract": "Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands\nextensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in\nreducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically\ngenerated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge\nof domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert\npreferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are\ninsufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.\nTo address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on\nrelated work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an\nexemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates\nclassical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.\nInstead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation\ninto fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further\naugmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual\nguidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our\nframework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate\nbetter post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better\naccessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with\nproprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight\nLLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the\nquality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to\nstandard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and\nbears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe\nthat generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation\nconstraints of a suitable related work section.

    "abstract": "Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),\nmultiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge\ndeterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and\nneuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting\npredictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that\ntransforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and\nLaplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and\nemploys quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum\neigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct\nserves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis\nof neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we\npropose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM)\nmetals that can achieve tri-state switching, in which the FE polarization, spin\nsplitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE\nswitching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal\nwith FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe5GeTe2-a van der Waals metal with\nintrinsic magnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE\ntransition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer\nsliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lift the\nspin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic\nmoment and strong linear ME coupling. The interplay between metallicity and FE\nFiM gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi\nlevel, all of which can be fully electrically controlled by FE switching\nwithout reorienting the N\\'{e}el order. Our results establish sliding FE metals\nwith FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed,\nand low-dissipation spintronic devices.",

The underlying\nworkshop purpose was to steward the community towards a more practical mission\ndesign approach that will enable the development of this mission, as well as\nfuture missions, on a shorter cadence by setting expectations and having\ndifficult discussions early in development.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.\nHowever, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model\ntraining, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we\npropose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework\nspecifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation\napproaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to\nnoisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.\nCrucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation\nof the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning\nobjective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising\nspaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also\ntheoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under\ngeneral transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on\nmultiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with\nresults demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines.\nNotably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios,\nsuch as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable\nconvergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data\naugmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under\ncertain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically\ncombined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional\nperformance gains.",

    "abstract": "Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based\non a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained\nattention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize\ntarget moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer\nfrom semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the\nsame semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are\nfragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that\naligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions\nfor localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.\nFurthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive\ninferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \\textit{TAG}, a simple\nyet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,\nwhich incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and\nsimilarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal\ncontext of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without\ntraining.

Firstly, we leverage\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed\nprompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including\nimage captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex\ncaption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object\ncounting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that\nextracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1\nthen formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired\nwith preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises\n13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and\ndiverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the\ndataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the\nsuperior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations.

However,\ncovariates are often inherently non-scalar, taking multiple values for each\nobservation of the response. They can sometimes have a temporal structure,\ne.g., a time series of temperatures, or a spatial structure, e.g., multiple\nsoil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or selectively\nsummarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the use of\nstandard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be problematic and\ninformation is necessarily lost. Naively including all $p$ components of a\nvector-valued covariate as $p$ separate covariates, say, without recognizing\nthe structure, can lead to problems of multicollinearity, data sets that are\nexcessively wide given the sample size, and difficulty extracting the primary\nsignal provided by the covariate.

We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the\nwell-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet\nSearcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured\nactivity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work.\nMethods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas\nwere selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent\nWidths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this\nwork. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller\nactivity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to\nthe QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar\nactivity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through\nsimple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally,\nour investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca\nii H & K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused\nby assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases.\nConclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited\nto serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the\nvisible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our\nrecommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the\nobservations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...",

Recent memory-based methods enable efficient\nonline reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand\nDilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the\nlong-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity\ndetail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing\nmethods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static\nstructures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To\naddress this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the\nmodeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we\ndesign a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)\nfocuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling\naccurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent\nStructure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,\nensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.\nBy alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously\nmaintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic\nelements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while\nmaintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.",

In the presence of axions and Kerr\ngeometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type\nanomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions.\nDepending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous\nterms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS\nterms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled\nsqueezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\\omega$-effect.",

Most existing video matting datasets provide only\nhuman-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be\ncomposited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the\ngeneralization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is\ntypically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two\nperspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by\npursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also\ndevelop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse\nhuman bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a\n3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting\napproach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video\ndiffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong\npriors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and\nreal-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video\nmatting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal\ninformation, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong\ntemporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across\nthree benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,\nand present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,\nillustrating the strong generalization capability of our method.

    "abstract": "Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation\nby advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current\ndata-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality\nlabeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data\nscience. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to\naddress the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic\nGaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of\nsurgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue\nbackgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address\nchallenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.\nAdditionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically\ngenerating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a\nnew dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion\nand tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using\nthis dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground\ntruth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.\nExperimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic\nlabeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural\nnetworks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image\ndataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic\nimages generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with\nstate-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall\nimprovement in model performances by nearly 15%.",

In a semiconductor laser, squeezing\nto below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity\nand it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to\nsqueezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but\noften the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier.\nAt the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a\nquantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise\nsqueezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise\nin the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this\ncondition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when\nthe quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the\npulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\\pi} increase in pulse area.

    "abstract": "A new class of Wireless Sensor Network has emerged whereby multiple nodes\ntransmit data simultaneously, exploiting constructive interference to enable\ndata collection frameworks with low energy usage and latency. This paper\npresents STAIR (Spatio-Temporal Activation for Intelligent Relaying), a\nscalable, resilient framework for Wireless Sensor Networks that leverages\nconstructive interference and operates effectively under stringent resource\nconstraints. Using constructive interference requires all nodes to transmit the\nsame packet at the same time, thus, only one source node can send data per time\nslot. STAIR uses coarse-grained topology information to flood a selected subset\nof the network, relaying sensor readings from individual nodes during their\nallocated time slots. A submodular optimisation algorithm with proven quality\nbounds determines near-optimal sensor activation locations and times, aiming to\nminimise the sum of mean squared prediction errors from a multiple multivariate\nlinear regression model, which is used to estimate values at unselected\nlocations and times. This framework has been extensively validated on a\nreal-world testbed deployment.",

However, most of these methods rely on\ndedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,\nresulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across\ndifferent restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we\npropose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that\nleverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather\ndegradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of\na pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts\nacross tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general\nrestoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation\nvia trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts\nin a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to\ncapture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose\ncontrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task\nrelatedness.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using\na shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with\ndistillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since\naffordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models\nprimarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific\npatterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move\nbeyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and\npixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at\nboth the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available\ninformation. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both\negocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by\nleveraging CLIP.

Although this improves\nvisual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image\ntokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly\nincrease inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this\nissue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These\nmethods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most\nof them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context\nlearning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.\nRedundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain\nadaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in\nthis setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need\nfor new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning\n(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP\nconsists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for\nthe complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing\n77.8\\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\\%\nover the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all\nbaselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by\nachieving an average reduction of 10.78\\% in inference latency. CATP enhances\nthe practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future\nprogress in interleaved image-text scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered heliconical ferroelectric nematic (NTBF) phase is a\nunique example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a proper\nferroelectric fluid. In this study, we investigate four homologous series of\nmesogenic compounds, differing in the degree of fluorination of the mesogenic\ncore and bearing lateral alkoxy substituents of varying lengths, to understand\nhow molecular architecture influences the formation and stability of the NTBF\nphase. Increasing the length of the lateral chain lowers the phase transition\ntemperatures and suppresses smectic layer formation, enabling the emergence of\nthe NTBF phase which replaces the orthogonal ferroelectric smectic A (SmAF)\nphase. This indicates a competition between lamellar and heliconical polar\nordering, driven by the interplay of strong molecular dipoles and the\nself-segregation of chemically incompatible molecular segments that typically\nfavor layered structures. Notably, the NTBF phase in these compounds exhibits\nexceptionally short helical pitch lengths, on the order of a few hundred\nnanometers, as revealed by selective light reflection and atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM). Furthermore, for one of the studied compounds AFM imaging of\none compound revealed a regular array of screw dislocations within the NTBF\nphase, suggesting a possible link to more complex modulated or\ntwist-grain-boundary-like structures.",

At each\ntime slot, a controller decides whether to sample the environment and if so\nwhether to transmit a raw or processed sample, to the controller. Processing\nimproves transmission reliability over an unreliable wireless channel, but\nincurs an additional cost. The objective is to minimize the long-term average\nage of information (AoI), subject to constraints on the costs incurred at the\nsource and the cost of actuation error (CAE), a semantic metric that assigns\ndifferent penalties to different actuation errors. Although reducing AoI can\npotentially help reduce CAE, optimizing AoI alone is insufficient, as it\noverlooks the evolution of the underlying process. For instance, faster source\ndynamics lead to higher CAE for the same average AoI, and different AoI\ntrajectories can result in markedly different CAE under identical average AoI.\nTo address this, we propose a stationary randomized policy that achieves an\naverage AoI within a bounded multiplicative factor of the optimal among all\nfeasible policies. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to\ncharacterize system behavior under a range of parameters. These results offer\ninsights into the feasibility of the optimization problem, the structure of\nnear-optimal actions, and the fundamental trade-offs between AoI, CAE, and the\ncosts involved.",

We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,\nmanifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,\nlimited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term\nsequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained\ncontrol over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present\nBeing-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our\napproach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human\nmotion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion\nsequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed\npart-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We\nintroduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion\ntokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts\nduring generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's\nsuperior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive\nefficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities.

Training utilised over 800,000 minutes of physiologically\nrealistic, synthetically corrupted CTGs derived from expert-verified \"clean\"\nrecordings.

We\npresent results of hydrodynamical simulations with various codes and numerical\nmethods, using either barycentric or stellocentric reference frames, with or\nwithout the disc's self gravity: all simulations consistently show an unstable\nmode growing exponentially.\n  The instability disappears if, and only if, the reflex motion of the star due\nto the disc's asymmetry is not taken into account in the simulations.

This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,\nresulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given\ntrace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem\nand show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is\nbounded. We then identify a tractable fragment: in the absence of nested\nposting, where handlers do not post new messages while processing a message,\nconsistency checking can be performed in polynomial time. Finally, we implement\nour approach in a prototype tool and report on experimental results on a wide\nrange of benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable\nlaboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range\ninteracting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate\ninteractions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay\nof photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations.\nControl of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms\nat play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective\ntheoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field\nis treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly\nperturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective\nLindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of\npolarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to\nthe cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large\nintracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime\nand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field\nseed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical\ndescription by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature\ninterval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to\nstrong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework\nfor the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits,\namongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with\na versatile experimental platform.",

Instead of uniformly distributing neural features\nthroughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh\nvertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured\nrepresentation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory\nefficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with\nthe surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural\nrepresentation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis\non neural radiosity.

Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel\npretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve\ncrucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.\nFurthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare\nprediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our\nmethod. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert\nperformance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability.

    "abstract": "We performed the spectral and temporal analysis of MAXI J1803-298 using\nAstroSat/LAXPC and NICER observations taken in May 2021 during the initial\nphase of the outburst. We found that the source traverses through the hard,\nintermediate, and soft spectral states during the outburst. The spectrum in all\nstates can be described using soft emissions from the thermal disk and hard\nemissions from the coronal regions. The variation in the inner disk temperature\nand normalization of the disk indicates the motion of the truncated disk across\nthese different spectral states. We confirmed the presence of broad features,\nType-C, and Type-B QPOs in the power spectra of different spectral states. We\ninvestigated the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and\ndiscovered that the lag swung between positive and negative during the outburst\nevolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers\nvariations in accretion parameters such as the accretion rate, heating rate,\nand inner disk radius, along with delays between them, we found a dynamic\nreversal in the origin of variability between the corona and the disk.\nFurthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study\nconducted on this source during its outburst.",

However,\nexisting methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained\nsubtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking\nthe ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,\nfailing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,\nthis paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via\nbiologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's\n\"where-what\" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an\nenvironment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object\nfunctions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain\ntransfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill\nlearning module for task execution, which processes self-state information\nincluding joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill\ntransfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes.

In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,\ndifficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a\nflexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.\nHowever, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and\nstability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To\naddress these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft\nattitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven\napproaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on\nsimulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator.

These\nadvantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into\nan MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely\ndata-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding\nimprovements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased\nrobustness-to-noise.",

    "abstract": "Affective tactile interaction constitutes a fundamental component of human\ncommunication. In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced\nin isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only\nperceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying\nauditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory\ninformation forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While\nextensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial\nexpressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and\nemotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we\ndeveloped a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25\nvibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver\ncombined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese\nparticipants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through\nvibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on\narousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined\nhaptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to\nsingle modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively\nsupported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on\nthe emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient\nfor conveying clearly distinguishable emotions. These findings underscore the\nimportance of multisensory integration in affective human-robot interaction and\nhighlight the complementary roles of haptic and auditory cues in enhancing\nemotional communication.",

The core assumption of Material\nFingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected\nto a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the\nmaterial's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all\npertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics.\nConsequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and\ntheir corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly\ncharacterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by\nmeasuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to\nidentify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we\nexplore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating\nthe applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental\nsetups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments\ninvolving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress\ndata pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly\nshaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect\ndisplacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases,\nMaterial Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the\nchallenges of potentially non-convex optimization.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in auditory intelligence has yielded high-performing systems\nfor sound event detection (SED), acoustic scene classification (ASC), automated\naudio captioning (AAC), and audio question answering (AQA). Yet these tasks\nremain largely constrained to surface-level recognition-capturing what happened\nbut not why, what it implies, or how it unfolds in context. I propose a\nconceptual reframing of auditory intelligence as a layered, situated process\nthat encompasses perception, reasoning, and interaction. To instantiate this\nview, I introduce four cognitively inspired task paradigms-ASPIRE, SODA, AUX,\nand AUGMENT-those structure auditory understanding across time-frequency\npattern captioning, hierarchical event/scene description, causal explanation,\nand goal-driven interpretation, respectively. Together, these paradigms provide\na roadmap toward more generalizable, explainable, and human-aligned auditory\nintelligence, and are intended to catalyze a broader discussion of what it\nmeans for machines to understand sound.",

In this paper, we\ninvestigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having\nexpert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as\ndirect alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both\nindividual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized\ndomains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ndiscussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are\ntasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and\njustifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate\nreasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our\nempirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time\ntechniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal\nor even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting\ntheir broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate\nstatistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most\nsettings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited\nbenefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model\nbehaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment.

In contrast to the classic\nmodel of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation\ntransition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by\npushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing\nability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of\na rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the\nBalagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival\nprobability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits\nstretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average\ntrap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the\nclassical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density\n$\\rho_* \\approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping\nregimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes\ndynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping\nregime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement\nof obstacles.",

When an item arrives, we need\nto immediately and irrevocably place it into an empty cell. The goal is to\nminimize the sum of absolute differences between adjacent items, which is\ncalled the \\emph{cost} of the algorithm. It has been shown by Aamand,\nAbrahamsen, Beretta, and Kleist (SODA 2023) that when the stream\n$x_1,\\dots,x_n$ is generated adversarially, the optimal cost bound for any\ndeterministic algorithm is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$.\n  In this paper, we study the stochastic version of online sorting, where the\ninput items $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ are sampled uniformly at random. Despite the\nintuition that the stochastic version should yield much better cost bounds, the\nprevious best algorithm for stochastic online sorting by Abrahamsen, Bercea,\nBeretta, Klausen and Kozma (ESA 2024) only achieves $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ cost,\nwhich seems far from optimal. We show that stochastic online sorting indeed\nallows for much more efficient algorithms, by presenting an algorithm that\nachieves expected cost $\\log n\\cdot 2^{O(\\log^* n)}$.

In this study,\nwe present a novel deep learning-based framework for direct parcellation based\non the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas using only diffusion MRI data. Our method\nutilizes a hierarchical, two-stage segmentation network: the first stage\nperforms coarse parcellation into broad brain regions, and the second stage\nrefines the segmentation to delineate more detailed subregions within each\ncoarse category. We conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate various\ndiffusion-derived parameter maps, identifying an optimal combination of\nfractional anisotropy, trace, sphericity, and maximum eigenvalue that enhances\nparellation accuracy. When evaluated on the Human Connectome Project and\nConsortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics datasets, our approach achieves\nsuperior Dice Similarity Coefficients compared to existing state-of-the-art\nmodels. Additionally, our method demonstrates robust generalization across\ndifferent image resolutions and acquisition protocols, producing more\nhomogeneous parcellations as measured by the relative standard deviation within\nregions. This work represents a significant advancement in dMRI-based brain\nsegmentation, providing a precise, reliable, and registration-free solution\nthat is critical for improved structural connectivity and microstructural\nanalyses in both research and clinical applications. The implementation of our\nmethod is publicly available on github.com/xmindflow/DKParcellationdMRI.",

To handle this, we design a\nsemi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce\nlabeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised\nmultiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we\npseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth\nsimilarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,\nand train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity\nheatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module\ntrained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no\nground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of\nmodality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical\nindependence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across\noptical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we\ncompare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets.

While quantitative evaluations of compositional and\nnon-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative\nevaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic\nexpressions representing focus or emphasis such as \"it was John who left\". We\nfill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply\nto FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our\ncompositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of\nmodification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of\nUniversal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing\nsentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our\ncompositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis\nmethods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our\ncompositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER\nthat uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and\nmodification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates\ncompositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate\ndatasets to evaluate compositionality.

We conduct a comprehensive\nstudy on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the\ndense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for\nquality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while\ntraditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low\ncontrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and\ndrive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine\nbattery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world\nvisual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an\nintelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted\npre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate\nPBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed\nto extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,\nline, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination\nbetween plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state\nspace modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive\nrelationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware\nreordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.\nIn addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide\nrobust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode\npositions.

In HGNN inference, the\nneighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it\nsuffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly\nadopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results\nfor each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory\nexpansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory\naccesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics\nand repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood\noverlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN\ninference performance.\n  In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a\nvertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and\nredundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design\nTVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient\naggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on\ncross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce\nredundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that\nTVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU\nand the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing\nenergy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.",

However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,\nas their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these\ndefenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.\nThis means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their\nmodels, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense\nnot only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,\nwhich occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To\nachieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).\nBenefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the\nframework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.\nFirst, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a\npoisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an\nattacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to\nprevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus\nensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply\nwhen it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a\nstrong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active\ndefense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.",

    "abstract": "We study the blow-up dynamics for the $L^2$-critical focusing half-wave\nequation on the real line, a nonlocal dispersive PDE arising in various\nphysical models. As in other mass-critical models, the ground state solution\nbecomes a threshold between the global well-posedness and the existence of a\nblow-up. The first blow-up construction is due to Krieger, Lenzmann and\nRapha\\\"el, in which they constructed the minimal mass blow-up solution at the\nthreshold mass. In this paper, we construct finite-time blow-up solutions with\nmass slightly exceeding the threshold. This is inspired by similar results in\nthe mass-critical NLS by Bourgain and Wang, and their instability by Merle,\nRapha\\\"el and Szeftel. We exhibit a blow-up profile driven by the rescaled\nground state, with a decoupled dispersive radiation component. We rigorously\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of such solutions near the blow-up time,\nincluding sharp modulation dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\ninstability of these solutions by constructing non-blow-up solutions that are\narbitrarily close to the blow-up solutions. The main contribution of this work\nis to overcome the nonlocal setting of half-wave and to extend insights from\nthe mass-critical NLS to a setting lacking pseudo-conformal symmetry.",

To address these\nchallenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new\nperspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized\nactions.

Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more\nimportantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets.

In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning\nframework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through\na Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level\nimprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module\nprioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings\nand the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to\nless-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level\nmismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module\ndynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the\nvisual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level\nimprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were\nconducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the\neffectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world\napplications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting,\nobjectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus\ncreativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,\noptimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that\nfails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to\nthe MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a\npractical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse\nhuman values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI\ndeployments.",

Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text\nprompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept.

We train\nthe target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via\ncontrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of\nthe target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve\nconcept fidelity without overfitting.

    "abstract": "Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable\ngenerative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to\ndiffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference\ntimes, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped\nSpeculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR\nimage models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a\nmeans to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only\nmodest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis\nreveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image\ntokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can\nconvey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept\nonly a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,\nleading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a\nnew SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than\nrelying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static\nclustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our\ndynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image\nmodels by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without\nrequiring any additional training.

This technique provides a flexible and\nefficient alternative to traditional interpolation methods by approximating\ndata points without requiring the approximated function to pass exactly through\nthem. This approach is particularly valuable for handling jump discontinuities,\nwhere classical interpolation methods often fail due to the Gibbs phenomenon.\nThese discontinuities are common in practical scenarios such as signal\nprocessing and computational physics.

In this study, we present a combined experimental\nand simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically\nunderstand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed\nSource (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure\ncross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips\nat nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6\ninterconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct\nmultilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model,\nwhile areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the\nunderlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using\nCOMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric\nthermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations\nreveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the\nprimary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure\nplays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation\napproach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC\narchitectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in\nfuture high-performance 3D-stacked devices.",

To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped\nMixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the\npre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows\nin this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and\nintroduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by\nthe increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing\npolicy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically\nselects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task\ncollaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal\ncomprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize\nthe correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we\ndynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE\nadapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned\nknowledge.

One such successful effort,\nprimarily due to Martini and Wolf, introduced a theory of $\\infty$-categories\ninternal to the foundation of an arbitrary Grothendieck $\\infty$-topos, meaning\nthey used categorical foundations. Another approach, due to Riehl and Shulman,\ndeveloped a theory of $\\infty$-categories internal to their own type theory:\nsimplicial homotopy type theory (sHoTT), meaning they employed a (homotopy)\ntype theoretic foundation.\n  One aspect of developing a theory of $\\infty$-categories in different\nfoundations consists of introducing ways to translate from one foundation to\nanother. Concretely, as part of their work, Riehl and Shulman prove that\n$\\infty$-categories internal to Grothendieck $\\infty$-topoi give us categorical\nmodels of sHoTT. In fact the name ``simplicial'' in sHoTT suggests that all\ncategorical models of sHoTT should be given by simplicial objects in suitable\n$\\infty$-categories.

In order to better\ncomprehend the mathematical implications of homotopy type theory, a variety of\nmodels have been constructed and studied. Here a model is understood as a model\ncategory with suitable properties implementing the various type theoretical\nconstructors and axioms.

Atomistic spin dynamics or micromagnetics simulations could\nhelp unravel the links between these structures and resultant magnet\nperformance, but require input data describing the intrinsic magnetic\nproperties. Here, first-principles calculations based on density-functional\ntheory are used to determine these properties for two model interface\nstructures which have been derived from recently reported high resolution\nelectron microscopy images. One model structure is a stoichiometric twin formed\nby mirroring the RT\\textsubscript{12} structure in the (101) plane, and the\nother model structure is a ``stacking fault'' involving the insertion of a\nRT\\textsubscript{4} plane and a displacement along the [100] axis.

The interfaces modify the magnetic properties at the sub-nm scale.\nIn particular, in the R-rich region of the ``stacking fault'', the local easy\naxis of magnetization rotates by $49^\\circ$ from its bulk direction, which may\nlead to reduced coercivity through the easier nucleation of reverse domains.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nagents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms\nbaseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different\ncommunication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and\ncapacity limitations.",

It incorporates amplitude\nprior input, SNAKE-ConvNeXt v2 backbone and frequency-weighted anti-wrapping\nphase loss to compensate for the performance loss caused by the absence of GAN.\nExperimental results confirm that the speech quality of FreeGAN is comparable\nto that of advanced GAN-based vocoders, while significantly improving training\nefficiency and complexity. Other explicit-phase-prediction-based neural\nvocoders can also work without GAN, leveraging our proposed methods.",

Here, we report the observation and\ncontrol of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully\nconnected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from\nshort- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent\nmanipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states,\nelucidating their roles in QME.

In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches\nfrom tilted N\\'{e}el states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in\nintermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy\ndynamics reveal the suppression of QME.

Based on physical\nobservations and some elaborate analysis of this system's intrinsic symmetric\nhyperbolic-elliptic coupled structures, for a class of smooth initial data that\nare of small scaled density but possibly large mean velocity, we give one\nrigorous global-in-time convergence proof for regular solutions from M-D\nbipolar Euler-Poisson equations to M-D unipolar Euler-Poisson equations through\nthe infinity-ion mass limit. Here the initial scaled density is required to\ndecay to zero in the far field, and the spectrum of the Jacobi matrix of the\ninitial mean velocity are all positive. In order to deal with such kind of\nsingular limits, the global-in-time uniform tame estimates of regular solutions\nto M-D bipolar Euler-Poisson equations with respect to the ratio of electron\nmass over ion mass are established, based on which the corresponding error\nestimates in smooth function spaces between the two systems considered are also\ngiven. To achieve these, our main strategy is to regard the original problem\nfor M-D bipolar Euler-Poisson equations as the limit of a series of carefully\ndesigned approximate problems which have truncated convection operators and\ncompactly supported initial data. For such artificial problems, we can derive\ncareful a-priori estimates that are independent of the mass ratio, the size of\nthe initial data' supports and the truncation parameters.

We call this\nnode a ``Byzantine black hole (BBH)'' and at any given round it may choose to\ndestroy all visiting agents, or none. This subtle power can drastically\nundermine classical exploration strategies designed for an always active black\nhole. We study this perpetual exploration problem in the presence of at most\none BBH, without initial knowledge of the network size. Since the underlying\ngraph may be 1-connected, perpetual exploration of the entire graph may be\ninfeasible. We thus define two variants: \\pbmPerpExpl\\ and \\pbmPerpExplHome. In\nthe former, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of at least\none component, obtained after the exclusion of the BBH. In the latter, the\nagents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of the component which\ncontains the \\emph{home} node, where agents are initially co-located.\nNaturally, \\pbmPerpExplHome\\ is a special case of \\pbmPerpExpl. Agents operate\nunder a synchronous scheduler and communicate in a face-to-face model. Our goal\nis to determine the minimum number of agents necessary and sufficient to solve\nthese problems.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,\nmeteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the\ninterpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs\nfor temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded\nwithin self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to\neffectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM\nand reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing\ncomputational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance\nof our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

Among various host properties, gas-phase\nmetallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of\ntransients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host\ngalaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40\nhosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited\nsubsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate\n(SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in\nthe same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range\nin metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted\nmass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to\nthe earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on\nmetallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB\nproduction. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity,\nhigh-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter\ndistribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal\n($\\sim$2$\\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from\nthe fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed\nmass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that\nobserved in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase\nfollowing galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the\nstarburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed\ndelay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over\ncore-collapse supernovae.",

In this work, we focus on\nthe internal dynamics of systems governed by CBF-constrained control laws. Our\nkey observation is that, although CBFs guarantee safety by enforcing state\nconstraints, they can inadvertently be \"unsafe\" by causing the internal state\nto diverge. We investigate the conditions under which the full system state,\nincluding the internal state, can remain bounded under a CBF-based safety\nfilter. Drawing inspiration from the input-output linearization literature,\nwhere boundedness is ensured by minimum phase conditions, we propose a new set\nof CBF minimum phase conditions tailored to the structure imposed by the CBF\nconstraint. A critical distinction from the original minimum phase conditions\nis that the internal dynamics in our setting is driven by a nonnegative virtual\ncontrol input, which reflects the enforcement of the safety constraint.

    "abstract": "Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments\ncorresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for\nlong-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning\napproaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,\nthey fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality\nof the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose\nTimestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),\na novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning\nprocess to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors\nserve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each\nreasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby\nensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final\nprediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in\nmodels (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation\ntraining strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality\nreasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the\nSFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor\ngeneration while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable\nreasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.",

Previous\nreinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on\nstructured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a\ncomprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we\npropose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes\nLeveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis\ncontrol in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale\nlanguage models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic\nrepresentations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving\npatient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow\ndynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration\nof multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and\nMIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly\nimproves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to\nsingle-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM\ncapabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in\nmedical applications.

    "abstract": "Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and\ngalaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized\nregime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to\nachieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are\nstrongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for\nthe abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two\n$6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass\nresolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) and\nJiutian-1G ($3.7 \\times 10^{8}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified\nby HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF)\nconverges only for subhalos with $m_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but\ncan be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according\nto the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models.\nIncluding orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and\nvelocity distributions to $5$--$10\\%$ accuracy down to scales of\n$0.1$--$0.2\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to\ncosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation.\nConvergence below $0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires\nmore sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that\nredshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales\nbecause unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\\mathrm{p}} <\n0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\\mathrm{Mpc}$\nin redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for\nredshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures\nthat reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based\nstudies.",

Current models tend to prioritise\nalgorithmic complexity rather than incorporating neurophysiological insights\ninto force control, which is essential for developing effective neural\nengineering solutions. To address this, we propose EEGForceMap, an EEG-based\nmethodology that isolates signals from the premotor-parietal region and\nextracts task-specific components. We construct three distinct time-frequency\nfeature sets, which are validated by comparing them with prior studies, and use\nthem for force prediction with linear, non-linear, and deep learning-based\nregressors. The performance of these regressors was evaluated on the\nWAY-EEG-GAL dataset that includes 12 subjects. Our results show that\nintegrating EEGForceMap approach with regressor models yields a 61.7%\nimprovement in subject-specific conditions (R-squared = 0.815) and a 55.7%\nimprovement in subject-independent conditions (R-squared = 0.785) over the\nstate-of-the-art kinematic decoder models.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and\nfacilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.\nHowever, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's\nprivacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on\nthe privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop\ninteractions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being\ndesigned from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves\napproximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)\nanalysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while\nmaintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)\nbaselines and methods that account for social externalities.",

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be\nretrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one\npossible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the\nsemantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.\nSemantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic\nsimilarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:\none must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached\nresponses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities\nand serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing\nsemantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations\nand unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a\nprincipled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown\nquery and cost distributions.

    "abstract": "Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make\nit more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical\nvalues which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This\nis the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of\ndesigning AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This\nproblem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations\nrefer to \\emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)\nvalues and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a\ntreatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)\nincommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the\ntreatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible\nonly if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This\npaper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,\nwhich has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains\n(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph\nanalysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making\n(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be\nused to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec\nmethod is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary\ndecision-making.

    "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes\nlight-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing\nof synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier.\nHere, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum\nemitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical\nsolutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit,\nwe reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity\nenabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands.\nWhen coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters\nhybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau\npolaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable\nvia Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further\nexhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by\nnonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics\nwith quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool\nfor synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer,\nand controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for\napplications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.",

    "abstract": "With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the\nAutomatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime\ntraffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,\nanomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,\nexisting approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it\ndifficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series\nAIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series\nEncoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a\nCross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data\nand textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture\nenables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,\nanomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single\nend-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms\nexisting methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.\nFurthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation\nsummaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent\nand efficient maritime traffic management.",

Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal\ninteraction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context\nin cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on\nleveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for\ncross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample\nrelationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the\ncross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal\nretrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample\nmodality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference\ncontext to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a\ncontrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples\nand enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample\nand intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts,\nmodality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and\nsample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal\nretrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and\nsample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality.

    "abstract": "Fleets of autonomous robots are increasingly deployed alongside multiple\nhuman operators to explore unknown environments, identify salient features, and\nperform complex tasks in scenarios such as subterranean exploration,\nreconnaissance, and search-and-rescue missions. In these contexts,\ncommunication is often severely limited to short-range exchanges via ad-hoc\nnetworks, posing challenges to coordination. While recent studies have\naddressed multi-robot exploration under communication constraints, they largely\noverlook the essential role of human operators and their real-time interaction\nwith robotic teams. Operators may demand timely updates on the exploration\nprogress and robot status, reprioritize or cancel tasks dynamically, or request\nlive video feeds and control access. Conversely, robots may seek human\nconfirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or\nplanning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under\nrestricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for\nonline coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.\nMoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:\nspread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,\nmigrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining\nhigh-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links. These transitions are\nmanaged through distributed algorithms via only local communication. Extensive\nlarge-scale human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments validate the\nnecessity of incorporating human robot interactions and demonstrate that MoRoCo\nenables efficient, reliable coordination under limited communication, marking a\nsignificant step toward robust human-in-the-loop multi-robot autonomy in\nchallenging environments.",

To address this problem, we propose\ncollaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with\nnoisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed\nto integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers\n(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical\ncharacteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.\nThen, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss\ndistribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).\nAfterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted\nbased on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution\nalignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed\nlabels.

To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's\nability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we\ndesign a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates\nhigh-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level\nimaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions.\nAdditionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which\ncaptures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological\nrelationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better\nunderstand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout\nhybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs.

    "abstract": "Serverless computing has transformed cloud application deployment by\nintroducing a fine-grained, event-driven execution model that abstracts away\ninfrastructure management. Its on-demand nature makes it especially appealing\nfor latency-sensitive and bursty workloads. However, the cold start problem,\ni.e., where the platform incurs significant delay when provisioning new\ncontainers, remains the Achilles' heel of such platforms.\n  This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on\nModel Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving\nend-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller\njointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving\nlatency while minimizing resource overhead.\n  We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based\ntestbed. Experimental results using real-world function traces and synthetic\nworkloads demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 85% lower tail latency and a 34%\nreduction in resource usage.",

In this paper, we explore\nthe unconventional spin Hall conductivity (USHC) in three prototypical\naltermagnets -- RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe -- and elucidate how distinct magnetic\nand crystal symmetries modulate their spin Hall responses. RuO$_2$ exhibits\nonly trivial USHC contributions under a tilted geometry, demonstrating that\nsymmetry projections alone can induce apparent unconventional elements. In\ncontrast, CrSb and MnTe manifest robust, symmetry-driven USHC without\nstructural tilts, enabled by easy-axis orientations that reduce magnetic\nsymmetry. Through extensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the\ncomplementary roles of the time-reversal-even and time-reversal-odd components\nin determining the overall SHC. Our findings indicate that controlling the\ninterplay between crystal and magnetic symmetry -- for instance, by epitaxial\nstrain or doping -- can provide an experimental avenue to tune USHC magnitudes\nand directions in altermagnets.

While\ncollecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and\nscalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle\nwith the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In\nthis paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first\nderive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a\nkey Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference\nconflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it\nto formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our\nprinciple advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by\nthe most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality\nof this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the\nselection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical\nmethods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our\nPD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying\nconflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%\nrelative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a\nstronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting\ntraining efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference\nannotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained\npreference signals.",

    "abstract": "Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input\nvariable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods\nhave been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains\nunresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the\nactual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We\nsummarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)\nTheoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among\nmethods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,\nclarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,\nrigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a\ncomprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen\ntheoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution\nmethods.

Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)\nunder well-accepted computational hardness assumptions.

Rather than establishing distributional\nassumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is\ntractable, we view this as a more general \"tilting\" problem of biasing a\ndistribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one\ncan tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the\nposterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher\ndivergence.

However, they either utilize web data that differs from\nrobotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future\nframes at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under\ninsufficient robot data.

To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action\nvideos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,\nenabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human\nhand keypoints.

Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the\nreliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and\nout-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition\nmethod called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty\nestimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the\nresults from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the\ntrusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the\nreliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and\ntrusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted\nAcc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The\nproposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the\nmodel with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The\nextensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,\nachieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other\nmethods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511\nand 0.9035, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial\nlayout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,\nstate-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial\nprior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or\nmisclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,\nwe propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the\nspatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in\negocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually\nannotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts\ncorrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our\napproach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as\na post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and\nRT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning\nsignificantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.\nThis method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial\nstructure to improve reliability in object detection systems.",

This paper\nasks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of\nprocedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates\nthe outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image\ndepicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and\nthe specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,\ntemperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF\nrecurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that\nrefines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method\nleverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D\nrepresentations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA\naccurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme\nleads to a 22.18\\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk.

First, we introduce the concept\nof counting martingales and use it to define counting measures, counting\ndimensions, and counting strong dimensions. Second, we apply these new tools to\nstrengthen previous circuit lower bounds.\n  Resource-bounded measure and dimension have traditionally focused on\ndeterministic time and space bounds. We use counting complexity classes to\ndevelop resource-bounded counting measures and dimensions. Counting martingales\nare constructed using functions from the #P, SpanP, and GapP complexity\nclasses. We show that counting martingales capture many martingale\nconstructions in complexity theory. The resulting counting measures and\ndimensions are intermediate in power between the standard time-bounded and\nspace-bounded notions, enabling finer-grained analysis where space-bounded\nmeasures are known, but time-bounded measures remain open. For example, we show\nthat BPP has #P-dimension 0 and BQP has GapP-dimension 0.\n  As our main application, we improve circuit-size lower bounds. Lutz (1992)\nstrengthened Shannon's classic $(1-\\epsilon)\\frac{2^n}{n}$ lower bound (1949)\nto PSPACE-measure, showing that almost all problems require circuits of size\n$\\frac{2^n}{n}\\left(1+\\frac{\\alpha \\log n}{n}\\right)$, for any $\\alpha < 1$. We\nextend this result to SpanP-measure, with a proof that uses a connection\nthrough the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) to construct a counting\nmartingale. Our results imply that the stronger lower bound holds within the\nthird level of the exponential-time hierarchy, whereas previously, it was only\nknown in ESPACE. We study the #P-dimension of classical circuit complexity\nclasses and the GapP-dimension of quantum circuit complexity classes. We also\nshow that if one-way functions exist, then #P-dimension is strictly more\npowerful than P-dimension.",

In this\nstudy, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in\ndental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation\n(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image\nover an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the\npatient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction\nis performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior\nimage is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the\nmeasured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected\nprojection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process\nwithin the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading\nto improved CBCT image quality.",

These\ninaccuracies, combined with automation bias, where humans overrely on AI\npredictions, can result in worse decisions. Selective prediction, in which\npotentially unreliable model predictions are hidden from users, has been\nproposed as a solution. This approach assumes that when AI abstains and informs\nthe user so, humans make decisions as they would without AI involvement. To\ntest this assumption, we study the effects of selective prediction on human\ndecisions in a clinical context. We conducted a user study of 259 clinicians\ntasked with diagnosing and treating hospitalized patients. We compared their\nbaseline performance without any AI involvement to their AI-assisted accuracy\nwith and without selective prediction. Our findings indicate that selective\nprediction mitigates the negative effects of inaccurate AI in terms of decision\naccuracy. Compared to no AI assistance, clinician accuracy declined when shown\ninaccurate AI predictions (66% [95% CI: 56%-75%] vs. 56% [95% CI: 46%-66%]),\nbut recovered under selective prediction (64% [95% CI: 54%-73%]). However,\nwhile selective prediction nearly maintains overall accuracy, our results\nsuggest that it alters patterns of mistakes: when informed the AI abstains,\nclinicians underdiagnose (18% increase in missed diagnoses) and undertreat (35%\nincrease in missed treatments) compared to no AI input at all.

Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model.

To further enhance correlation robustness, we adopt a threshold-based\nselection mechanism to filter out irrelevant or weakly correlated audio-visual\npairs.

However, existing FL\nframeworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and\nthe growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers\nfrom high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with\nlarge models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL\n(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this\nintroduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address\nthese issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model\naggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By\nallowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently\nof the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and\ncommunication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nSHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in\nboth IID and non-IID settings.

The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity\ninformation inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion\ntransformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,\nunlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing\nDiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states\nby weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This\nalleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture\ndistinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive\nmodule is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video\ndecoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting\ntheir long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,\nthereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,\nLaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/ssugarwh/LaVieID.",

While existing detection\nsystems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they\ntypically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and\nminimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders\ntheir usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for\nnon-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to\nExplanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,\nand narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable\nand accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a\ndeepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual\ncaptioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated\nregions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We\ninstantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse\ndeepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves\ncompetitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations\naligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a\ncoherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to\ninterpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy\nand transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become increasingly ubiquitous in daily life. While\ntraditional recommendation approaches primarily rely on ID-based\nrepresentations or item-side content features, they often fall short in\ncapturing the underlying semantics aligned with user preferences (e.g.,\nrecommendation reasons for items), leading to a semantic-collaborative gap.\nRecently emerged LLM-based feature extraction approaches also face a key\nchallenge: how to ensure that LLMs possess recommendation-aligned reasoning\ncapabilities and can generate accurate, personalized reasons to mitigate the\nsemantic-collaborative gap. To address these issues, we propose a novel Content\nUnderstanding from a Collaborative Perspective framework (CURec), which\ngenerates collaborative-aligned content features for more comprehensive\nrecommendations. \\method first aligns the LLM with recommendation objectives\nthrough pretraining, equipping it with instruction-following and\nchain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Next, we design a reward model\ninspired by traditional recommendation architectures to evaluate the quality of\nthe recommendation reasons generated by the LLM. Finally, using the reward\nsignals, CURec fine-tunes the LLM through RL and corrects the generated reasons\nto ensure their accuracy. The corrected reasons are then integrated into a\ndownstream recommender model to enhance comprehensibility and recommendation\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of CURec over existing methods.",

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information\ntransmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional\nreinforcement learning methods.",

Here, we investigate the role of the FDT\nin the spin switching in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$\nusing a computational approach. Our results foresee that the spin switching in\nthe presence of the FDT requires less THz magnetic fields than the spin\nswitching without the FDT. Without the FDT terms, the spin switching in the\nconsidered system requires an extremely high magnetic field. Furthermore, we\ncompute the switching and non-switching contour diagrams to show that the FDT\ntremendously enhances the possibility of spin switching. These results not only\nshed light on the significance of the FDT in magnetization switching but also\nsuggest materials where the switching effect is pronounced.",

    "abstract": "A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the\nfollowing: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector\nfield, the generated samples appear to shift \\emph{along} the support of the\ndata distribution but not \\emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate\nthis phenomenon of \\emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical\nsystems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our\nperturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal\nlearning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target\ndensity only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.\nFurther, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the\nsupport? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive\ninfinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the\nboundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient\ncondition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.\nMoreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for\nrobust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the\ntangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation\nanalysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements\nand extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative\nmodels from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty\nquantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical\ngenerative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative\nmodels, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the\nmanifold hypothesis.",

The measures of forecast\nuncertainty are relatively easy to calculate and meet several important\ncriteria used by demographers who routinely generate population forecasts. This\npaper applies the uncertainty measures to a population forecast based on the\nCohort-Component Method, which links the probabilistic world forecast\nuncertainty to demographic theory, an important consideration in developing\naccurate forecasts. We applied this approach to world population projections\nand compared the results to the Bayesian-based probabilistic world forecast\nproduced by the United Nations, which we found to be similar but with more\nuncertainty than found in the latter. We did a similar comparison in regard to\nsub-national probabilistic forecasts and found our results to be similar with\nBayesian-based uncertainty measures.

Each node is expected to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS)\nrequirements. However, achieving individual QoS requirements may interfere with\nother concurrent communications. Underwater nodes rely excessively on the\nrationality of other underwater nodes when guided by fully cooperative\napproaches, making it difficult to seek a trade-off between individual QoS and\nglobal fair-effective communications under imperfect conditions.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)\naddresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during\ninference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods\nexploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of\nlow-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to\nout-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical\nchallenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution\nshifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded\nadaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to\naccommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal\npredictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache\nEnhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively\nstoring high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by\ndynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and\niteratively refined using an exponential moving average and\nexploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise\ndecision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse\nvisual distributions.

Unlike basic online tools that just fill in templates,\nthis system understands the meaning behind the content and customizes the SOW\nto match the needs of the project. It also checks legal compliance and\nformatting so that users can trust the result. The system was tested using real\nbusiness examples. It was able to create a full SOW in under three minutes,\ncompared to several hours or days using manual methods. It also performed well\nin accuracy and quality, showing that it can reduce legal risks and save a lot\nof time. This solution shows how artificial intelligence can be used to support\nlegal and business professionals by taking care of routine work and helping\nthem focus on more important decisions. It's a step toward making legal\nprocesses smarter, faster, and more reliable.",

The quantum-corrected metric is obtained\nperturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity\nbetween the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal\nGauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this\nmetric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute\nthe associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular\nseparation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum\nhair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the\nnonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong\ndeflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the\nangular separation decreases. In addition, the role of quantum hair is\ndiscussed in the weak and strong naked singularities.

This fragmentation leads to redundant engineering\neffort, inconsistent performance, and limited extensibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce UniFlow, a unified framework that employs continuous\ngenerative modeling to tackle diverse speech front-end tasks in a shared latent\nspace. Specifically, UniFlow utilizes a waveform variational autoencoder (VAE)\nto learn a compact latent representation of raw audio, coupled with a Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) that predicts latent updates. To differentiate the speech\nprocessing task during the training, learnable condition embeddings indexed by\na task ID are employed to enable maximal parameter sharing while preserving\ntask-specific adaptability. To balance model performance and computational\nefficiency, we investigate and compare three generative objectives: denoising\ndiffusion, flow matching, and mean flow within the latent domain. We validate\nUniFlow on multiple public benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective\nclassification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --\nidentifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions\ncan close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking\nerrors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show\nthat uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or\ndeny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining\ncalibration audits with verifiable inference.\n  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,\nand safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make\naccurate predictions -- but also know when to say \"I do not know\".",

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nFineBadminton, a novel and large-scale dataset featuring a unique multi-level\nsemantic annotation hierarchy (Foundational Actions, Tactical Semantics, and\nDecision Evaluation) for comprehensive badminton understanding. The\nconstruction of FineBadminton is powered by an innovative annotation pipeline\nthat synergistically combines MLLM-generated proposals with human refinement.\nWe also present FBBench, a challenging benchmark derived from FineBadminton, to\nrigorously evaluate MLLMs on nuanced spatio-temporal reasoning and tactical\ncomprehension. Together, FineBadminton and FBBench provide a crucial ecosystem\nto catalyze research in fine-grained video understanding and advance the\ndevelopment of MLLMs in sports intelligence. Furthermore, we propose an\noptimized baseline approach incorporating Hit-Centric Keyframe Selection to\nfocus on pivotal moments and Coordinate-Guided Condensation to distill salient\nvisual information. The results on FBBench reveal that while current MLLMs\nstill face significant challenges in deep sports video analysis, our proposed\nstrategies nonetheless achieve substantial performance gains.

However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for\nintermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and\nlimited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to\nindependently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this\nstudy builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based\nevaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on\nFeature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted\nScoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative\nmetric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the\nquality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature\nMap Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining\nfeature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time\nquality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental\nresults on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation\nmodule into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a\n3.89 percent gain in NDS.

However, some real-world workloads in key/value stores, document\ndatabases, and graph databases exhibit significant variability in value\nlengths, which can lead to performance anomalies, particularly when popular\nrecords grow disproportionately large. Existing benchmarks fail to account for\nthis variability, leaving an important aspect of DBMS behavior underexplored.\n  In this paper, we address this gap by extending the Yahoo! Cloud Serving\nBenchmark (YCSB) to include an \"extend\" operation, which appends data to record\nfields, simulating the growth of values over time. Using this modified\nbenchmark, we have measured the performance of three popular DBMS backends:\nMongoDB, MariaDB with the InnoDB storage engine, and MariaDB with the MyRocks\nstorage engine. Our experiments alternate between extending values and\nexecuting query workloads, revealing significant performance differences driven\nby storage engine design and their handling of variable-sized values.\n  Our key contribution is the introduction of a novel benchmarking approach to\nevaluate the impact of growing value sizes and isolate the effect of querying\ndata with a distribution of data sizes from any cost associated with accessing\ndata after a history of updates. This highlights the need for more\nrepresentative benchmarks that capture the dynamic nature of real-world\nworkloads, providing valuable guidance for both practitioners and researchers.",

Different from the conventional seminumerical Hessian\nalgorithm, which requires gradients at $O(N_{\\mathrm{atom}})$ displaced\ngeometries (where $N_{\\mathrm{atom}}$ is the number of atoms), the present\napproach only requires $O(1)$ gradients. Key to the reduction of the number of\ngradients is the exploitation of the off-diagonal low-rank (ODLR) property of\nHessians, namely the blocks of the Hessian that correspond to two distant\ngroups of atoms have low rank. This property reduces the number of independent\nentries of the Hessian from $O(N_{\\mathrm{atom}}^2)$ to $O(N_{\\mathrm{atom}})$,\nsuch that $O(1)$ gradients already contain enough information to uniquely\ndetermine the Hessian.

The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)\nChallenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and\nComputer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate\nrule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of\nclinical DICOM images.

Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied\n- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text\nreplacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in\nstrict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of\nthe MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly\nexecuted 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that\ncompleted the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams).

While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention\nhas been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce\na high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes\nof low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on\ncharacter recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel\nstructure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.\nOur framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,\nleveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the\nintegrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and\nlayouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative\nspace of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a\nspecific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's\nstyle, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative\ninteraction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution\nstructure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.\nExperiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,\ncharacter-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes\nin degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular\nlayouts.

Metrics and stability theorems are established for these invariants.\nThe concept of symmetry types is formalized via the action of isometry groups\nin configuration spaces.

Ultra-cold\nneutrons (UCNs) are attractive for nnbar-osc searches because of their long\nstorage time, but earlier analyses indicated that phase shifts on wall\nreflection differ for neutron and antineutron, leading to severe decoherence\nand loss of sensitivity. Here we revisit this problem by numerically solving\nthe time-dependent Schroedinger equation for the two-component n/nbar wave\nfunction, explicitly including wall interactions. We show that decoherence can\nbe strongly suppressed by selecting a wall material whose neutron and\nantineutron optical potentials are nearly equal. Using coherent scattering\nlength data and estimates for antineutrons, we identify a Ni-Al alloy\ncomposition that matches the potentials within a few percent while providing a\nhigh absolute value, enabling long UCN storage. With such a bottle and an\nimproved UCN source, the sensitivity could reach an oscilla-tion period\ntau_nnbar of order 10^10 s, covering most of the range predicted by certain\ngrand-unified models.

    "abstract": "We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in\nthe expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the\nequation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact\nsolutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is\nembedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known\nMcVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends\non the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with\nthe expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or\nduring inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the\nsupermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes\nsuggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the\ncosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters\nthe epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour\nof black holes around different future singularities are carefully\ninvestigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the\ntidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended\nobject, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.\n  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside\nthe black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the\nspherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon,\nit becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the\nradius of the singularity becomes infinite.",

    "abstract": "Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit\nexceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for\nscalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions\nbetween qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin\nrelaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles\ncalculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock\ntransition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we\nquantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction,\nwhich serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these\nphonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield\nmaster equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature\ndependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe\nphonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic\nphonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the\nexperimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the\ncoherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by\none to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed\nby longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by\nmid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a\nquantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin\nqubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating\nspin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.",

We introduce Conversational DNA, a novel visual\nlanguage that treats any dialogue -- whether between humans, between human and\nAI, or among groups -- as a living system with interpretable structure that can\nbe visualized, compared, and understood. Unlike traditional conversation\nanalysis that reduces rich interaction to statistical summaries, our approach\nreveals the temporal architecture of dialogue through biological metaphors.\nLinguistic complexity flows through strand thickness, emotional trajectories\ncascade through color gradients, conversational relevance forms through\nconnecting elements, and topic coherence maintains structural integrity through\nhelical patterns. Through exploratory analysis of therapeutic conversations and\nhistorically significant human-AI dialogues, we demonstrate how this\nvisualization approach reveals interaction patterns that traditional methods\nmiss.

Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention\nmechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In\ncontrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates\ninput projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention\noperation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image\nbranches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing\nediting techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention\nmechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,\nrevealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a\nrobust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to\nlocal edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models.

    "abstract": "Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet\ntraditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they\nsurface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related\nideas.

We\nintroduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds\nfrom dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level\nthemes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention\neach topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than\nraw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization\nparameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user\nstudy comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155\ntranscripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device\nconcerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,\nBERTopic).
