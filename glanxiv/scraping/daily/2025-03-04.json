    "abstract": "Using language models to scalably approximate human preferences on text\nquality (LLM-as-a-judge) has become a standard practice applicable to many\ntasks. A judgment is often extracted from the judge's textual output alone,\ntypically with greedy decoding. However, LLM judges naturally provide\ndistributions over judgment tokens, inviting a breadth of inference methods for\nextracting fine-grained preferences. We find that taking the mean of the\njudgment distribution consistently outperforms taking the mode (i.e. greedy\ndecoding) in all evaluation settings (i.e. pointwise, pairwise, and listwise).\nWe further explore novel methods of deriving preferences from judgment\ndistributions, and find that methods incorporating risk aversion often improve\nperformance. Lastly, we analyze LLM-as-a-judge paired with chain-of-thought\n(CoT) prompting, showing that CoT can collapse the spread of the judgment\ndistribution, often harming performance. Our findings suggest leveraging\ndistributional output can improve LLM-as-a-judge, as opposed to using the text\ninterface alone.",

We propose three models that use the copula distribution\nfunction, copula density function and their mixed tensor product to produce\nnetworks.

Establishing this relationship forges a connection between the\nparameter of the copula and the frequency of subgraphs in the generated\nnetwork.

We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions\nprobed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398$-$3359. At 2000\nau scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5--10 micron\ncontinuum, whereas the submillimeter H$_2$CO emission traces two of the four\nshells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH,\nc-C$_3$H$_2$, and CH$_3$OH shows the same two shells, and the $^{12}$CO\nemission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a\ncondensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these\nlines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot\nH$_2$ gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H$_2$\nis 1147$\\pm$198 K within a 0\\farcs5 aperture at the protostar.

    "abstract": "The analysis of randomized controlled trials is often complicated by\nintercurrent events (ICEs) -- events that occur after treatment initiation and\naffect either the interpretation or existence of outcome measurements. Examples\ninclude treatment discontinuation or the use of additional medications. In two\nrecent clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus with complications of\nICEs, we classify the ICEs into two broad categories: treatment-related (e.g.,\ntreatment discontinuation due to adverse events or lack of efficacy) and\ntreatment-unrelated (e.g., treatment discontinuation due to external factors\nsuch as pandemics or relocation). To define a clinically meaningful estimand,\nwe adopt tailored strategies for each category of ICEs. For treatment-related\nICEs, which are often informative about a patient's outcome, we use the\ncomposite variable strategy that assigns an outcome value indicative of\ntreatment failure. For treatment-unrelated ICEs, we apply the hypothetical\nstrategy, assuming their timing is conditionally independent of the outcome\ngiven treatment and baseline covariates, and hypothesizing a scenario in which\nsuch events do not occur. A central yet previously overlooked challenge is the\npresence of competing ICEs, where the first ICE censors all subsequent ones.\nDespite its ubiquity in practice, this issue has not been explicitly recognized\nor addressed in previous data analyses due to the lack of rigorous statistical\nmethodology. In this paper, we propose a principled framework to formulate the\nestimand, establish its nonparametric identification and semiparametric\nestimation theory, and introduce weighting, outcome regression, and doubly\nrobust estimators. We apply our methods to analyze the two systemic lupus\nerythematosus trials, demonstrating the robustness and practical utility of the\nproposed framework.",

In the present\nstudy, we examine the applicability two methodologies previously used for\nhelical structures for the quantification of the chirality of molecular normal\nmodes across a range of small, not necessarily helical, molecules. The first\napproach involves the application of the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to\neach normal mode by associating the mode with a structure formed by imposing\nthe corresponding motion about a common origin. The second approach assigns to\neach normal mode a pseudoscalar defined as the product of atomic linear and\nangular momentum summed over all atoms. In particular, using the CCM also as a\nmeasure of the chirality of the underlying molecular structure, we establish\nthe existence of correlation between the chirality of molecular normal modes\nand that of the underlying molecular structure. Furthermore, we find that\nnormal modes associated with different frequency ranges of the molecular\nvibrational spectrum exhibit distinct handedness behavior.",

For block models with $n$ vertices and a fixed\nnumber of communities $q$, it was predicted in Decelle et al. (2011) that there\nare computationally efficient algorithms for recovering the communities above\nthe Kesten--Stigum (KS) bound and that efficient recovery is impossible below\nthe KS bound. This conjecture has since stimulated a lot of interest, with the\nachievability side proven in a line of research that culminated in the work of\nAbbe and Sandon (2018). Conversely, recent work by Sohn and Wein (2025)\nprovides evidence for the hardness part using the low-degree paradigm.\n  In this paper we investigate community recovery in the regime $q=q_n \\to\n\\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$ where no such predictions exist. We show that efficient\ninference of communities remains possible above the KS bound. Furthermore, we\nshow that recovery of block models is low-degree hard below the KS bound when\nthe number of communities satisfies $q\\ll \\sqrt{n}$. Perhaps surprisingly, we\nfind that when $q \\gg \\sqrt{n}$, there is an efficient algorithm based on\nnon-backtracking walks for recovery even below the KS bound. We identify a new\nthreshold and ask if it is the threshold for efficient recovery in this regime.\nFinally, we show that detection is easy and identify (up to a constant) the\ninformation-theoretic threshold for community recovery as the number of\ncommunities $q$ diverges.\n  Our low-degree hardness results also naturally have consequences for graphon\nestimation, improving results of Luo and Gao (2024).",

This task has long been challenging for robotics due to the large\nvariations in the geometry, size, and articulation types of such objects. Our\nsystem, Articubot, consists of three parts: generating a large number of\ndemonstrations in physics-based simulation, distilling all generated\ndemonstrations into a point cloud-based neural policy via imitation learning,\nand performing zero-shot sim2real transfer to real robotics systems. Utilizing\nsampling-based grasping and motion planning, our demonstration generalization\npipeline is fast and effective, generating a total of 42.3k demonstrations over\n322 training articulated objects. For policy learning, we propose a novel\nhierarchical policy representation, in which the high-level policy learns the\nsub-goal for the end-effector, and the low-level policy learns how to move the\nend-effector conditioned on the predicted goal. We demonstrate that this\nhierarchical approach achieves much better object-level generalization compared\nto the non-hierarchical version. We further propose a novel weighted\ndisplacement model for the high-level policy that grounds the prediction into\nthe existing 3D structure of the scene, outperforming alternative policy\nrepresentations. We show that our learned policy can zero-shot transfer to\nthree different real robot settings: a fixed table-top Franka arm across two\ndifferent labs, and an X-Arm on a mobile base, opening multiple unseen\narticulated objects across two labs, real lounges, and kitchens.

    "abstract": "This article provides a practical introduction to kernel discrepancies,\nfocusing on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), the Hilbert-Schmidt\nIndependence Criterion (HSIC), and the Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD). Various\nestimators for these discrepancies are presented, including the commonly-used\nV-statistics and U-statistics, as well as several forms of the more\ncomputationally-efficient incomplete U-statistics. The importance of the choice\nof kernel bandwidth is stressed, showing how it affects the behaviour of the\ndiscrepancy estimation. Adaptive estimators are introduced, which combine\nmultiple estimators with various kernels, addressing the problem of kernel\nselection.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language\nmodels with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards\ndeveloping RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models\nwithout requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning\nalgorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling\nand RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored.\nGiven the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we\ninvestigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on\nbehavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly\navailable RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform\ncorrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in\nthe preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the\nattacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference\ndataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This\nmanipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the\nmisalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack\ncan effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted\ndomains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities\nof RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the\nRLHF fine-tuning process.",

By learning to quantify the\nprobabilistic distribution of atmospheric states under observational,\npredictive, and external forcing constraints, GAP excels in a broad range of\nweather-climate related tasks, including data assimilation, seamless\nprediction, and climate simulation.

    "abstract": "The axion is a compelling hypothetical particle that could account for the\ndark matter in our universe, while simultaneously explaining why quark\ninteractions within the neutron do not appear to give rise to an electric\ndipole moment. The most sensitive axion detection technique in the 1 to 10 GHz\nfrequency range makes use of the axion-photon coupling and is called the axion\nhaloscope. Within a high Q cavity immersed in a strong magnetic field, axions\nare converted to microwave photons. As searches scan up in axion mass, towards\nthe parameter space favored by theoretical predictions, individual cavity sizes\ndecrease in order to achieve higher frequencies. This shrinking cavity volume\ntranslates directly to a loss in signal-to-noise, motivating the plan to\nreplace individual cavity detectors with arrays of cavities. When the\ntransition from one to (N) multiple cavities occurs, haloscope searches are\nanticipated to become much more complicated to operate: requiring N times as\nmany measurements but also the new requirement that N detectors function in\nlock step. To offset this anticipated increase in detector complexity, we aim\nto develop new tools for diagnosing low temperature RF experiments using neural\nnetworks for pattern recognition. Current haloscope experiments monitor the\nscattering parameters of their RF receiver for periodically measuring cavity\nquality factor and coupling. However off-resonant data remains relatively\nuseless. In this paper, we ask whether the off resonant information contained\nin these VNA scans could be used to diagnose equipment failures/anomalies and\nmeasure physical conditions (e.g., temperatures and ambient magnetic field\nstrengths).

    "abstract": "Privacy is an instance of a social norm formed through legal, technical, and\ncultural dimensions. Institutions such as regulators, industry, and researchers\nact as societal agents that both influence and respond to evolving norms.\nAttempts to promote privacy are often ineffective unless they account for this\ncomplexity and the dynamic interactions among these actors. Privacy enhancing\ntechnologies (PETs) are technical solutions for privacy issues that enable\ncollaborative data analysis, allowing for the development of solutions that\nbenefit society, all while ensuring the privacy of individuals whose data is\nbeing used. However, despite increased privacy challenges and a corresponding\nincrease in new regulations being proposed by governments across the globe, a\nlow adoption rate of PETs persists. In this work, we investigate the factors\ninfluencing industry's decision-making processes around PETs adoption as well\nas the extent to which privacy regulations inspire such adoption. We conducted\na qualitative survey study with 22 industry participants from across Canada to\ninvestigate how businesses in Canada make decisions to adopt novel technologies\nand how new privacy regulations impact their business processes. Informed by\nthe results of our analysis, we make recommendations for industry, researchers,\nand policymakers on how to support what each of them seeks from the other when\nattempting to improve digital privacy protections. By advancing our\nunderstanding of what challenges the industry faces, we increase the\neffectiveness of future privacy research that aims to help overcome these\nissues.",

This statement - proven by\na simple argument - has a bunch of consequences: first, the\nRiemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm can be turned, with little modifications and no\npenalty in complexity, into a unified, provably stable algorithm for the\ncomputation of phase factors in any QSP variant, including GQSP.

Low-rank OT achieves linear\ncomplexity, but by definition, cannot compute a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween points. When the optimal transport problem is an assignment problem\nbetween datasets then an optimal mapping, known as the Monge map, is guaranteed\nto be a bijection. In this setting, we show that the factors of an optimal\nlow-rank coupling co-cluster each point with its image under the Monge map.

FOMT employs a sparse collection of local tests,\nstrategically generated at random, to detect violations of monotonicity\nscattered throughout the domain of the regression function. This sparsity\nenables significant computational efficiency, achieving sublinear runtime in\nmost cases, and quasilinear runtime (i.e., linear up to a log factor) in the\nworst case. In contrast, existing statistically optimal tests typically require\nat least quadratic runtime. FOMT's statistical accuracy is achieved through the\nprecise calibration of these local tests and their effective combination,\nensuring both sensitivity to violations and control over false positives. More\nprecisely, we show that FOMT separates the null and alternative hypotheses at\nminimax optimal rates over H\\\"older function classes of smoothness order in\n$(0,2]$. Further, when the smoothness is unknown, we introduce an adaptive\nversion of FOMT, based on a modified Lepskii principle, which attains\nstatistical optimality and meanwhile maintains the same computational\ncomplexity as if the intrinsic smoothness were known.

We demonstrate that the resulting fully discrete scheme is stable when\nthe time-step size is upper bounded by a constant. More specifically, when\ncentral fluxes are used for the advection term, the schemes are stable under\nthe time-step constraint tau <= tau_0 * d / a^2, while when upwind fluxes are\nused, the schemes are stable if tau <= max{tau_0 * d / a^2, c_0 * h / a}. Here,\ntau is the time-step size, h is the spatial mesh size, and a and d are\nconstants for the advection and diffusion coefficients, respectively. The\nconstant c_0 is the CFL constant for the explicit RK method for the purely\nadvection equation, and tau_0 is a constant that depends on the order of the\nETD-RK method. These stability conditions are consistent with those of the\nimplicit-explicit RKDG method. The time-step constraints are rigorously proved\nfor the lowest-order case and are validated through Fourier analysis for\nhigher-order cases. Notably, the constant tau_0 in the fully discrete ETD-RKDG\nschemes appears to be determined by the stability condition of their\nsemi-discrete (continuous in space, discrete in time) ETD-RK counterparts and\nis insensitive to the polynomial degree and the specific choice of the DG\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a\nfundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation\nnetworks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by\nlog-normal distributions, yet they also display power-law behaviour in the\nhigh-citation regime, presenting an apparent contradiction that lacks a unified\nexplanation. Here, we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the\nvariance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law\nwith respect to time since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$. This discovery\nintroduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to\nresolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent\nattention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process incorporating\ncumulative advantage. This process is characterised by the Hurst parameter $H$,\nderived from fractional Brownian motion, and volatility. Our framework\nreconciles this contradiction by demonstrating that anti-persistent\nfluctuations ($H<\\tfrac{1}{2}$) give rise to log-normal citation distributions,\nwhereas persistent dynamics ($H>\\tfrac{1}{2}$) favour heavy-tailed power laws.\nNumerical simulations confirm our model's explanatory and predictive power,\ninterpolating between log-normal and power-law distributions while reproducing\nthe $t^{H}$ law. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints further supports our\ntheory, revealing an intrinsically anti-persistent nature with an upper bound\nof approximately $H=0.13$. By linking memory effects and stochastic\nfluctuations to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying\nframework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science\nand other attention-driven processes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art\ngenerative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as\npriors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally\nintegrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given\nlikelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms developed for\nthis purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown\nparameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior\ndistribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their\nperformance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. Motivated by this\nchallenge, this work introduces three benchmark problems for evaluating the\nperformance of diffusion model based samplers. The benchmark problems, which\nare inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase\nretrieval, have a posterior density that is analytically known. In this\nsetting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling\nprincipled evaluation of the performance of posterior sampling algorithms. This\nwork also introduces a general framework for diffusion model based posterior\nsampling, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing\n(BIPSDA). This framework unifies several recently proposed\ndiffusion-model-based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel\nalgorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design\nchoices. We tested the performance of a set of BIPSDA algorithms, including\npreviously proposed state-of-the-art approaches, on the proposed benchmark\nproblems. The results provide insight into the strengths and limitations of\nexisting diffusion-model based posterior samplers, while the benchmark problems\nprovide a testing ground for future algorithmic developments.",

We numerically show that the laser field\nplays a crucial role in this structure, as it completely suppresses Klein\ntunneling compared to the case without laser. Furthermore, in contrast to the\nHartman effect, the group delay time becomes dependent on the barrier width\nwith the appearance of additional peaks. This suggests that fermion-field\ninteractions cause additional delays within the barrier and also help to reduce\nspin coupling. Adding BN layers increases the interval of transmission\nsuppression and completely eliminates coupling after the addition of three BN\nlayers.

    "abstract": "The Pythagorean school attributed consonance in music to simplicity of\nfrequency ratios between musical tones. In the last two centuries, the\nconsonance curves developed by Helmholtz, Plompt and Levelt shifted focus to\npsycho-acoustic considerations in perceiving consonances. The appearance of\npeaks of these curves at the ratios considered by the Pythagorean school, and\nwhich were a consequence of an attempt to understand the world by nice\nmathematical proportions, remained a curiosity. This paper addresses this\ncuriosity, by describing a mathematical model of musical sound, along with a\nmathematical definition of consonance. First, we define pure, complex and mixed\ntones as mathematical models of musical sound. By a sequence of numerical\nexperiments and analytic calculations, we show that continuous cosine\nsimilarity, abbreviated as cosim, applied to these models quantifies the\nelusive concept of consonance as a frequency ratio which gives a local maximum\nof the cosim function. We prove that these maxima occur at the ratios\nconsidered as consonant in classical music theory. Moreover, we provide a\nsimple explanation why the number of musical intervals considered as consonant\nby musicians is finite, but has been increasing over the centuries.\nSpecifically, our formulas show that the number of consonant intervals changes\nwith the depth of the tone (the number of harmonics present).",

We look at four types of features, namely text, text metadata, tweet\nmetadata, and account features, which also help us understand the extent to\nwhich the user or the content helps predict the number of abusive replies.\nThis, in turn, helps us develop a model to support social media users in\nfinding the best way to post content.

    "abstract": "Dimension reduction is often necessary in functional data analysis, with\nfunctional principal component analysis being one of the most widely used\ntechniques. A key challenge in applying these methods is determining the number\nof eigen-pairs to retain, a problem known as order determination. When a\ncovariance function admits a finite representation, the challenge becomes\nestimating the rank of the associated covariance operator. While this problem\nis straightforward when the full trajectories of functional data are available,\nin practice, functional data are typically collected discretely and are subject\nto measurement error contamination. This contamination introduces a ridge to\nthe empirical covariance function, which obscures the true rank of the\ncovariance operator. We propose a novel procedure to identify the true rank of\nthe covariance operator by leveraging the information of eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions. By incorporating the nonparametric nature of functional data\nthrough smoothing techniques, the method is applicable to functional data\ncollected at random, subject-specific points. Extensive simulation studies\ndemonstrate the excellent performance of our approach across a wide range of\nsettings, outperforming commonly used information-criterion-based methods and\nmaintaining effectiveness even in high-noise scenarios. We further illustrate\nour method with two real-world data examples.",

    "abstract": "As educational settings increasingly integrate artificial intelligence (AI),\nunderstanding how AI tools identify -- and adapt their responses to -- varied\neducational contexts becomes paramount. This study examines conversational AI's\neffectiveness in supporting K-12 mathematics education across various\neducational contexts. Through qualitative content analysis, we identify\neducational contexts and key instructional needs present in educator prompts\nand assess AI's responsiveness. Our findings indicate that educators focus\ntheir AI conversations on assessment methods, how to set the cognitive demand\nlevel of their instruction, and strategies for making meaningful real-world\nconnections. However, educators' conversations with AI about instructional\npractices do vary across revealed educational contexts; they shift their\nemphasis to tailored, rigorous content that addresses their students' unique\nneeds. Educators often seek actionable guidance from AI and reject responses\nthat do not align with their inquiries. While AI can provide accurate,\nrelevant, and useful information when educational contexts or instructional\npractices are specified in conversation queries, its ability to consistently\nadapt responses along these evaluation dimensions varies across different\neducational settings. Significant work remains to realize the\nresponse-differentiating potential of conversational AI tools in complex\neducational use cases. This research contributes insights into developing AI\ntools that are responsive, proactive, and anticipatory, adapting to evolving\neducational needs before they are explicitly stated, and provides actionable\nrecommendations for both developers and educators to enhance AI integration in\neducational practices.",

Nonetheless, whether or not Transformers are efficient for\nthe tasks other than channel acquisition and how to reap the benefits of both\narchitectures are less understood. In this paper, we take learning precoding\npolicies in multi-user multi-antenna systems as an example to answer the\nquestions. We notice that a Transformer tailored for precoding can reflect\nmultiuser interference, which is essential for its generalizability to the\nnumber of users. Yet the tailored Transformer can only leverage partial\npermutation property of precoding policies and hence is not generalizable to\nthe number of antennas, same as a GNN learning over a homogeneous graph. To\nprovide useful insight, we establish the relation between Transformers and the\nGNNs that learn over heterogeneous graphs. Based on the relation, we propose\nGraph Transformers, namely 2D- and 3D-Gformers, for exploiting the permutation\nproperties of baseband precoding and hybrid precoding policies.

Despite these advancements, the increasing complexity and volume of\ngenomic data present significant challenges related to accuracy, scalability,\nand computational efficiency. These challenges are mainly due to various forms\nof unwanted and unhandled variations in sequencing data, collectively referred\nto as noise. In this dissertation, we address these challenges by providing a\ndeep understanding of different types of noise in genomic data and developing\ntechniques to mitigate the impact of noise on genome analysis.\n  First, we introduce BLEND, a noise-tolerant hashing mechanism that quickly\nidentifies both exactly matching and highly similar sequences with arbitrary\ndifferences using a single lookup of their hash values. Second, to enable\nscalable and accurate analysis of noisy raw nanopore signals, we propose\nRawHash, a novel mechanism that effectively reduces noise in raw nanopore\nsignals and enables accurate, real-time analysis by proposing the first\nhash-based similarity search technique for raw nanopore signals. Third, we\nextend the capabilities of RawHash with RawHash2, an improved mechanism that 1)\nprovides a better understanding of noise in raw nanopore signals to reduce it\nmore effectively and 2) improves the robustness of mapping decisions. Fourth,\nwe explore the broader implications and new applications of raw nanopore signal\nanalysis by introducing Rawsamble, the first mechanism for all-vs-all\noverlapping of raw signals using hash-based search.

The majority of current alignment methods rely on\nfine-tuning or prompting, which can be either costly or difficult to control.\nModel steering algorithms, which modify the model output by constructing\nspecific steering directions, are typically easy to implement and\noptimization-free. However, their capabilities are typically limited to\nsteering the model into one of the two directions (i.e., bidirectional\nsteering), and there has been no theoretical understanding to guarantee their\nperformance. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and\nquantify the model steering methods. Inspired by the framework, we propose a\nconfident direction steering method (CONFST) that steers LLMs via modifying\ntheir activations at inference time. More specifically, CONFST builds a\nconfident direction that is closely aligned with users' preferences, and this\ndirection is then added to the activations of the LLMs to effectively steer the\nmodel output. Our approach offers three key advantages over popular\nbidirectional model steering methods: 1) It is more powerful, since multiple\n(i.e. more than two) users' preferences can be aligned simultaneously; 2) It is\nsimple to implement, since there is no need to determine which layer to add the\nsteering vector to; 3) No explicit user instruction is required.

    "abstract": "Serialized TV shows are built on complex storylines that can be hard to track\nand evolve in ways that defy straightforward analysis. This paper introduces a\nmulti-agent system designed to extract and analyze these narrative arcs. Tested\non the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the system identifies three\ntypes of arcs: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and\nGenre-Specific (strictly related to the series' genre). Episodic progressions\nof these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases,\nenabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between\nautomation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical\ninterface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize\nthe data. The system performed strongly in identifying Anthology Arcs and\ncharacter entities, but its reliance on textual paratexts (such as episode\nsummaries) revealed limitations in recognizing overlapping arcs and subtler\ndynamics. This approach highlights the potential of combining computational and\nhuman expertise in narrative analysis. Beyond television, it offers promise for\nserialized written formats, where the narrative resides entirely in the text.\nFuture work will explore the integration of multimodal inputs, such as dialogue\nand visuals, and expand testing across a wider range of genres to refine the\nsystem further.",

The\ncommunity has proposed several defenses against adversarial attacks, only to be\nbroken by more advanced and adaptive attack strategies.

Unlike existing stateful defenses that detect adversarial noise\ngeneration by monitoring the input space, our approach learns adversarial\npatterns in the input update similarity space. In fact, we propose to observe a\nnew metric called Delta Similarity (DS), which we show it captures more\nefficiently the adversarial behavior.

To address these challenges, we propose\nLangevin-Assisted Active Physical Discovery (LAPD), a Bayesian framework that\nintegrates replica-exchange stochastic gradient Langevin Monte Carlo to\nsimultaneously enable efficient system identification and robust uncertainty\nquantification (UQ). By balancing gradient-driven exploration in coefficient\nspace and generating an ensemble of candidate models during exploitation, LAPD\nachieves reliable, uncertainty-aware identification with noisy data. In the\nface of data scarcity, the probabilistic foundation of LAPD further promotes\nthe integration of active learning (AL) via a hybrid uncertainty-space-filling\nacquisition function. This strategy sequentially selects informative data to\nreduce data collection costs while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate LAPD on\ndiverse nonlinear systems such as the Lotka-Volterra, Lorenz, Burgers, and\nConvection-Diffusion equations, demonstrating its robustness with noisy and\nlimited data as well as superior uncertainty calibration compared to existing\nmethods. The AL extension reduces the required measurements by around 60% for\nthe Lotka-Volterra system and by around 40% for Burgers' equation compared to\nrandom data sampling, highlighting its potential for resource-constrained\nexperiments.

We focus on\nthe relationships between iodine (I-), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4),\nand thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) through the mixer, thyroid, sensor\n(pituitary gland), and metabolism. Iodine plays a fundamental role in\nmaintaining metabolic homeostasis, as it is essential for the synthesis of T3\nand T4, which regulate weight, energy, and other physiological functions.\nIodine deficiency, which is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the\nworld, can lead to hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by fatigue, weight\ngain, and cognitive impairments [1].\n  Our model tracks the movement of iodine through dietary intake, thyroid\nabsorption, hormone synthesis, feedback regulation via TSH, and deiodization in\nmetabolism. By evaluating different forms of the accounting equation governing\nthese processes, we have concluded three key results. 1) Iodide availability\ndirectly impacts levels of T3 and T4 production, with both component flow rates\ndeclining at day 70 in a mildly diseased state, and day 60 in a severely\ndiseased state. 2) TSH is an early diagnostic indicator of thyroid issues, with\nTSH levels rising to magnitudes of 25x in just ten days, nearly six times\nquicker than other biological indicators. 3) There is a 5 day difference in\niodine storage depletion between mild and severe iodide deficiency.\nUnderstanding these results quantitatively provides insights into thyroid\ndisorders and informs strategies for managing iodine deficiency on both\nindividual and public health levels.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), initially developed for generative AI, are now\nevolving into agentic AI systems, which make decisions in complex, real-world\ncontexts. Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are\nwell-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood. This\nis particularly evident when models are handling exceptions, a critical and\nchallenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent\nincompleteness of contracts. Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that\nexcel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they\nadhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical,\nsuboptimal, or even counterproductive. We then evaluate three approaches to\ntuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting,\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. We find that while\nethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only\nslight improvements, supervised fine-tuning, specifically with human\nexplanations, yields markedly better results. Surprisingly, in our experiments,\nsupervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like\ndecision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of\nhuman-aligned decision-making across contexts. Furthermore, fine-tuning with\nexplanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that\naligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions\nare made, not just which decisions are made. These findings highlight the need\nto address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the\ndevelopment of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human\njudgment and simultaneously adapt to novel contexts.",

Adopting a terminology used by, e.g., Larsson, the sets that\nPavi\\v{c}i{\\'c} call KS sets can be called ``extended'' KS sets, since they are\nconstructed by adding observables to the ``original'' KS sets. For example,\nPavi\\v{c}i{\\'c} adds 75 observables to the original 117-observable KS set.\nBeyond terminology, there are fundamental physical reasons for focusing on the\noriginal KS sets. One reason is that, for experimentally observing quantum\nstate-independent contextuality, there is no need to measure the observables\nadded in the extended sets. Another reason is that, to produce bipartite\nperfect quantum strategies, or correlations in a face of the nonsignaling\npolytope with no local points, or correlations with nonlocal content 1, the two\nparties do not need to measure any of the observables added in the extended\nsets.

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a key machine learning technology\ndriving progress across various scientific and engineering fields, including\nwireless communication. However, its limited interpretability and\ngeneralizability remain major challenges. In supervised learning,\ngeneralizability is commonly evaluated through the generalization error using\ninformation-theoretic methods. In DRL, the training data is sequential and not\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), rendering traditional\ninformation-theoretic methods unsuitable for generalizability analysis. To\naddress this challenge, this paper proposes a novel analytical method for\nevaluating the generalizability of DRL. Specifically, we first model the\nevolution of states and actions in trained DRL algorithms as unknown discrete,\nstochastic, and nonlinear dynamical functions. Then, we employ a data-driven\nidentification method, the Koopman operator, to approximate these functions,\nand propose two interpretable representations. Based on these interpretable\nrepresentations, we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to evaluate the\ngeneralizability of DRL algorithms. This approach is formulated using the\nspectral feature analysis of the Koopman operator, leveraging the H_\\infty\nnorm. Finally, we apply this generalization analysis to compare the soft\nactor-critic method, widely recognized as a robust DRL approach, against the\nproximal policy optimization algorithm for an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted\nmmWave wireless communication scenario.",

The end-to-end inference for all nodes, is common\nfor GNN embedding models, which are widely adopted in applications like\nrecommendation and advertising. While sharing opportunities arise in GNN tasks\n(i.e., inference for a few nodes and training), the potential for sharing in\nfull graph end-to-end inference is largely underutilized because traditional\nefforts fail to fully extract sharing benefits due to overwhelming overheads or\nexcessive memory usage.\n  This paper introduces Deal, a distributed GNN inference system that is\ndedicated to end-to-end inference for all nodes for graphs with multi-billion\nedges. First, we unveil and exploit an untapped sharing opportunity during\nsampling, and maximize the benefits from sharing during subsequent GNN\ncomputation.

    "abstract": "Graph unlearning aims to remove a subset of graph entities (i.e. nodes and\nedges) from a graph neural network (GNN) trained on the graph. Unlike machine\nunlearning for models trained on Euclidean-structured data, effectively\nunlearning a model trained on non-Euclidean-structured data, such as graphs, is\nchallenging because graph entities exhibit mutual dependencies. Existing works\nutilize graph partitioning, influence function, or additional layers to achieve\ngraph unlearning. However, none of them can achieve high scalability and\neffectiveness without additional constraints. In this paper, we achieve more\neffective graph unlearning by utilizing the embedding space. The primary\ntraining objective of a GNN is to generate proper embeddings for each node that\nencapsulates both structural information and node feature representations.\nThus, directly optimizing the embedding space can effectively remove the target\nnodes' information from the model. Based on this intuition, we propose\nnode-level contrastive unlearning (Node-CUL). It removes the influence of the\ntarget nodes (unlearning nodes) by contrasting the embeddings of remaining\nnodes and neighbors of unlearning nodes. Through iterative updates, the\nembeddings of unlearning nodes gradually become similar to those of unseen\nnodes, effectively removing the learned information without directly\nincorporating unseen data. In addition, we introduce a neighborhood\nreconstruction method that optimizes the embeddings of the neighbors in order\nto remove influence of unlearning nodes to maintain the utility of the GNN\nmodel. Experiments on various graph data and models show that our Node-CUL\nachieves the best unlearn efficacy and enhanced model utility with requiring\ncomparable computing resources with existing frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent coordination is crucial for reliable multi-robot navigation in\nshared spaces such as automated warehouses. In regions of dense robot traffic,\nlocal coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these\nscenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule\nthat decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such\ncentralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem\nscale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational\nAutoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem at scale\nfaster than through centralized optimization. We formulate the coordination\nproblem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer\nLinear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes\ngood quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference\ntime, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the\nlowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. Finally, the feasible proposal\nwith the highest performance index is selected for the deployment. By\nconstruction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the\nconstraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that\nour approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions\neven for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve\nas unique probes of extragalactic matter. We report on the discovery and\nlocalization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) by the realfast\nfast transient detection system at the Very Large Array. Their unique\nsightlines allow constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We\nlocalized FRB 20230903A to its host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.09$ and FRB\n20230506C to a host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.39$. After accounting for the\ndispersion contribution from the Milky Way, the host galaxy and the\nintergalactic medium along the line of sight of the FRBs, we estimate that M31\nalone will likely contribute between 21-217 $\\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB\n20230903A and between 43-338 $\\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with a\n90% confidence. We also modeled the M31 disk's contribution to the DM to\ndetermine the halo contribution. We find that the halo of M31 will contribute\nbetween 9-145 $\\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 28-286\n$\\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with 90% confidence. The measured\nvalues of $\\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ are consistent with the predictions from the\nmodified Navarro-Frenk-White profile of M31's halo for a given impact\nparameter. The ions of the cool halo alone cannot account for the calculated\n$\\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ and therefore this measurement presents indirect evidence\nof the hot halo of M31. We also suggest a possible intersection of the line of\nsight of FRB 20230506C with a hot baryon bridge between M31 and the Milky Way",

The\nmost relevant kind of inclusion in quantum systems is that of a von Neumann\nsubalgebra, which is the focus of this work. We propose an object intrinsic to\na given algebra that indexes its potential extensions into larger algebras. We\nrefer to this object as a spatial Q-system, since it is inspired by the\nQ-system construction of Longo and others that has been used to categorify\nfinite index inclusions for properly infinite algebras. The spatial Q-system\nbroadens the usefulness of the Q-system by extending its applicability to the\ncontext of possibly infinite index inclusions admitting only operator valued\nweights rather than conditional expectations. An immediate physical motivation\nfor the spatial Q-system arises in the form of the crossed product, which is a\nmethod for extending a given algebra by the generators of a locally compact\ngroup which acts upon it. If the group in question is not finite, the inclusion\nof the original algebra into its crossed product will be of infinite index and\nadmit only an operator valued weight. Such an extension cannot be described by\na standard Q-system. The spatial Q-system covers this case and, in fact, may be\nregarded as a far reaching generalization of the crossed product in which an\nalgebra is extended by a collection of operators that possess a closed product\nstructure compatible with the original algebra, but need not generate a\nsymmetry object. We comment upon the categorical interpretation of the spatial\nQ-system, and describe how it may be interpreted as instantiating a protocol\nfor approximate, or non-isometric, quantum error correction or in terms of\nquantum reference frames. We conclude by identifying a series of physical\napplications including the study of generalized symmetries, non-perturbative\nquantum gravity, black hole evaporation and interiors, and holography.",

Moreover, since there is a\nredundancy between what constitutes \"the action\" and what constitutes \"the\nmeasure\" one can always pick a minimal form of the latter. However, the authors\nof the recent papers arXiv:2412.14108, arXiv:2412.10194 have advocated a form\nof the path integral measure for quantum gravity, proposed long ago by Fradkin\nand Vilkovisky, that is not invariant. This is easily seen since it depends\nexplicitly on the $g^{00}$ component of the inverse metric without being\ncontracted to form a scalar. An equally non-invariant measure was proposed in\narXiv:2009.00728. As noted by their proponents, when these measures are used,\ncertain divergences that typically appear are absent. However, the divergences\nthat remain with the proposed measures are, unsurprisingly, neither\ndiffeomorphism-invariant nor is the regulated effective action. We demonstrate\nthis explicitly by computing the free scalar field contribution to the\ndivergent part of the gravitational effective action using different measures\nand a proper-time cutoff. We support our findings with a thorough discussion of\nthe path integral measure. In particular, we see how the contributions from the\nmeasure, obtained in a canonical setting, could be reinterpreted in a\nrelational way compatible with diffeomorphism invariance.",

Using RAMSES, we perform a\nhydrodynamical zoom-in simulation of the central 25 cMpc/h region of a\nspherical void, identified as the lowest-density region among 1,000 random\nspheres in a parent 1 Gpc box simulation. This void has a diameter of 120\ncMpc/h and a density contrast of $\\delta \\simeq -0.8$. We find that the\nproperties of void galaxies remain stable when expanding the zoom-in region to\n50 cMpc/h, though our relatively low mass resolution impacts the results. Our\nhigher-resolution simulation aligns with the analytical HMF that accounts for\nthe void's underdensity and size. While higher resolution improves stellar mass\nestimates for low-mass halos, computational constraints necessitate a\ntheoretical framework that enables extrapolation to infinite resolution. Our\nanalytical model, calibrated to our simulations, enables extrapolation down to\nthe filtering mass of star-forming halos. To compare galaxy properties in this\nvoid with those in the field, we conduct a companion field simulation of the\nsame box size. At infinite resolution, we predict wind volume filling fractions\nof $18.6\\%$ in the field and $3.1\\%$ in our void, with values dependent on\ncosmic variance, void size, and underdensity.

Tracing the origin of GCs\nprovides invaluable insights into the formation history of the MW. However,\nreconciling diverse strands of evidence is often challenging. A notable example\nis NGC 288, where despite significant efforts in the literature, the available\nchrono-chemodynamical data have yet to provide a definitive conclusion\nregarding its origin. On the one hand, all post-Gaia dynamical studies indicate\nan accreted origin for NGC 288 from the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf\ngalaxy. On the other hand, NGC 288 has been found to be 2.5 Gyr older than\nother GSE GCs at the same metallicity, this suggesting a different (and\npossibly in situ) origin. In this work, we address the unresolved question on\nthe origin of NGC 288 by analyzing its chrono-chemical properties in an\nunprecedentedly homogeneous framework. First, we compare the location of NGC\n288 in the age-metallicity plane with that of other two in situ GCs at similar\nmetallicity, namely NGC 6218 and NGC 6362. The age estimates obtained within\nthe homogeneous framework of the CARMA collaboration show that the three\nclusters are coeval, reinforcing the contrast with the dynamical\ninterpretation. Then, we compare the abundances with a sample of in situ and\naccreted clusters at similar metallicity, finding again consistency with the\nchemistry of in situ systems. To reconcile these results with its orbital\nproperties, we propose a scenario where NGC 288 formed in the proto-disc of the\nMW, and then was dynamically heated by the interaction with the GSE merger.\nThis is a fate that resembles that of proto-disc stars undergoing the so-called\nSplash event. Therefore, NGC 288 demonstrates the importance of a homogeneous\nchrono-chemodynamical information in the interpretation of the origin of MW\nGCs.",

The results emphasize the importance\nof flavour observables as robust probes of new physics and underline the\nnecessity of global fits to avoid potential biases from limited datasets.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the interpretation of\nglobal SMEFT analyses based on high-energy collider data, comparing UV models\nthat contribute to SMEFT at tree- and loop-level.",

In this work, we search for similar moving groups\nin the velocity space of the halo, at low angular momentum. From the asymmetry\nof the radial velocity distribution $v_R$, we identify two inward-moving\nstreams with $v_R<0$ and small $|v_\\phi|$. These are projections of the\n`chevrons' previously discovered in radial phase space $(R,v_R)$. A test\nparticle simulation in a realistic Milky Way potential with a decelerating bar\nnaturally produces analogues of these features, and they are observed across a\nwide range of metallicity. They are therefore very likely to be dynamical\nstreams created by trapping in the bar's resonances. Specifically, they occupy\nregions of phase space where orbits are trapped in the corotation and outer\nLindblad resonances respectively. By tracing these streams across a range of\nradii in $(R,v_R)$ space, we fit resonant orbits to their tracks in a flexible\npotential with variable bar pattern speed. This allows us to simultaneously\nconstrain the mass profile of the Milky Way for $r\\lesssim20$ kpc and the\npattern speed $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}$. We estimate the mass enclosed within $r=20$\nkpc to be $M_{20}=(2.17\\pm0.21)\\times10^{11}M_\\odot$, and the pattern speed to\nbe $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}=31.9_{-1.9}^{+1.8}$ km/s/kpc.

We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of\nexternal UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at\nz=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the\nsame background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the\nlarge-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a\nboundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined\nwith its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and\ncapture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the\nepoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds\ngas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star\nformation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail\nto form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas\nlater accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below\n$10^{10}M_\\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z>3) exhibit lower metallicities and\naltered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding\nfrom external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative\ntransfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to\nz=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization\nhistory in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy\nformation. We conclude that at minimum, a semi-numerical model that\nincorporates spatially inhomogeneous reionization and a non-uniform metallicity\nfloor is necessary to accurately emulate metal enrichment in minihaloes.",

Depending on the gravitational couplings, the solutions may\ndescribe black holes with one or several horizons and with curvature or\nBTZ-like singularities. In other cases, the metric function behaves as\n$f(r)\\overset{(r\\rightarrow 0)}{\\sim} \\mathcal{O}(r^{2s})$ with $s\\geq 1$, and\nthe black holes are completely regular -- a feature unique to three dimensions.\nRegularity arises generically i.e., without requiring any fine-tuning of\nparameters.

We perform a thorough characterization of\nthe Penrose diagrams of the solutions, finding a rich structure which includes,\nin particular, cases which tessellate the plane and others in which the\ndiagrams cannot be drawn in a single plane. We also study the motion of probe\nparticles on the black holes, finding that observers falling to regular black\nholes reach the center after a finite proper time. Contrary to the singular\ncases, the particles are not torn apart by tidal forces, so they oscillate\nbetween antipodal points describing many-universe orbits. We argue that in\nthose cases the region $r=0$ can be interpreted as a horizon with vanishing\nsurface gravity, giving rise to generic inner-extremal regular black hole\nsolutions.

To address these challenges, we introduce TactAR, a low-cost\nteleoperation system that provides real-time tactile feedback through Augmented\nReality (AR), along with Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP), a novel slow-fast\nvisual-tactile imitation learning algorithm for learning contact-rich\nmanipulation skills. RDP employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) a slow latent\ndiffusion policy for predicting high-level action chunks in latent space at low\nfrequency, (2) a fast asymmetric tokenizer for closed-loop tactile feedback\ncontrol at high frequency. This design enables both complex trajectory modeling\nand quick reactive behavior within a unified framework. Through extensive\nevaluation across three challenging contact-rich tasks, RDP significantly\nimproves performance compared to state-of-the-art visual IL baselines.\nFurthermore, experiments show that RDP is applicable across different tactile /\nforce sensors.

Cell injury provokes\nacute emission of blue photons, and these photons sensitize muscle progenitor\ncells to the magnetic field. We show that the magnetosensitivity of muscle\nprogenitor cells is (a) activated by blue light, but not by green or red light,\nand (b) disrupted by the application of an oscillatory field at the frequency\ncorresponding to the energy of the electron-spin/magnetic field interaction.

    "abstract": "We study the conservative dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general\neffective theory of gravity which includes a metric and an arbitrary number of\nscalar fields, through $\\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$. Departures from Einstein gravity,\nwhich preserve general coordinate and local Lorentz invariance, are\ncharacterized by higher-derivative terms in a Lagrangian whose coupling\nconstants scale as powers of a ``new-physics'' length scale, $\\ell$. For a\npurely metric theory we compute the contributions from the the leading and\nsubleading higher-curvature curvature corrections. In four dimensions these are\ncubic and quartic curvature terms, i.e. orders $\\ell^4$ and $\\ell^6$. We also\nstudy a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\\ell^{4}$,\nwhich includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical\nChern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings. Specifically, we compute the radial\naction in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop\norder. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact\nobjects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital\nobservables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping\npost-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) have found ever-increasing\nuse across industry and society to accelerate clean energy transition and\nimprove energy supply reliability and resilience. However, their optimal power\nmanagement poses significant challenges: the underlying high-dimensional\nnonlinear nonconvex optimization lacks computational tractability in real-world\nimplementation, and the uncertainty of the exogenous power demand makes exact\noptimization difficult. This paper presents a new solution framework to address\nthese bottlenecks. The solution pivots on introducing power-sharing ratios to\nspecify each cell's power quota from the output power demand. To find the\noptimal power-sharing ratios, we formulate a nonlinear model predictive control\n(NMPC) problem to achieve power-loss-minimizing BESS operation while complying\nwith safety, cell balancing, and power supply-demand constraints. We then\npropose a parameterized control policy for the power-sharing ratios, which\nutilizes only three parameters, to reduce the computational demand in solving\nthe NMPC problem. This policy parameterization allows us to translate the NMPC\nproblem into a Bayesian inference problem for the sake of 1) computational\ntractability, and 2) overcoming the nonconvexity of the optimization problem.\nWe leverage the ensemble Kalman inversion technique to solve the parameter\nestimation problem. Concurrently, a low-level control loop is developed to\nseamlessly integrate our proposed approach with the BESS to ensure practical\nimplementation. This low-level controller receives the optimal power-sharing\nratios, generates output power references for the cells, and maintains a\nbalance between power supply and demand despite uncertainty in output power. We\nconduct extensive simulations and experiments on a 20-cell prototype to\nvalidate the proposed approach.",

Model deduplication is a technique widely used by many\nmodel serving and database systems to support high-performance and low-cost\ninference queries and model diagnosis queries.

The second\nuses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the\nspace of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two\nmechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to\nsteer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that\nencourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer\nLMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and\ninterpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms\ncan be predicted and controlled.",

Propensity score matching is a popular method to adjust for\nsuch confounding. It compares weighted averages of patient responses. The\nweights are calculated from logistic regression models with the intention to\nreduce differences between the confounders in the treatment groups. However,\nthe groups are only \"roughly matched\" with no generally accepted principle to\ndetermine when a match is \"good enough\".\n  In this manuscript, we propose an alternative approach to the matching\nproblem by considering it as a constrained optimization problem. We investigate\nthe conditions for exact matching in the sense that the average values of\nconfounders are identical in the treatment groups after matching. Our approach\nis similar to the matching-adjusted indirect comparison approach by\nSignorovitch et al.

The accuracy of one-dimensional pressure drops derived from 4D-flow has\nbeen explored previously, but additional work is needed to evaluate the\naccuracy of 3D relative pressure field estimates. This work presents an\nanalysis of three state-of-the-art relative pressure estimators: virtual\nWork-Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP), the Pressure Poisson Estimator (PPE),\nand the Stokes Estimator (STE). The spatiotemporal characteristics and\nsensitivity to noise were determined in silico. Estimators were then validated\nusing a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) flow phantom with varying tear geometry\nand twelve catheter pressure measurements. Finally, the performance of each\nestimator was evaluated across eight patient cases. In silico pressure field\nerrors were lower in STE compared to PPE, although PPE pressures were less\nnoise sensitive. High velocity gradients and low spatial resolution contributed\nmost significantly to local variations in 3D pressure field errors. Low\ntemporal resolution lead to systematic underestimation of highly transient peak\npressure events. In the flow phantom analysis, vWERP was the most accurate\nmethod, followed by STE and PPE. Each pressure estimator was strongly\ncorrelated with ground truth pressure values, despite the tendency to\nunderestimate peak pressures.

Therefore, this paper\nproposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. Incorporating sentence-level factuality as\nmask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the\npreferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not\npreferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly\nimprove the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and\nout-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics\nare unseen during training. Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of\nLlama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%,\neven surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its\nFactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29%\nto 39.39%. We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using\ndifferent training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number\nof topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions. We\nprovide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the\nimplication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to\nverify it. We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research\non scaling factuality alignment.",

Our extensive empirical evaluation across diverse image and\nlanguage datasets demonstrates that the infinite learning rate schedule\nconsistently enhances continual pre-training performance compared to a repeated\ncosine decay without being restricted to a fixed iteration budget. For\ninstance, in a small-scale MAE pre-training setup, it outperforms several\nstrong baselines from the literature.

Current\nzero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with\ntheir performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the\npre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting\ndiverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel\nframework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs)\nsequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal\ncharacteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable\nPTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and\nfuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of\nthese PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks,\nallowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation\nspace of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that\nSeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The rise of AI-driven coding assistants signals a fundamental shift in how\nsoftware is built. While AI coding assistants have been integrated into\nexisting Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential\nremains largely untapped. A key challenge is that these AI assistants can\nsuffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI\nshould not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent.\nMoreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical\nissues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating\nversion control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted\ndevelopment. As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to\nmanage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it\ndifficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development\nprocess. Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited\nsupport for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths.\n  Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused\non balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to\nIDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free\nfrom traditional file structures. This approach fosters a more fluid and\ninteractive method for code evolution. We introduce the concept of a\nBonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and\nmultiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit\ntheir needs. Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model\ntoward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of\ngenerated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather\nthan merely serving as a place to write and edit code.",

To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an\nRLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization.\nSpecifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective\nand theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a\ntoken-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly\ncombines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we\nfurther bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the\npure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a\nreverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different\ntokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct\nan appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and\nshowcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward\noptimization.",

Specifically, let $R$ be a Noetherian ring, let $P$ be a prime ideal\nof $R$ of height $h$, let $A:=R/P$, and $W$ be a subset of $R$ that maps onto\n$A\\setminus \\{0\\}$. Suppose that $R_P$ is Cohen-Macaulay, and that $\\omega$ is\na finitely generated $R$-module such that $\\omega_P$ is a canonical module for\n$R_P$. Let $E:=H^h_P(\\omega)$. We show that for every finitely generated\n$R$-module $M$ there exists $g \\in W$ such that for all $j\\geq 0$, $H_P^j(M)_g\n\\cong \\mathrm{Hom}_R(\\mathrm{Ext}_R^{h-j}(M,\\, \\omega),\\, E)_g$, and that,\nmoreover, every $H_P^j(M)_g$ has an ascending filtration by a countable\nsequence of finitely generated submodules such that the factors are finitely\ngenerated free $A_g$-modules. In fact, this sequence may be taken to be\n$\\{\\mathrm{Ann}_{H_P^j(M)_g}P^n\\}_n$.

This result enables us to\nprove that excellent strongly F-regular rings are very strongly F-regular (also\ncalled F-pure regular). Another consequence is that the F-pure locus is open in\nan S$_2$ ring that is a homomorphic image of an excellent Cohen-Macxaulay ring.",

The SM\nprovides a very good description of visible matter, with the proton being a\ncentral part of this understanding. The structure of the proton can be\nparametrised in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), essential inputs\nfor theoretical predictions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which cannot be\ncomputed from first principles and must be obtained from fits to experimental\ndata.\n  Despite the remarkable success of the SM, many fundamental questions remain\nunanswered, motivating the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).\nThese searches often rely on precise comparisons between theoretical\npredictions and experimental measurements. However, a significant challenge\narises because PDFs are typically determined under SM assumptions. This\napproach can introduce potential biases and inconsistencies in BSM searches.\nAdditionally, signals of BSM physics may be absorbed by the PDFs during the\nfitting procedure, further complicating the interpretation of the results.\n  This PhD thesis explores the interplay between PDFs and BSM physics. We\nintroduce the open-source release of SIMUnet, a deep learning framework\ndesigned to perform simultaneous fits of PDFs and BSM parameters, as well as to\nassess the potential absorption of BSM signals by the PDFs. We study the\nPDF-BSM interplay in the top sector and in a global dataset, and assess the\nabsorption of BSM physics in widely used models.

We show\nthat for $2\\times 2$ matrix games, OMWU achieves an $O(T^{-1/6})$ best-iterate\nconvergence rate, in stark contrast to its slow last-iterate convergence in the\nsame class of games. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound showing that OMWU\ndoes not achieve any polynomial random-iterate convergence rate, measured by\nthe expected duality gaps across all iterates. This result challenges the\nconventional wisdom that random-iterate convergence is essentially equivalent\nto best-iterate convergence, with the former often used as a proxy for\nestablishing the latter. Our analysis uncovers a new connection to dynamic\nregret and presents a novel two-phase approach to best-iterate convergence,\nwhich could be of independent interest.",

We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a\ngenerative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed\ntaste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising:\naccording the participants' ($n=111$) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces\nmusic that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to\nthe non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards\nunderstanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and\ntaste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI.

Specifically, we\nare referring to the classical entropies: the Boltzmann-Gibbs, von Neumann,\nShannon, Kolmogorov-Sinai and topological entropies. In addition to their\ncommon name, which is historically justified (as we briefly describe in this\nreview), other commonality of the classical entropies is the important role\nthat they have played and are still playing in the theory and applications of\ntheir respective fields and beyond. Therefore, it is not surprising that, in\nthe course of time, many other instances of the overarching concept of entropy\nhave been proposed, most of them tailored to specific purposes. Following the\ncurrent usage, we will refer to all of them, whether classical or new, simply\nas entropies. Precisely, the subject of this review is their applications in\ndata analysis and machine learning. The reason for these particular\napplications is that entropies are very well suited to characterize probability\nmass distributions, typically generated by finite-state processes or symbolized\nsignals. Therefore, we will focus on entropies defined as positive functionals\non probability mass distributions and provide an axiomatic characterization\nthat goes back to Shannon and Khinchin. Given the plethora of entropies in the\nliterature, we have selected a representative group, including the classical\nones.

    "abstract": "Physical manipulation of garments is often crucial when performing\nfabric-related tasks, such as hanging garments. However, due to the deformable\nnature of fabrics, these operations remain a significant challenge for robots\nin household, healthcare, and industrial environments. In this paper, we\npropose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on\nrobot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate\ngarment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to\nrepresent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment.\nGraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that\ncan predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in\nsimulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual\nmodel that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving\nreal-world performance. The garment dynamics model is then applied to a\nmodel-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the\ngarment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We\nconducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach\nin both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments,\nGraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a\nprediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline. Our approach also\ndemonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment\nwith enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world\nrobot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error\nincrease of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.

This paper advances\nthe minimalist approach by introducing a two-layer network with a\ntwo-dimensional input, where one dimension is relevant to the response and the\nother is irrelevant. Through this model, we rigorously prove the existence of\nprogressive sharpening and self-stabilization under large learning rates, and\nestablish non-asymptotic analysis of the training dynamics and sharpness along\nthe entire GD trajectory. Besides, we connect our minimalist example to\nexisting works by reconciling the existence of a well-behaved ``stable set\"\nbetween minimalist and generalist analyses, and extending the analysis of\nGradient Flow Solution sharpness to our two-dimensional input scenario. These\nfindings provide new insights into the EoS phenomenon from both parameter and\ninput data distribution perspectives, potentially informing more effective\noptimization strategies in deep learning practice.",

Such heavy reliance on third-party\npackages has eventually brought forward resilience and maintenance concerns,\nsuch as security attacks and outdated dependencies. In this vision paper, we\ninvestigate packages that challenge the typical concepts of reuse--that is,\npackages with no dependencies themselves that bear the responsibility of being\nat the end of the dependency supply chain. We find that these end-of-chain\npackages vary in characteristics and not just packages that can be easily\nreplaced: an active, well-maintained package at the end of the chain; a\n\"classical\" package that has remained unchanged for 11 years; a trivial package\nnested deep in the dependency chain; a package that may appear trivial; and a\npackage that bundled up and absorbed its dependencies.

Its inverse map, fermionization, shows how spin structures\nand $Z_2^f$ fermion parity emerge from a bosonic theory equipped with a dual\n$Z_2^{(1)}$ generalized symmetry. The second method,flux attachment, gives spin\nand statistics to charged particles by coupling them to a Chern-Simons theory,\nand provides the basis for the Abelian dualities. We illustrate the two\nbosonizations with explicit results in a solvable semiclassical conformal\ntheory, and show their differences and interplays with particle-vortex\ndualities. We employ the so-called loop model, which can describe general\ninfrared critical points in 2+1 dimensions in the semiclassical limit.

First, we strengthen the topology in the known\nchordal LDPs into the topology of full parameterized curves including all curve\nendpoints. We also obtain LDPs in the space of unparameterized curves. Second,\nwe address the radial case, which requires in part different methods from the\nchordal case, due to the different topological setup. We establish our main\nresults via proving an exponential tightness property and combining it with\ndetailed curve return probability estimates, in the spirit of exponentially\ngood approximations in LDP theory. In the radial case, additional work is\nrequired to refine the estimates appearing in the literature. Notably, since we\nmanage to prove a finite-time LDP in a better topology than in earlier\nliterature, return energy estimates follow as a consequence of the return\nprobability estimates.",

    "abstract": "Social foraging is a widespread form of animal foraging in which groups of\nindividuals coordinate their decisions to exploit resources in the environment.\nAnimals show a variety of social structures from egalitarian to hierarchical.\nIn this study, we examine how different forms of social hierarchy shape\nforaging decisions. We developed a mechanistic analytically tractable model to\nstudy the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic\nindividual to the macroscopic group levels. Based on a stochastic evidence\naccumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a\nlarge hierarchical group with leading and following individuals. Across a\nvariety of information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically\nquantify emergent collective dynamics. We found that follower-leader dynamics\nthrough observations of leader movements or through counting the number of\nindividuals in a patch confers, for most conditions, a benefit for the\nfollowing individuals by increasing their accuracy in inferring patch richness.\nOn the other hand, misinformation, through the communication of false beliefs\nabout food rewards or patch quality, shows to be detrimental to following\nindividuals, but paradoxically may lead to increased group cohesion. In an era\nwhere there is a huge amount of animal foraging data collected, our model\nprovides a systematic way to conceptualize and understand those data by\nuncovering hidden mechanisms underlying social foraging decisions.",

    "abstract": "The chain rule lies at the heart of the powerful Gamma calculus for Markov\ndiffusions on manifolds, providing remarkable connections between several\nfundamental notions such as Bakry-\\'Emery curvature, entropy decay, and\nhypercontractivity. For Markov chains on finite state spaces, approximate\nversions of this chain rule have recently been put forward, with an extra cost\nthat depends on the log-Lipschitz regularity of the considered observable.\nMotivated by those findings, we here investigate the regularity of extremizers\nin the discrete log-Sobolev inequality. Specifically, we show that their\nlog-Lipschitz constant is bounded by a universal multiple of $\\log d$, where\n$d$ denotes the inverse of the smallest non-zero transition probability. As a\nconsequence, we deduce that the log-Sobolev constant of any reversible Markov\nchain on a finite state space is at least a universal multiple of $\\kappa/\\log\nd$, where $\\kappa$ is the Bakry-\\'Emery curvature. This is a sharp discrete\nanalogue of what is perhaps the most emblematic application of the\nBakry-\\'Emery theory for diffusions. We also obtain a very simple proof of the\nmain result in \\cite{MR4620718}, which asserts that the log-Sobolev constant\nand its modified version agree up to a $\\log d$ factor. Our work consolidates\nthe role of the sparsity parameter $\\log d$ as a universal cost for\ntransferring results from Markov diffusions to discrete chains.",

There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy\ncollision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on\ncurrent quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined\nmesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a\nparticle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple,\nexperimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of\ncolliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement\nstrength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We\nfind that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition\nof differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size\noscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are\ncontrolled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant\nconfinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial\nexcitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective\nmass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of\nthe central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with\ntime due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence\nof linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement\nlimit.

    "abstract": "Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven\nby the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually\ncontrolled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an\nopen-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up\nprecomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the\nother hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set\npoints online, which makes them more flexible and resilient.\n  This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller\nusing the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated\nby a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter\nto continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel\noptimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to\nmaximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table\nindustry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without\nusing a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying\nconditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4\n% with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased\nmeasurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy\ncontrol baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table\ncontrollers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to\ndisturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free\nconditions.",

Accounting for\nmissing data by imputing or weighting conditional on covariates relies on the\nvariable with missingness being observed at least some of the time for all\nunique covariate values. This requirement is referred to as positivity, and\nviolations can result in bias. Here, we review a novel approach to addressing\npositivity violations in the context of systolic blood pressure. Methods: To\nillustrate the proposed approach, we estimate the mean systolic blood pressure\namong children and adolescents aged 2-17 years old in the United States using\ndata from 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nAs blood pressure was never measured for those aged 2-7, there exists a\npositivity violation by design. Using a recently proposed synthesis of\nstatistical and mathematical models, we integrate external information with\nNHANES to address our motivating question. Results: With the synthesis model,\nthe estimated mean systolic blood pressure was 100.5 (95% confidence interval:\n99.9, 101.0), which is notably lower than either a complete-case analysis or\nextrapolation from a statistical model. The synthesis results were supported by\na diagnostic comparing the performance of the mathematical model in the\npositive region. Conclusion: Positivity violations pose a threat to\nquantitative medical research, and standard approaches to addressing\nnonpositivity rely on restrictive untestable assumptions. Using a synthesis\nmodel, like the one detailed here, offers a viable alternative through\nintegration of external information.",

We address the problem by developing two new finite blocklength\nachievability bounds, which we use to benchmark the performance of two coding\nschemes based on polar codes with outer cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes --\nalso referred to as CRC-aided (CA) polar codes. The first bound is obtained by\nconsidering an outer detection code, whereas the second bound relies on a\nthreshold test applied to the generalized information density. Similarly, in\nthe first CA polar code scheme, we reserve a fraction of the outer CRC parity\nbits for error detection, whereas in the second scheme, we apply a threshold\ntest (specifically, Forney's optimal rule) to the output of the successive\ncancellation list decoder. Numerical simulations performed on the binary-input\nAWGN channel reveal that, in the short-blocklength regime, the threshold-based\napproach is superior to the CRC-based approach, both in terms of bounds and\nperformance of CA polar code schemes.

Current models rely on\nstructural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity\ndrug combinations.

Here, we\nintroduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway,\ncell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects\nacross 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of\napproved drugs and novel compounds in development.

It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in\npredicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of\nanticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II\ndiabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It\nidentifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts\nresmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with\nthe most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by\nintegrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid\nleukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy\nof personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language\nmodel allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving\nsafety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity\nrisks.

By means of broadband time-resolved\noptical spectroscopy, we show that this selective electron-phonon coupling\ndictates the nonequilibrium optical response of MgB$_2$ at early times (<100\nfs) after photoexcitation.

The unconscious and automatic nature of implicit bias makes it\nparticularly challenging to study. This paper provides a comprehensive review\nof the existing literature on implicit bias in LLMs. We begin by introducing\nkey concepts, theories and methods related to implicit bias in psychology,\nextending them from humans to LLMs. Drawing on the Implicit Association Test\n(IAT) and other psychological frameworks, we categorize detection methods into\nthree primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation and\ndecision-making. We divide our taxonomy of evaluation metrics for implicit bias\ninto two categories: single-value-based metrics and comparison-value-based\nmetrics. We classify datasets into two types: sentences with masked tokens and\ncomplete sentences, incorporating datasets from various domains to reflect the\nbroad application of LLMs. Although research on mitigating implicit bias in\nLLMs is still limited, we summarize existing efforts and offer insights on\nfuture challenges.

Recently, we\nsuggested an analytical approach based on a combination of the modal expansion\nmethod (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). Here, we extend the\nMEM+DEM approach for particles of various shapes and orientations. To\nillustrate the possibilities of our method, we calculate extinction and\nscattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms,\nbicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 100 nm.\nFor the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our\nanalytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL, except for\nsome disagreement between MEM and COMSOL solutions for bicones with small\nrounding radii. To illustrate the application of our method, we prepared 12\nAuNR samples using a chemical etching with fine tuning of the LPR over the\n1020-580 nm range. By including the CTAB shell in the simulation model, we\nachieved excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dependence of\nthe LPR peak position on the AuNR aspect ratio. In summary, our method uses the\nMEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional\nnumerical calculations to build analytical models for bilayered or multilayered\nconjugates.

    "abstract": "Most super-resolution (SR) models struggle with real-world low-resolution\n(LR) images. This issue arises because the degradation characteristics in the\nsynthetic datasets differ from those in real-world LR images. Since SR models\nare trained on pairs of high-resolution (HR) and LR images generated by\ndownsampling, they are optimized for simple degradation. However, real-world LR\nimages contain complex degradation caused by factors such as the imaging\nprocess and JPEG compression. Due to these differences in degradation\ncharacteristics, most SR models perform poorly on real-world LR images. This\nstudy proposes a dataset generation method using undertrained image\nreconstruction models. These models have the property of reconstructing\nlow-quality images with diverse degradation from input images. By leveraging\nthis property, this study generates LR images with diverse degradation from HR\nimages to construct the datasets. Fine-tuning pre-trained SR models on our\ngenerated datasets improves noise removal and blur reduction, enhancing\nperformance on real-world LR images. Furthermore, an analysis of the datasets\nreveals that degradation diversity contributes to performance improvements,\nwhereas color differences between HR and LR images may degrade performance. 11\npages, (11 figures and 2 tables)",

Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical\nenvironments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density,\nmomentum flux, and the total pressure. Modelling the dynamic interaction\nbetween radiation and magnetized plasmas in such environments is an intricate\nand computationally costly task. Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate\nthe capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational\nframework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics\n(RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated\nmagnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and\nflux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are\ncombined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on\nblock-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results.\nWe introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative\nMHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann\nproblems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall\nthe basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion\nrelation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation\nfields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8\nlinear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three\nwave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion\nmode. Conclusions. The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform\nmultidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited\nfor larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation\ninteractions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.",

Building\non the works of Karmel and MacLachlan (1988) and Blackburn et al.

A key\nadvantage of our proposed measure lies in its ease of implementation and\ninterpretation, even when working with datasets encompassing a large number of\ncountries or time periods. Moreover, our measure can be consistently applied in\nthe case of lumpy sectors or occupations that account for a large fraction of\nthe workforce. We illustrate the new measure in an analysis of the\ncross-country relationship between economic development (as measured by GDP per\ncapita) and occupational and sectoral gender segregation. Comparing the crude\nID with the standardized ID, we show that the crude ID overestimates the\npositive correlation between income and segregation, especially between low-\nand middle-income countries. This suggests that analyses relying on the crude\nID risk overestimating the importance of income differentials in explaining\ncross-country variation in gender segregation.",

The abundance ratios of COMs derived for these eruptive YSOs, as\nwell as for other protostars in the literature, span several orders of\nmagnitude without any clear differentiation between the eruptive and quiescent\nYSOs.

However, effort regarding breakdown phenomenon\nin photocathode relevant semiconductors have been more limited. In this work,\nwe explore field-emission-assisted heating via Nottingham and Joule processes,\nas a possible candidate for breakdown initiation. For this, field emission from\nintrinsic Cs2Te ultra-thin film coated on a copper substrate was modeled within\nthe Stratton/Baskin/Lvov/Fursey (SBLF) formalism, describing the processes and\neffects in the bulk and on the surface of a photocathode exposed to high\nradio-frequency electromagnetic fields. It is shown that field emission\ncharacteristic deviates significantly from the classical Fowler-Nordheim (FN)\ntheory, whereby predicting that dark current is orders of magnitude lower than\none expected by FN law. Conventional pulsed heating was also found to impose\nnegligible heating to the photo-cathode.

    "abstract": "We study the spectral properties and local topology of the Kane-Mele-Rashba\nmodel on a Sierpinski Carpet (SC) fractal, constructed from a rectangular flake\nwith an underlying honeycomb arrangement and open boundary conditions. When the\nsystem parameters correspond to a topologically trivial phase, the energy\nspectrum is characterized solely by bulk states that are not significantly\nmodified by the system's fractality. For parameters corresponding to the\nquantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, in addition to bulk states, the\nenergy spectrum exhibits in-gap topological states that are strongly influenced\nby the fractal geometry. As the fractal generation increases, the in-gap\ntopological states acquire a staircase profile, which translates into sharp\npeaks in the density of states. We also show that both the QSHI and the trivial\nphase exhibit a large gap in the valence-projected spin spectrum, allowing the\nuse of the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) to index the local topology of the\nsystem. Fractality does not affect this gap, allowing the application of LSCM\nto higher fractal generations. Our results explore the LSCM versatility,\nshowing its potential to access local topology in complex geometries such as\nfractal systems.",

    "abstract": "SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical\ninflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here we\nreport on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54\nin June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux\nincrease by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented\ncontinuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the\nflux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours.\nFurthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period\n$P_{\\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by\naccretion rate ($\\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star\nmass loss rate. We estimate $\\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an\nincrease in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same\nfactor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary\nsystem during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the\ndonor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a\nmean density $\\left < \\rho \\right > \\sim 18 \\text{ kg} \\text{ m}^{-3}$ for the\ndonor star, compared to $\\left < \\rho_{\\mathrm{RL}} \\right > = 0.7-1 \\text{ kg}\n\\text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star.

This paper addresses this gap by systematically analysing the maximal\nbranches of the moduli space of $\\mathcal{N}=3$ and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ CSM\nrealised via Type IIB brane constructions.

Secondly, for $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theories\nwith CS-levels greater $1$, where $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ dualisation does\nnot yield CS-free Lagrangians, a new prescription is introduced to derive two\nmagnetic quivers, $\\mathsf{MQ}_A $ and $\\mathsf{MQ}_B$, whose Coulomb branches\ncapture the maximal A and B branches of the original $\\mathcal{N}=4$ CSM\ntheory. Applying the decay and fission algorithm to $ \\mathsf{MQ}_{A/B}$ then\nenables the systematic analysis of A/B branch RG flows and their geometric\nstructures.

This paper introduces Seeded Poisson\nFactorization (SPF), a novel approach that extends the Poisson Factorization\nframework by incorporating domain knowledge through seed words. SPF enables a\nmore interpretable and structured topic discovery by modifying the prior\ndistribution of topic-specific term intensities, assigning higher initial rates\nto predefined seed words. The model is estimated using variational inference\nwith stochastic gradient optimization, ensuring scalability to large datasets.\n  We apply SPF to an Amazon customer feedback dataset, leveraging predefined\nproduct categories as guiding structures. Our evaluation demonstrates that SPF\nachieves superior classification performance compared to alternative guided\ntopic models, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and predictive\nperformance. Furthermore, robustness checks highlight SPF's ability to\nadaptively balance domain knowledge and data-driven topic discovery, even in\ncases of imperfect seed word selection.

However, the\nhard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to\nregular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the\npolicy to be tailored for each object.

Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite\nphoton density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions\nlead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry\nand have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the\nunit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic\nunit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the\nnon-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds\nfor phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum\nfluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole\nquantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a\ncooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features\narising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct\nmagnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered\nsuperradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions.\nExamples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the\nsquare lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit\ncell on the triangular lattice.

    "abstract": "In order to reduce light pollution we have to reduce the overall amount of\nartificial light emissions. This is a consequence of the basic rules governing\nthe propagation of light in the terrestrial environment. In this work I revisit\nthe physical laws causing that (i) \"all\" artificial light emitted outdoors is\nlost or pollutant, (ii) the negative effects of light pollution depend\nmonotonically on the local concentration of photons of anthropogenic origin,\nand (iii) this concentration depends linearly on the total artificial light\nemissions, weighted by the light pollution propagation functions. Setting total\nemission limits becomes necessary in order to ensure that the negative effects\nof light pollution do not surpass red-lines of unacceptable degradation of the\nnatural night. Once these red-lines are socially agreed, monitoring compliance\nbecomes a relevant task. Several complementary methods for assessing total\nlight emissions are being used nowadays, including public inventories of\ninstalled lights, direct radiance measurements from ground or low Earth orbit\nsatellites, and scattered radiance measurements using ground based detectors\n(night sky brightness monitoring). While updated administrative inventories\ncould in principle be trusted, independent verification is a must. The required\nmeasurements pose in turn significant challenges: we discuss here how the\nvariability of the terrestrial atmosphere sets a lower limit on the minimum\nemission changes that can be reliably detected by measurements, and propose\nsome ways to improve this performance.",

This paper experimentally compares different knowledge\ngeneration and self-refinement strategies for LLM-based column type annotation.\nThe strategies include using LLMs to generate term definitions, error-based\nrefinement of term definitions, self-correction, and fine-tuning using examples\nand term definitions. We evaluate these strategies along two dimensions:\neffectiveness measured as F1 performance and efficiency measured in terms of\ntoken usage and cost.

    "abstract": "When receiving radar pulses it is common for a recorded pulse train to\ncontain pulses from many different emitters. The radar pulse deinterleaving\nproblem is the task of separating out these pulses by the emitter from which\nthey originated. Notably, the number of emitters in any particular recorded\npulse train is considered unknown. In this paper, we define the problem and\npresent metrics that can be used to measure model performance. We propose a\nmetric learning approach to this problem using a transformer trained with the\ntriplet loss on synthetic data. This model achieves strong results in\ncomparison with other deep learning models with an adjusted mutual information\nscore of 0.882.",

As the critical plasma-facing\nmaterial in fusion reactors, radiation damage in tungsten has been studied\nextensively in experiments and simulations. Irradiation experiments routinely\nproduce recoils in the MeV range while full atomistic modelling has been\nlimited to a few hundred keV. Here we bridge these scales with extremely\nlarge-scale and accurate machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations\nwith recoil energies up to 2 MeV in systems up to one billion atoms. We reveal\nfour regimes of primary damage as a function of damage energy, with a\ntransition to a high-energy regime that deviates from all previous models.\nCuriously, the start of the high-energy regime coincides with the highest\npossible recoil energy to tungsten atoms from fusion-emitted neutrons (300\nkeV).",

    "abstract": "String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework\nfor quantum gravity and force unification with promising prospects to resolve\nissues like dark matter and dark energy which cannot be satisfactorily\nincorporated within the framework of general relativity (GR). The goal of the\npresent work is to investigate the role of the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion\n(EMDA) gravity arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic\nstring theory in explaining astrophysical observations, in particular, the\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the power\nspectrum of black holes. EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications\nand hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in\navailable astrophysical observations. This requires one to study the\nstationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity, which\ncorresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime. Such black holes are endowed with a\ndilatonic charge while the rotation is sourced from the axionic field. We\ninvestigate the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of matter rotating in the\nKerr-Sen spacetime and consider eleven well-studied QPO models in this work. We\ncompare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of\nfive BH sources, namely, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105, H 143+322, GRO J1655-40\nand Sgr A*. Our analysis provides constrains on the spins of the aforesaid\nblack holes which when compared with previous estimates enables us to\nunderstand the observationally favored QPO models for each of these sources.\nFurther, from the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor\nof general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our\nfinding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.",

In addition, there have been no long-term\nstudies of SAH so the extent to which it has been successfully sustained over\ntime is not well understood. We present an analysis of 6.5 million\n\"#StopAsianHate\" tweets from 2.2 million users all over the globe and spanning\n60 different languages, constituting the first study of the non-English and\ntransnational component of the online SAH movement. Using a combination of\ntopic modeling, user modeling, and hand annotation, we identify and\ncharacterize the dominant discussions and users participating in the movement\nand draw comparisons of English versus non-English topics and users. We\ndiscover clear differences in events driving topics, where spikes in English\ntweets are driven by violent crimes in the US but spikes in non-English tweets\nare driven by transnational incidents of anti-Asian sentiment towards symbolic\nrepresentatives of Asian nations. We also find that global K-pop fans were\nquick to adopt the SAH movement and, in fact, sustained it for longer than any\nother user group.

    "abstract": "The di-top final state is an important search channel for additional Higgs\nbosons at the LHC. In this channel, large signal--background interference\ncontributions can strongly distort a resonance peak as it would be expected\nfrom a pure signal contribution. Moreover, signal--signal interference effects\ncan have a significant impact if more than one additional scalar particle is\npresent. In this work, we perform a comprehensive model-independent analysis of\nthe various interference contributions considering two additional heavy scalars\nthat can mix with each other. We point out the importance of taking into\naccount loop-level mixing between the scalars. A proper treatment of these\nmixing effects, which has not been previously carried out for the di-top final\nstate, introduces additional relative phases between different parts of the\namplitudes entering the interference contributions which we find to have a\nstrong impact on the di-top invariant mass distribution. We study the\ninterference effects both in an idealistic setting as well as taking into\naccount experimental limitations using Monte-Carlo simulations. We demonstrate\nthat the emerging experimental signatures can be unexpected and difficult to\ninterpret. In particular, we point out that an experimental signature\nmanifesting itself as an excess near the $t \\bar t$ threshold may actually be\ncaused by new scalar particles with much higher masses. We comment in this\ncontext on the recent excess that has been observed by the CMS collaboration\nnear the $t \\bar t$ threshold in their searches in the di-top final state.",

To address this gap we conducted a user study with 16\ngame designers and developers to examine their behaviour and interaction with\ngenerative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design\nstage is preferred by all participants. Designers and developers are inclined\nto use such tools for creating large amounts of variations at the cost of\nquality as they can improve the quality of the artefacts once they generate a\nsuitable asset. The results also strongly raised the need for better\nintegration of such tools in existing design and development environments and\nthe need for the outputs to be in common data formats, to be manipulatable and\nsmoothly integrate into existing environments. The study also highlights the\nrequirement for further emphasis on the needs of the users to incorporate these\ntools effectively in existing pipelines.

The law has been essential to the internet's\ndevelopment over the last twenty years, but it has not kept pace with the times\nand is now a source of deep consternation to courts and legislatures.

Microweather, or the weather\nconditions in highly localized areas, is particularly complex in urban\nenvironments owing to the chaotic and turbulent nature of wind flows.\nFurthermore, traditional means of assessing local wind fields are not generally\nviable solutions for UAM applications: 1) field measurements that would rely on\npermanent wind profiling systems in operational air space are not practical, 2)\nphysics-based models that simulate fluid dynamics at a sufficiently high\nresolution are not computationally tractable, and 3) data-driven modeling\napproaches that are largely deterministic ignore the inherent variability in\nturbulent flows that dictates UAM reliability. Thus, advancements in predictive\ncapabilities are needed to help mitigate the unique operational safety risks\nthat microweather winds pose for smaller, lighter weight UAM aircraft.\n  This work aims to model microweather wind velocities in a manner that is\ncomputationally-efficient, captures random variability, and would only require\na temporary, rather than permanent, field measurement campaign. Inspired by\nrecent breakthroughs in conditional generative AI such as text-to-image\ngeneration, the proposed approach learns a probabilistic macro-to-microweather\nmapping between regional weather forecasts and measured local wind velocities\nusing generative modeling (denoising diffusion probabilistic models, flow\nmatching, and Gaussian mixture models). A simple proof of concept was\nimplemented using a dataset comprised of local (micro) measurements from a\nSonic Detection and Ranging (SoDAR) wind profiler along with (macro) forecast\ndata from a nearby weather station over the same time period.",

However, the performance gap\nbetween SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread\nadoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention\nAggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures\nboth spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven\nself-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we\npioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal\nrelationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information\naggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features\nat different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy\nto avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial\nand temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and\nmake accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance\nacross diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.\nNotably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets\nCIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the\nstatic datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively.

Recently,\nmany MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly\ntarget LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA\nmethods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these\ntechniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular\ndistribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar\nsetups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware\nPillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar\nlevel in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a\nsingle mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to\neach pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different\nclasses, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large\nvehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse\nobjects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This\nclass-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new\ninformation, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance\nbut also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street\nand K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will\nspark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based\nagents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite\ntheir successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations\nand require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent\nplanning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike\nprevious methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require\nsignificant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level\ngeneral guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables\ncontinuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's\ntask execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks\ndemonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover,\nour analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances\nboth task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous\nunseen scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic downscaling typically involves using numerical weather prediction\n(NWP) solvers to refine coarse data to higher spatial resolutions. Data-driven\nmodels such as FourCastNet have emerged as a promising alternative to the\ntraditional NWP models for forecasting. Once these models are trained, they are\ncapable of delivering forecasts in a few seconds, thousands of times faster\ncompared to classical NWP models. However, as the lead times, and, therefore,\ntheir forecast window, increase, these models show instability in that they\ntend to diverge from reality. In this paper, we propose to use data\nassimilation approaches to stabilize them when used for downscaling tasks. Data\nassimilation uses information from three different sources, namely an imperfect\ncomputational model based on partial differential equations (PDE), from noisy\nobservations, and from an uncertainty-reflecting prior. In this work, when\ncarrying out dynamic downscaling, we replace the computationally expensive\nPDE-based NWP models with FourCastNet in a ``weak-constrained 4DVar framework\"\nthat accounts for the implied model errors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this\napproach for a hurricane-tracking problem; moreover, the 4DVar framework\nnaturally allows the expression and quantification of uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate, using ERA5 data, that our approach performs better than the\nensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the unstabilized FourCastNet model, both in\nterms of forecast accuracy and forecast uncertainty.",

Moreover, the presence of state-dependent correlated\nnoise adds further complexity to the analysis, making the proof of the\ncomparison theorem more challenging.

These aspects of autonomy can be taken into account when analyzing\nor defining the limits of autonomy in large-scale agile software development.\nThe use of the framework is illustrated with an example.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental\nchallenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language\nprocessing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized,\nstructured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could\nrevolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks\nnew ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured\nrecipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing\nof four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an\ninnovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics\n(WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element\nidentification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting\nachieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating\nfor the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific\nunstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although\nmodel performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential\nin smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted\nfine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured\ndata generation across various domains, from medical records to technical\ndocumentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and\nutilize unstructured information.",

This architecture integrates fault\ndetection module and the controller into a unified policy network, effectively\ncombining the adaptability to multiple fault scenarios of PFTC with the\nsuperior control performance of active fault-tolerant control (AFTC). To\noptimize performance, the policy network is trained using a hybrid framework\nthat synergizes reinforcement learning (RL), behavior cloning (BC), and\nsupervised learning with fault information.

In this paper, we propose the flexible projection\n(FP)-type receiver that unify the projection-type receiver and the successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC)-type receiver by using a flexible tradeoff\nfactor to adapt to dynamically changing uplink ISAC scenarios. The FP-type\nreceiver addresses the joint signal detection and target response estimation\nproblem through two coordinated phases: 1) Communication signal detection using\na reconstructed signal whose composition is controlled by the tradeoff factor,\nfollowed by 2) Target response estimation performed through subtraction of the\ndetected communication signal from the received signal. With adjustable\ntradeoff factors, the FP-type receiver can balance the enhancement of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with the reduction of\ncorrelation in the reconstructed signal for communication signal detection. The\npairwise error probabilities (PEPs) are analyzed for both the maximum\nlikelihood (ML) and the zero-forcing (ZF) detectors, revealing that the optimal\ntradeoff factor should be determined based on the adopted detection algorithm\nand the relative power of the sensing and communication (S\\&C) signal. A\nhomotopy optimization framework is first applied for the FP-type receiver with\na fixed trade-off factor. This framework is then extended to develop the\ndynamic FP (DFP)-type receiver, which iteratively adjust the trade-off factor\nfor improved algorithm performance and environmental adaptability.\nSubsequently, two extensions are explored to further enhance the receiver's\nperformance: parallel DFP (PDFP)-type receiver and a block-structured receiver\ndesign. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed receiver designs is verified\nvia simulations.",

Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile\nwith local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic\nhardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by\nBoltzmann distributions builds on the assumption of symmetric connectivity.\nSimilarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the\nweight transport problem between the representation and the error stream.\nExisting solutions such as feedback alignment tend to circumvent the problem by\ndeferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However,\nthey are known to scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce\nspike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking\nneural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the\nasymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being\nspike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise.\nBased on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can\nthereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies\nthat arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of\nphysical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using\ndifferent spiking network models. First, we show how SAL can significantly\nimprove convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking\nnetworks as compared to Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal\nhierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, we show how our proposed mechanism\neffectively enables the alignment of feedback weights to the forward pathway,\nthus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors.",

Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied\nmetal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the\nnucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain\nunanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to\nstructural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges\nbetween particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization\nmechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides\nconcurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not\npreviously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged\nprenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and\nnet positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of\nPNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This\nleads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs)\nwhich incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our\nwork highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension\nin the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel $U(1)_{B-L}$ model with singlet dark matter fermions\ncomposed of WIMP and FIMP, which is anomaly-free without a need for introducing\nright-handed neutrinos. Fermion dark matter masses are generated after the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ is broken spontaneously, so the Yukawa couplings for WIMP and FIMP\ncomponents can be distinguished by the hierarchical values of the vacuum\nexpectation values of the single scalar fields. Moreover, the $U(1)_{B-L}$\ngauge boson receives a TeV-scale mass for a tiny extra gauge coupling, so it\ngoes out of equilibrium from the rest of the model content in the early\nUniverse. Both the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson and FIMP component are produced\nfrom the decays of the bath particles, and the former can decay into FIMP DM\nand/or WIMP DM before BBN. The WIMP component can reside in the resonance\nregion of the Higgs bosons or dominantly annihilate into a pair of singlet-like\nscalars. Thus, there is a flexibility to choose a small mixing between the\nvisible and dark sectors, thereby evading all the current direct and indirect\ndetection bounds. Furthermore, we show that WIMP and FIMP components can\ncoexist in suitable fractions, depending on the choice of model parameters,\nallowing for additional protection for WIMP DM against various experimental\nbounds. Finally, we identify the dimension-6 and dimension-7 operators for\nMajorana neutrino masses in our model, being consistent with the $U(1)_{B-L}$\ngauge symmetry, and provide a possibility of extending the model with\nadditional singlet fermions for neutrino masses.",

In doing so,\nthe challenge comes from two aspects: 1) The absence of an efficient and\neffective annotation method. 2) The absence of a powerful extraction method can\nhandle massive types. For the first challenge, we propose a collaborative\nannotation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through collaboration\namong multiple LLMs, it first refines annotations of trigger words from distant\nsupervision and then carries out argument annotation. Next, a voting phase\nconsolidates the annotation preferences across different LLMs. Finally, we\ncreate the EEMT dataset, the largest EE dataset to date, featuring over 200,000\nsamples, 3,465 event types, and 6,297 role types. For the second challenge, we\npropose an LLM-based Partitioning EE method called LLM-PEE. To overcome the\nlimited context length of LLMs, LLM-PEE first recalls candidate event types and\nthen splits them into multiple partitions for LLMs to extract events. The\nresults in the supervised setting show that LLM-PEE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by 5.4 in event detection and 6.1 in argument\nextraction.

Human risk\npreference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be\neither conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a\nhuman-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level\ndecision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)\nthat incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed\nby a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level\nof RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints\nbased on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To\nfilter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism\nthat pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks\nwith surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the\neffectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample\nefficiency. Simulation experiments in multiple levels of traffic densities show\nthat our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing\ntraffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware\nconstraints in CMDP and action shielding, we can not only adjust the safety\nlevel of the final policy but also reduce safety violations during the training\nstage, proving a promising solution for online learning in real-world\nenvironments.",

To efficiently\nand accurately model lean premixed hydrogen flames, it is crucial to\nincorporate these preferential diffusion effects into flamelet tabulated\nchemistry frameworks, such as the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) method.\nThis is challenging because the preferential diffusion terms in the control\nvariable transport equations contain diffusion fluxes of all species in the\nmechanism.

We propose a physical model based on the Driven Damped Harmonic\nOscillator (DDHO), where self-organizing turbulent structures in the ionic flow\ngenerate oscillating pressure waves and toroidal vortices. These structures\ndrive aqua-ions into resonance, facilitating the shedding of hydration shells\nand enabling ion permeation as free ions.\n  To capture the spatiotemporal complexity of this process, we develop a\nmacroscopic continuum model integrating the Navier--Stokes equations, Gauss's\nlaw, and convection-diffusion dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal strong\noscillations that drive dehydration and ionic jet formation, supporting the\nDDHO mechanism. Model predictions closely match patch-clamp experimental data.\n  The DDHO framework predicts a frequency-dependent resonance response,\neffectively acting as a selective filter. Applied to experimental data, the\nmodel reveals distinct separation between ion species and hydration states,\nquantified by a high Mahalanobis distance and oscillator quality factor.\n  Furthermore, the model provides insight into the effects of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) on ion selectivity. Mutations that alter channel geometry\nshift resonance peaks, disrupting selective transport and potentially leading\nto genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to tackle distribution shifts using unlabeled\ntest data without access to the source data. In the context of multimodal data,\nthere are more complex noise patterns than unimodal data such as simultaneous\ncorruptions for multiple modalities and missing modalities. Besides, in\nreal-world applications, corruptions from different distribution shifts are\nalways mixed. Existing TTA methods always fail in such multimodal scenario\nbecause the abrupt distribution shifts will destroy the prior knowledge from\nthe source model, thus leading to performance degradation. To this end, we\nreveal a new challenge named multimodal wild TTA. To address this challenging\nproblem, we propose two novel strategies: sample identification with\ninterquartile range Smoothing and unimodal assistance, and Mutual information\nsharing (SuMi). SuMi smooths the adaptation process by interquartile range\nwhich avoids the abrupt distribution shifts. Then, SuMi fully utilizes the\nunimodal features to select low-entropy samples with rich multimodal\ninformation for optimization. Furthermore, mutual information sharing is\nintroduced to align the information, reduce the discrepancies and enhance the\ninformation utilization across different modalities. Extensive experiments on\ntwo public datasets show the effectiveness and superiority over existing\nmethods under the complex noise patterns in multimodal data.

However, the role of episodic accretion in the\nformation of brown dwarfs remains mostly unexplored. We investigate the role of\nepisodic accretion, triggered by the magnetorotational instability in the inner\ndisk regions, resulting in episodic outbursts during the formation of brown\ndwarfs, and its implications for their early formation stages. We use\nhydrodynamical simulations coupled with a sub-grid accretion model to\ninvestigate the formation of young proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, taking\ninto account the effects of episodic accretion resulting in episodic radiative\nfeedback, i.e. in luminosity outbursts. The formation timescale for proto brown\ndwarfs is at least one order of magnitude shorter than that of protostars.\nEpisodic accretion leads to a shorter main accretion phase compared to\ncontinuous accretion in brown dwarfs, whereas the opposite is true for low-mass\nstars. Episodic accretion can accelerate early mass accretion in proto-brown\ndwarfs and protostars, but it results in less massive objects by the end of the\nmain phase compared to continuous accretion. We find an approximately linear\ncorrelation between an object's mass at the end of the main accretion phase and\nthe timing of the last episodic outburst: later events result in more massive\nbrown dwarfs but less massive low-mass stars. Episodic outbursts have a\nstronger effect on brown dwarf-forming cloud cores, with the last outburst\nessentially splitting the brown dwarf evolution into a short high-accretion and\na much longer low-accretion phase.",

This information is rich and multimodal in nature.\nExisting multimodal affordance methods face limitations in extracting useful\ninformation, mainly due to simple structural designs, basic fusion methods, and\nlarge model parameters, making it difficult to meet the performance\nrequirements for practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes the BiT-Align image-depth-text affordance mapping framework.

BPM integrates the auxiliary modality\ndepth image directly as a prompt to the primary modality RGB image, embedding\nit into the primary modality encoder without introducing additional encoders.\nThis reduces the model's parameter count and effectively improves functional\nregion localization accuracy. The TFG mechanism guides the selection and\nenhancement of attention heads in the image encoder using textual features,\nimproving the understanding of affordance characteristics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance\nimprovements on public AGD20K and HICO-IIF datasets.

The synergistic\ninteraction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface\nlayers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a\nbutterfly-like symmetrical bipolar S-E curve with a giant apparent strain of\n3.2%.

However, vision-language misalignment\nin MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses\ngenerated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image\ninputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused\non developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual\ninstruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue\nfrom a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core\narchitecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs\nconsisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of the\nearlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from the latter\nmodalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose \\MapleLeaf AKI, a\nnovel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA)\nto enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective\ndesign allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal\nunderstanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional\nparameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be\ngeneric, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to\naccommodate diverse multimodal scenarios.

(EC\n2023, Econometrica 2024) models ambiguous contracts as a collection of classic\ncontracts, with the agent choosing an action that maximizes his worst-case\nutility. In this model, optimal ambiguous contracts have been shown to be\n``simple\" in that they consist of single-outcome payment (SOP) contracts, and\ncan be computed in polynomial-time. However, this simplicity is challenged by\nthe potential need for many classic contracts. Motivated by this, we explore\n\\emph{succinct} ambiguous contracts, where the ambiguous contract is restricted\nto consist of at most $k$ classic contracts. Unlike in the unrestricted case,\nsuccinct ambiguous contracts are no longer composed solely of SOP contracts,\nmaking both their structure and computation more complex.\n  We show that, despite this added complexity, optimal succinct ambiguous\ncontracts are governed by a simple divide-and-conquer principle, showing that\nthey consist of ``shifted min-pay contracts\" for a suitable partition of the\nactions. This structural insight implies a characterization of implementability\nby succinct ambiguous contracts, and can be leveraged to devise an algorithm\nfor the optimal succinct ambiguous contract. While this algorithm is polynomial\nfor $k$ sufficiently close to $n$, for smaller values of $k$, this algorithm is\nexponential, and we show that this is inevitable (unless P=NP) by establishing\nNP-hardness for any constant $k$, or $k=\\beta n$ for some $\\beta\\in(0,1)$.\nFinally, we introduce the succinctness gap measure to quantify the loss\nincurred due to succinctness, and provide upper and lower bounds on this gap.\nInterestingly, in the case where we are missing just a single contract from the\nnumber sufficient to obtain the utility of the unrestricted case, the\nprincipal's utility drops by a factor of $2$, and this is tight.",

However,\nexisting models primarily focus on binary classification (depression/normal),\nlacking granularity for severity assessment. To address this, we proposed the\nDepL-GCN, i.e., Depression Level classification based on GCN model. This model\ntackles two key challenges: (1) subjectivity in depres-sion-level labeling due\nto patient self-report biases, and (2) class imbalance across severity\ncategories. Inspired by the model learning patterns, we introduced two novel\nmodules: the sample confidence module and the minority sample penalty module.\nThe former leverages the L2-norm of prediction errors to progressively filter\nEEG samples with weak label alignment during training, thereby reducing the\nimpact of subjectivity; the latter automatically upweights misclassified\nminority-class samples to address imbalance issues. After testing on two public\nEEG datasets, DepL-GCN achieved accuracies of 81.13% and 81.36% for multi-class\nseverity recognition, outperforming baseline models.Ablation studies confirmed\nboth modules' contributions. We further discussed the strengths and limitations\nof regression-based models for depression-level recognition.",

    "abstract": "In many practical applications of machine learning, a discrepancy often\narises between a source distribution from which labeled training examples are\ndrawn and a target distribution for which only unlabeled data is observed.\nTraditionally, two main scenarios have been considered to address this issue:\ncovariate shift (CS), where only the marginal distribution of features changes,\nand label shift (LS), which involves a change in the class variable's prior\ndistribution. However, these frameworks do not encompass all forms of\ndistributional shift. This paper introduces a new setting, Conditional\nProbability Shift (CPS), which captures the case when the conditional\ndistribution of the class variable given some specific features changes while\nthe distribution of remaining features given the specific features and the\nclass is preserved. For this scenario we present the Conditional Probability\nShift Model (CPSM) based on modeling the class variable's conditional\nprobabilities using multinomial regression. Since the class variable is not\nobserved for the target data, the parameters of the multinomial model for its\ndistribution are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The\nproposed method is generic and can be combined with any probabilistic\nclassifier. The effectiveness of CPSM is demonstrated through experiments on\nsynthetic datasets and a case study using the MIMIC medical database, revealing\nits superior balanced classification accuracy on the target data compared to\nexisting methods, particularly in situations situations of conditional\ndistribution shift and no apriori distribution shift, which are not detected by\nLS-based methods.",

We performed simultaneous observations of the source with the\nEffelsberg 100-m radio telescope, the Thai National Radio Telescope, the\nAstropeiler Stockert, and the X-ray satellite XMM-Newton in May 2024. On May\n23, 2024, we detected 459 bursts from the source using the Ultra-Broad-Band\n(UBB) receiver of the Effelsberg telescope, covering a frequency range from 1.3\nGHz to 6 GHz. All bursts have simultaneous X-ray coverage, which allows us to\nput stringent constraints on the X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio, $\\eta_{x/r}$, of\nFRB 20240114A. In this work, we focus on the three brightest radio bursts\ndetected during the campaign. The brightest burst exhibits a radio fluence of\n$1.4\\times 10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, while the $3\\sigma$ upper limit of the\n0.2$-$12 keV absorption-corrected X-ray burst fluence lies in the range of\n$3.4\\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to $1.7\\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$,\ndepending on the spectral model. Assuming a 10 keV black-body spectrum, the\nX-ray-to-radio fluence ratio can be constrained to\n$\\eta_{x/r}<1.2\\times10^{7}$. A cutoff power law ($\\Gamma=1.56$, cutoff at 84\nkeV) is also considered, physically motivated by the Galactic magnetar SGR\n1935+2154, which has previously shown X-ray bursts associated with FRB-like\nradio bursts at a measured X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio of\n$\\eta_{x/r}\\sim2.5\\times 10^{5}$ (1$-$250 keV).

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map\ngeneration studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning\ncapabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling\ncomplex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under\nadverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper\nproposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with\nCenterline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior\nknowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building\nBEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local\nmapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely\nvisual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates\nhistorical information into mapping generation by applying transformation\nmatrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module\nbased on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through\nspatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction.\nWe construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public\nnuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method\nimproves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and\n240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a test-time guidance method to improve the output quality\nof the human motion diffusion models without requiring additional training. To\nhave negative guidance, Smooth Perturbation Guidance (SPG) builds a weak model\nby temporally smoothing the motion in the denoising steps. Compared to\nmodel-agnostic methods originating from the image generation field, SPG\neffectively mitigates out-of-distribution issues when perturbing motion\ndiffusion models. In SPG guidance, the nature of motion structure remains\nintact. This work conducts a comprehensive analysis across distinct model\narchitectures and tasks. Despite its extremely simple implementation and no\nneed for additional training requirements, SPG consistently enhances motion\nfidelity. Project page can be found at https://spg-blind.vercel.app/",

Nonlinear effects are observed as ultrafast, pump-induced\nchanges in THz transmission, with relative transparency strongly dependent on\nplasmonic mode excitation and saturating at pump fluences of about 200 nJ cm-2.\nThe maximal relative transparency, reaching 45 % at 350 nJ cm -2, occurs under\nresonant excitation of a localized plasmon mode at the strong electrostatic\nmodulation of 2DEG concentration. Transient dynamics reveal ultrafast\nrelaxation times of 15-20 ps, while the effects can be observed at elevated\ntemperatures of up to 150 K. A nonlinear model of plasmonic crystal, based on\nfinite-difference time-domain electrodynamic simulations coupled with viscous\nhydrodynamic electron transport model, elucidates key nonlinear mechanisms,\nincluding near-field effects under metallic gratings, electron heating, plasmon\nresonance broadening, and redshift.

This would help us probe the solar atmosphere at different\nheights and understand the mass and energy transfer process between its layers.\nFor the first time, SUIT will also help us measure spatially resolved solar\nspectral irradiance at this wavelength band, which is significant for studying\nthe sun-climate relationships. To perform these studies, it is necessary to\nphotometrically calibrate the payload and validate the spectral coverage of the\nvarious bandpasses. We perform the photometric calibration and spectral\nvalidation of 8 bandpasses using light of known intensity and spectral\ncoverage. For photometric calibration, the telescope throughput is modeled\nusing sun-as-a-star spectrum from SOLSTICE and SOLSPEC. The modeled throughput\nis compared with in-lab measurements taken with light of known intensity. The\nratio of measured photoelectrons gathered with the modeled prediction agree\nwithin 20%. For spectral validation, readings are taken across the transmission\nspectrum of each filter, keeping adjacent readings independent of each other.\nThe relative intensity measured at each wavelength is seen to trace the modeled\ntelescope bandpass for that filter. These tests could not be performed for\nfilters with bandpasses operating below 250 nm (NB01, BB01 and BB02), primarily\ndue to heavy atmospheric attenuation in these wavelengths leading to decreased\nSNR of the data. The experimentally measured results agree closely with the\nmodeled values, validating SUIT's optical performance and presenting the\nreliability of the developed throughput model.",

Our characterization is model-independent, working under varying\nsynchronicity, failures and message adversaries, as long as the model produces\nruns composed of global states of the system. Furthermore, we show that the\ncohomology of the task sheaf provides a linear algebraic description of the\ndecision space of the processes, and encodes the obstructions to find\nsolutions. This opens way to a computational approach to protocol synthesis,\nwhich we illustrated by deriving a protocol for approximate agreement.

These risks could\narise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascading\neffects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models.\n  In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AI\nindustry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27\nnations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define these\nthresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine and\ndisclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unless\nadequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.''\n  To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, we\noutline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, not\nperfect'' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AI\ncapabilities and consequently evolving risks.

It can be understood as a learned version of\nCLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the\ngrounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture,\nimproving its robustness in terms of generalisability beyond training\nconditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic\nuncertainty. Firstly, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we\nenhance the learning process by randomising Fourier sampling integration times,\nincorporating multi-scan multi-noise configurations, and varying imaging\nsettings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Secondly,\nwe introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops\nwhen the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all\navailable DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by\nreducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the\ndata/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the\nnext DNN. Thirdly, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel\narchitecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide\nactivation, dense connections, weight normalisation, and low-rank convolution\nto improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was\ntrained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) at\nfixed $512 \\times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse\nproblems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model\nconsistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality,\ndata fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.",

It\ncollocates each primary training instance with additional inference instances\non the same GPU, detects the training bubbles and adaptively fills with online\nor offline inference workloads. Our results show that SpecInF can effectively\nenhance GPU utilization under mainstream parallel training modes, delivering\nadditional up to 14$\\times$ offline inference throughputs than TGS and 67\\%\nreduction in online inference p95 latency than MPS, while guaranteeing\ncollocated training throughput.",

    "abstract": "The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation\nand has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting\ndifferent diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used\nprimarily in a centralized approach where the collected data is stored in the\nsame location where nnU-Net is trained. This centralized approach has various\nlimitations, such as potential leakage of sensitive patient information and\nviolation of patient privacy. Federated learning has emerged as a key approach\nfor training segmentation models in a decentralized manner, enabling\ncollaborative development while prioritising patient privacy. In this paper, we\npropose FednnU-Net, a plug-and-play, federated learning extension of the\nnnU-Net framework. To this end, we contribute two federated methodologies to\nunlock decentralized training of nnU-Net, namely, Federated Fingerprint\nExtraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg). We conduct a\ncomprehensive set of experiments demonstrating high and consistent performance\nof our methods for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation based on a\nmulti-modal collection of 6 datasets representing samples from 18 different\ninstitutions.

    "abstract": "Palm vein recognition is an emerging biometric technology that offers\nenhanced security and privacy. However, acquiring sufficient palm vein data for\ntraining deep learning-based recognition models is challenging due to the high\ncosts of data collection and privacy protection constraints. This has led to a\ngrowing interest in generating pseudo-palm vein data using generative models.\nExisting methods, however, often produce unrealistic palm vein patterns or\nstruggle with controlling identity and style attributes. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel palm vein generation framework named PVTree. First,\nthe palm vein identity is defined by a complex and authentic 3D palm vascular\ntree, created using an improved Constrained Constructive Optimization (CCO)\nalgorithm. Second, palm vein patterns of the same identity are generated by\nprojecting the same 3D vascular tree into 2D images from different views and\nconverting them into realistic images using a generative model. As a result,\nPVTree satisfies the need for both identity consistency and intra-class\ndiversity. Extensive experiments conducted on several publicly available\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed palm vein generation method surpasses\nexisting methods and achieves a higher TAR@FAR=1e-4 under the 1:1 Open-set\nprotocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the\nperformance of a recognition model trained on synthetic palm vein data exceeds\nthat of the recognition model trained on real data, which indicates that palm\nvein image generation research has a promising future.",

The\ncollected liners represented a broad range of both traditional and modern\nUHMWPE formulations, which differed by the level of crosslinking, type of\nthermal treatment, sterilization and/or stabilization. All obtained UHMWPE's\nwere characterized by multiple methods immediately after purchase and after the\naccelerated aging in H2O2.

The investigated UHMWPE liners exhibited significant\ndifferences in their properties, namely in their resistance to long term\noxidative degradation. The stiffness-related mechanical properties showed a\nstrong correlation with the overall crystallinity. The crystallinity depended\nmostly on the oxidative degradation of the UHMWPE liners, while the thermal\ntreatment played a minor role.

However, existing works\npredominantly rely exclusively on image data, lack interpretability in their\ndiagnostic decisions, and treat medical professionals primarily as annotators\nfor ground truth labeling. To fill this gap, we implement two key strategies:\nextracting interpretable concepts of retinal diseases using the knowledge base\nof GPT models and incorporating these concepts as a language component in\nprompt-learning to train vision-language (VL) models with both fundus images\nand their associated concepts. Our method not only improves retinal disease\nclassification but also enriches few-shot and zero-shot detection (novel\ndisease detection), while offering the added benefit of concept-based model\ninterpretability. Our extensive evaluation across two diverse retinal fundus\nimage datasets illustrates substantial performance gains in VL-model based\nfew-shot methodologies through our concept integration approach, demonstrating\nan average improvement of approximately 5.8\\% and 2.7\\% mean average precision\nfor 16-shot learning and zero-shot (novel class) detection respectively.

The shape of ideal knots has been extensively studied in the\ncontext of knot theory, while that of physical knots has been discussed very\nrecently. The complex interplay of elasticity and geometry, such as bending,\ntwisting, and contact, needs to be disentangled to predict their deformation.\nStill, the unified understanding of the deformation of physical knots is\ninsufficient. Here, we focus on the trefoil knot, a closed knot with a\nnontrivial topology, and study the relationship between the shapes of the\ntrefoil knot and applied physical twists, combining experiments and\nsimulations. As we twist the elastomeric rod, the knot becomes either tightened\nor loosened, preserving the original three-fold symmetry, and then buckles and\nexhibits symmetry breaking at critical angles. The curvature profiles computed\nthrough the X-ray tomography analysis also exhibit similar symmetry breaking.\nThe transition would be triggered by the mechanical instability, where the\nimposed twist energy is converted into the bending energy. The phase transition\nobserved here is analogous to the classical buckling phenomena of elastic rings\nknown as the Michell instability. We find that the twist buckling instability\nof the trefoil knot results from the interplay of bending, twisting, and\ncontact properties of the rod. In other words, the buckling of the knot is\npredictable based on the elasticity and geometry of rods, which would be useful\nin avoiding or even utilizing their buckling in practical engineering\napplications such as surgery and the shipping industry.",

Using theoretical frameworks for the analysis\nof neural networks, we show a strong dependence of specialisation on the\ninitial condition. More precisely, we show that weight imbalance and high\nweight entropy can favour specialised solutions. We then apply these insights\nin the context of continual learning, first showing the emergence of a\nmonotonic relation between task-similarity and forgetting in non-specialised\nnetworks. {Finally, we show that specialization by weight imbalance is\nbeneficial on the commonly employed elastic weight consolidation regularisation\ntechnique.",

This study develops a replicable\nnational approach to identifying and characterising forest ecosystems, with a\nfocus on the role of secondary forests. We hypothesised that dominant tree\nspecies in the forest canopy serve as reliable indicators for delineating\nforest ecosystems and untangling biodiversity complexity. Using national\ninventories, we identified in situ clusters through hierarchical clustering\nbased on dominant species abundance dissimilarity, determined using the\nImportance Variable Index. These clusters were characterised by analysing\nspecies assemblages and their interactions. We then applied object-oriented\nRandom Forest modelling, segmenting the national forest cover using NDVI to\nidentify the forest ecosystems derived from in situ clusters. Freely available\nspectral (Sentinel-2) and environmental data were used in the model to\ndelineate and characterise key forest ecosystems. We finished with an\nassessment of distribution of secondary and old-growth forests within\necosystems. In Costa Rica, 495 dominant tree species defined 10 in situ\nclusters, with 7 main clusters successfully modelled. The modelling (F1-score:\n0.73, macro F1-score: 0.58) and species-based characterisation highlighted the\nmain ecological trends of these ecosystems, which are distinguished by specific\nspecies dominance, topography, climate, and vegetation dynamics, aligning with\nlocal forest classifications. The analysis of secondary forest distribution\nprovided an initial assessment of ecosystem vulnerability by evaluating their\nrole in forest maintenance and dynamics. This approach also underscored the\nmajor challenge of in situ data acquisition",

To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called\nGenerator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better\ndecision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator\nto interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action\nproduced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation\nupon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional\nstrategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its\neffectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant\nimprovements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our\nanalysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust\nplug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.",

    "abstract": "Demonstrating quantum advantage has been a pressing challenge in the field. A\nmajority of claimed quantum speedups rely on a subroutine in which classical\ninformation can be accessed in a coherent quantum manner, which imposes a\ncrucial constraint on the practicability of these quantum algorithms. It has\neven been shown that without such an access, the quantum computer cannot be\n(exponentially) stronger than the classical counterpart for many problems.\nThus, whether or not a quantum computer can be useful for practical\napplications has been central to investigation. In this work, we develop a\nquantum gradient descent algorithm for polynomial optimization, which is a\nfundamental technique that enjoys a wide range of applications. The algorithm's\nrunning time is logarithmical relative to the number of variables and consumes\nlogarithmic numbers of qubits. Our method can work with many classes of\npolynomials and, most importantly, it removes the requirement for such a\ncoherent quantum access. Thus, it implies great potential for near-term\nrealization and particularly surpasses the belief that quantum speedup is only\npossible with strong input assumptions. As immediate applications, we show how\nto translate the capability of performing gradient descent into solving a\nlinear system, performing least-square fitting, building a support vector\nmachine, performing supervised cluster assignment, training neural network, and\nsolving for ground-state/excited-state energy, performing principle component\nanalysis, with end-to-end applications of quantum algorithms. Thus, our result\nadds another prominent example to some existing literature, provably\ndemonstrating the quantum advantage toward highly practical problems,\nsuggesting a new and promising prospect for the real-world application of a\nquantum computer.",

Although Vision Transformer (ViT) solutions deliver\nhigh accuracy, their large models often exceed the memory and compute budgets\nof resource-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile robots.

Experiments on standard VPR benchmarks demonstrate that TeTRA\nreduces memory consumption by up to 69% compared to efficient baselines, while\nlowering inference latency by 35%, with either no loss or a slight improvement\nin recall@1. These gains enable high-accuracy VPR on power-constrained,\nmemory-limited robotic platforms, making TeTRA an appealing solution for\nreal-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the trade-off between internalisation and\nexternalisation in the management of stochastic trade flows. We consider agents\nwho must absorb flows and manage risk by deciding whether to warehouse it or\nhedge in the market, thereby incurring transaction costs and market impact.\nUnlike market makers, these agents cannot skew their quotes to attract\noffsetting flows and deter risk-increasing ones, leading to a fundamentally\ndifferent problem. Within the Almgren-Chriss framework, we derive\nalmost-closed-form solutions in the case of quadratic execution costs, while\nmore general cases require numerical methods. In particular, we discuss the\nchallenges posed by artificial boundary conditions when using classical\ngrid-based numerical PDE techniques and propose reinforcement learning methods\nas an alternative.",

(2) We developed two routing\nparadigms: patch-wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing\nacross different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including\nSelective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We\ndevelop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and\noptimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments\ndemonstrate that the UoE model surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and\nefficient transformers (including the model architecture of recently proposed\nDeepSeek-V3) in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In\nlanguage modeling tasks, we achieve an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity\ncompared to the best-performed MoE method with an average of 76% FLOPs.

Existing RRW methods, mostly non-deep learning-based, face\ncomplex designs, high computational costs, and poor robustness, limiting their\npractical use. This paper proposes Deep Robust Reversible Watermarking (DRRW),\na deep learning-based RRW scheme. DRRW uses an Integer Invertible Watermark\nNetwork (iIWN) to map integer data distributions invertibly, addressing\nconventional RRW limitations. Unlike traditional RRW, which needs\ndistortion-specific designs, DRRW employs an encoder-noise layer-decoder\nframework for adaptive robustness via end-to-end training. In inference, cover\nimage and watermark map to an overflowed stego image and latent variables,\ncompressed by arithmetic coding into a bitstream embedded via reversible data\nhiding for lossless recovery. We introduce an overflow penalty loss to reduce\npixel overflow, shortening the auxiliary bitstream while enhancing robustness\nand stego image quality. An adaptive weight adjustment strategy avoids manual\nwatermark loss weighting, improving training stability and performance.\nExperiments show DRRW outperforms state-of-the-art RRW methods, boosting\nrobustness and cutting embedding, extraction, and recovery complexities by\n55.14\\(\\times\\), 5.95\\(\\times\\), and 3.57\\(\\times\\), respectively.

Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to\npixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range\nis pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing\ntraditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments.\nIn this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional\nframe-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that\ncombine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based\nlow-light image restoration framework named ERetinex.

This method outperforms traditional\nimage-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more\nprecise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion\nstrategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the\ncolor information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this\nfusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the\nintegrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions.

The resulting model, termed the \\b{eta}-Transport\nmodel, demonstrates high accuracy across various separated flows outside the\ntraining set, including periodic hills with different geometries and Reynolds\nnumbers, the curved backward-facing step, a two-dimensional bump, and a\nthree-dimensional simplified car body. In all tested cases, the\n\\b{eta}-Transport model yields smaller or equal prediction errors compared to\nthose from classic local data-driven turbulence models using algebraic\nrelations for \\b{eta}. These results indicate improved generalizability for\nseparated flows. Furthermore, the \\b{eta}-Transport model shows similar\naccuracy to the baseline model in basic flows including the mixing layer and\nthe channel flow. Therefore, the non-local modeling approach presented here\noffers a promising pathway for developing more generalizable data-driven\nturbulence models.",

    "abstract": "Registration of diffusion MRI tractography is an essential step for analyzing\ngroup similarities and variations in the brain's white matter (WM).\nStreamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric\ninformation of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration.\nExisting methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to\nidentify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point\nconnectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to\nidentify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work,\nwe propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform\nstreamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to\nidentify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of\ntractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the\ngraph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection\nmethod for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to\nidentify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline\nsets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly\neffective and efficient tractography registration performance.",

However, the atomic-scale mechanisms behind\nthis enhancement remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the carrier\ntransport mechanisms in Cs2A'Bi2I9 (A' = Ag, Cu) using first-principles\ncalculations and Boltzmann transport calculations. Our results reveal that\nA-site ordered Cs2A'Bi2I9 exhibits carrier mobilities that are 3-4 times higher\nthan those of Cs3Bi2I9 within the 100-500 K temperature range. We identify\npolar phonon scattering as the dominant mechanism limiting mobility.\nFurthermore, the enhanced out-of-plane carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9,\nparticularly between 100 and 200K, leads to reduced mobility anisotropy. These\nimprovements are mainly due to the shorter A'-I bond lengths and increased\nAg+/Cu+ s-I p orbital coupling. Notably, substitution with Cu+ results in a\nfurther reduction in the band gap and enhanced hole mobility compared to Ag+\nsubstitution in Cs3Bi2I9. Further analysis reveals that the significant\nincrease in carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9 can be largely explained by the\nsmaller carrier effective masses (m*) and weaker Fr\\\"ohlich coupling strengths\n({\\alpha}), resulting in a lower polar mass {\\alpha}(m*/me), compared to\nCs3Bi2I9.

These observations seem to be\nin direct conflict with a homogeneous and isotropic Universe as asserted by the\ncosmological principle, demanding further investigation into the origin of the\ntension. Here, we investigate whether the observed number count dipoles are\nconsistent with being fully kinematic or if there is any residual anisotropy\ncontributing to the total observed dipole. To disentangle these contributions,\nwe aim to leverage the fact that the kinematic matter dipole expected in a\ngiven galaxy catalogue scales with observed properties of the sample, and\ndifferent catalogues used in the literature therefore have different kinematic\ndipole expectations. We here perform joint dipole fits using the NRAO VLA Sky\nSurvey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), and the AGN catalogue\nderived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (CatWISE). Assuming a\ncommon kinematic and non-kinematic dipole component between all catalogues, we\nfind that a large residual, non-kinematic dipole anisotropy is detected, though\na common direction between the two components is disfavoured by model\nselection. Freeing up both amplitude and direction for this residual dipole\nwhile fixing the kinematic dipole to the CMB dipole expectation, we recover a\nsignificant residual dipole with $\\mathcal{D}_{resid} =\n(0.81\\pm0.14)\\times10^{-2}$, that is offset from the CMB dipole direction by\n$39\\pm8$ degrees.

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on late-time cosmic acceleration within modified theories\nof gravity, using various observational data sets and statistical analysis. The\nUniverse is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic and is described\nby the Friedmann Lema\\^{i}tre Robertson Walker metric. The late-time\nacceleration of the Universe has posed a significant challenge to contemporary\ncosmology. General relativity addresses this by introducing the cosmological\nconstant, forming the basis of the standard cosmological model ($\\Lambda$CDM).\nHowever, this model has limitations, leading cosmologists to explore\nalternative explanations for late-time acceleration. These alternatives range\nfrom models involving a dynamic dark fluid known as dark energy, to large-scale\nmodifications of gravitational interaction, known as modified gravity. The\nformulation of general relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of\ngravitation, redefining gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of\nspacetime rather than a force as described by Newton. Despite its success,\ngeneral relativity has shown incompatibilities with observations, necessitating\nthe introduction of dark matter and dark energy....",

In order to address these scenarios, a rapid SAR\nsystem, UAV-VLRR (Vision-Language-Rapid-Response), is developed in this\nresearch. This system consists of two aspects: 1) A multimodal system which\nharnesses the power of Visual Language Model (VLM) and the natural language\nprocessing capabilities of ChatGPT-4o (LLM) for scene interpretation. 2) A\nnon-linearmodel predictive control (NMPC) with built-in obstacle avoidance for\nrapid response by a drone to fly according to the output of the multimodal\nsystem. This work aims at improving response times in emergency SAR operations\nby providing a more intuitive and natural approach to the operator to plan the\nSAR mission while allowing the drone to carry out that mission in a rapid and\nsafe manner.

    "abstract": "Objective: ascending aortic aneurysm growth prediction is still challenging\nin clinics. In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of local and\nglobal shape features to predict ascending aortic aneurysm growth.\n  Material and methods: 70 patients with aneurysm, for which two 3D\nacquisitions were available, are included. Following segmentation, three local\nshape features are computed: (1) the ratio between maximum diameter and length\nof the ascending aorta centerline, (2) the ratio between the length of external\nand internal lines on the ascending aorta and (3) the tortuosity of the\nascending tract. By exploiting longitudinal data, the aneurysm growth rate is\nderived. Using radial basis function mesh morphing, iso-topological surface\nmeshes are created. Statistical shape analysis is performed through\nunsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least\nsquares (PLS). Two types of global shape features are identified: three\nPCA-derived and three PLS-based shape modes. Three regression models are set\nfor growth prediction: two based on gaussian support vector machine using local\nand PCA-derived global shape features; the third is a PLS linear regression\nmodel based on the related global shape features. The prediction results are\nassessed and the aortic shapes most prone to growth are identified.\n  Results: the prediction root mean square error from leave-one-out\ncross-validation is: 0.112 mm/month, 0.083 mm/month and 0.066 mm/month for\nlocal, PCA-based and PLS-derived shape features, respectively. Aneurysms close\nto the root with a large initial diameter report faster growth.\n  Conclusion: global shape features might provide an important contribution for\npredicting the aneurysm growth.",

However, various practical constraints such as API costs,\ncopyright, legal and ethical policies restrict using large (often opaque)\nmodels to train smaller models for commercial use. Limited success has been\nachieved at improving the ability of an SLM to explore the space of possible\nrationales and evaluate them by itself through self-deliberation. To address\nthis, we propose COALITION, a trainable framework that facilitates interaction\nbetween two variants of the same SLM and trains them to generate and refine\nrationales optimized for the end-task. The variants exhibit different behaviors\nto produce a set of diverse candidate rationales during the generation and\nrefinement steps. The model is then trained via Selective Rationale\nOptimization (SRO) to prefer generating rationale candidates that maximize the\nlikelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. During inference, COALITION\nemploys a controller to select the suitable variant for generating and refining\nthe rationales. On five different datasets covering mathematical problems,\ncommonsense reasoning, and natural language inference, COALITION outperforms\nseveral baselines by up to 5%.

While existing methods primarily\nfocus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of\nsportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human\nracing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent\ndangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems\noften lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to\nunsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to\nintegrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing.

At the low level, vehicle\ninteractions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP),\nensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing\ntheir trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining\ncompetitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and\ndefenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of\nthese constraints influences strategic decision-making.

Mock\ndatasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched\nnucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a\nsimulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based\ninference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to\nsystematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\\sim75,600\\times$ speed-up compared\nto HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for\nthousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the\nIMF slope ($\\alpha_{\\rm IMF} = -2.298 \\pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization\n($\\log_{10}(N_{\\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \\pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from\nthe ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model\nmisspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate\nyield tables or data from a cosmological simulation. (shortened...)",

During inference, COBRA employs a coarse-to-fine\nstrategy, starting with sparse ID generation and refining them into dense\nvectors via the generative model. We further propose BeamFusion, an innovative\napproach combining beam search with nearest neighbor scores to enhance\ninference flexibility and recommendation diversity.

Super Earths presumably are rocky planets with a thin secondary\natmosphere, whereas gas dwarfs have a substantial (by volume) primary H/He\natmosphere.

    "abstract": "Security researchers grapple with the surge of malicious files, necessitating\nswift identification and classification of malware strains for effective\nprotection. Visual classifiers and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) have emerged as vital tools for this task. However, issues of robustness\nand explainability, common in other high risk domain like medicine and\nautonomous vehicles, remain understudied in current literature. Although deep\nlearning visualization classifiers presented in research obtain great results\nwithout the need for expert feature extraction, they have not been properly\nstudied in terms of their replicability. Additionally, the literature is not\nclear on how these types of classifiers arrive to their answers. Our study\naddresses these gaps by replicating six CNN models and exploring their\npitfalls. We employ Class Activation Maps (CAMs), like GradCAM and HiResCAM, to\nassess model explainability. We evaluate the CNNs' performance and\ninterpretability on two standard datasets, MalImg and Big2015, and a newly\ncreated called VX-Zoo. We employ these different CAM techniques to gauge the\nexplainability of each of the models. With these tools, we investigate the\nunderlying factors contributing to different interpretations of inputs across\nthe different models, empowering human researchers to discern patterns crucial\nfor identifying distinct malware families and explain why CNN models arrive at\ntheir conclusions. Other then highlighting the patterns found in the\ninterpretability study, we employ the extracted heatmpas to enhance Visual\nTransformers classifiers' performance and explanation quality. This approach\nyields substantial improvements in F1 score, ranging from 2% to 8%, across the\ndatasets compared to benchmark values.",

Existing studies\nprimarily focus on optimizing model training distribution strategies to\nminimize memory footprint and enhance training speed, often overlooking the\nscalability challenges related to model size and hardware constraints. To\naddress this oversight, we thoroughly investigate computational, memory, and\nnetwork demands of training large transformers using the Fully Sharded Data\nParallel (FSDP) distributed strategy across different hardware clusters. We\nexplore the intricate relationships between model size and hardware setups to\nidentify configurations that ensure maximum model and hardware efficiency,\neffective sequence length management, and optimal training throughput. A\nsignificant finding of our study is the critical interplay of the cluster's\nconnection bandwidth and GPU memory size compared to the computational\nperformance of GPUs. This interplay limits training efficiency, underscoring\nthe role of both hardware characteristics as a possible bottleneck. By\nintegrating theoretical analysis with simulations and empirical tests, we\ndemonstrate how hardware limitations affect training efficacy, identifying key\nhardware thresholds and the impact of network connectivity.

The translation process is divided into three\nstages: (i) natural language preprocessing, (ii) natural language\nunderstanding, and (iii) natural language translation. Traditional and\ndata-driven methods are utilized in the preprocessing stage. Traditional\napproaches rely on predefined rules and grammars, and involve techniques such\nas regular expressions, dependency parsing and named entity recognition.\nData-driven approaches depend on large-scale data and machine learning models,\nusing techniques including word embedding and pattern linking. Natural language\nunderstanding methods are classified into three categories: (i) rule-based,\n(ii) machine learning-based, and (iii) hybrid. We then describe a general\nconstruction process for executable languages over relational and\nspatio-temporal databases. Subsequently, common benchmarks and evaluation\nmetrics for transforming natural language into executable language are\npresented, and methods for generating new benchmarks are explored.

In this problem, the $n$ arms\nare present in a stream, and at most $m<n$ arms and their statistics can be\nstored in the memory. We establish tight non-asymptotic regret bounds regarding\nall relevant parameters, including the number of arms $n$, the memory size $m$,\nthe number of rounds $T$ and $(\\Delta_i)_{i\\in [n]}$ where $\\Delta_i$ is the\nreward mean gap between the best arm and the $i$-th arm. These gaps are not\nknown in advance by the player. Specifically, for any constant $\\alpha \\ge 1$,\nwe present two algorithms: one applicable for $m\\ge \\frac{2}{3}n$ with regret\nat most $O_\\alpha\\Big(\\frac{(n-m)T^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}}{n^{1 +\n{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i:\\Delta_i > 0}\\Delta_i^{1 -\n2\\alpha}\\Big)$ and another applicable for $m<\\frac{2}{3}n$ with regret at most\n$O_\\alpha\\Big(\\frac{T^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}}{m^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i:\\Delta_i\n> 0}\\Delta_i^{1 - 2\\alpha}\\Big)$.

At each discrete-time round, all\nvertices update their opinions simultaneously according to a given protocol.\nThe goal is to reach a consensus, where all vertices support the same opinion.\nIn 3-Majority, each vertex chooses three random neighbors with replacement and\nupdates its opinion to match the majority, with ties broken randomly. In\n2-Choices, each vertex chooses two random neighbors with replacement.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection, yet existing\nmethods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a\ntraining set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often\ncomplicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting\ndetection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local\nvariations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal\ninformation remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more\naligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information\noriginate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external\nnormality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that\nextracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image.\nSpecifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal\ntokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure\nINPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then\nguide the INP-Guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with\nreconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a\nSoft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training.\nINP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class,\nand few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a\nversatile and universal solution for AD.

This paper\nproposes a novel end-to-end framework for addressing the challenges associated\nwith deep learning in mesh models centered around graph neural networks (GNN)\nand is titled InfoGNN. InfoGNN treats the mesh model as a graph, which enables\nit to handle irregular mesh data efficiently. Moreover, we propose InfoConv and\nInfoMP modules, which utilize the position information of the points and fully\nuse the static information such as face normals, dihedral angles, and dynamic\nglobal feature information to fully use all kinds of data. In addition, InfoGNN\nis an end-to-end framework, and we simplify the network design to make it more\nefficient, paving the way for efficient deep learning of complex 3D models. We\nconducted experiments on several publicly available datasets, and the results\nshow that InfoGNN achieves excellent performance in mesh classification and\nsegmentation tasks.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary goals of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research is to\ndevelop robots that can interpret human behavior and adapt their responses\naccordingly. Adaptive learning models, such as continual and reinforcement\nlearning, play a crucial role in improving robots' ability to interact\neffectively in real-world settings. However, these models face significant\nchallenges due to the limited availability of real-world data, particularly in\nsensitive domains like healthcare and well-being. This data scarcity can hinder\na robot's ability to adapt to new situations. To address these challenges,\ncausality provides a structured framework for understanding and modeling the\nunderlying relationships between actions, events, and outcomes. By moving\nbeyond mere pattern recognition, causality enables robots to make more\nexplainable and generalizable decisions. This paper presents an exploratory\ncausality-based analysis through a case study of an adaptive robotic coach\ndelivering positive psychology exercises over four weeks in a workplace\nsetting. The robotic coach autonomously adapts to multimodal human behaviors,\nsuch as facial valence and speech duration. By conducting both macro- and\nmicro-level causal analyses, this study aims to gain deeper insights into how\nadaptability can enhance well-being during interactions. Ultimately, this\nresearch seeks to advance our understanding of how causality can help overcome\nchallenges in HRI, particularly in real-world applications.",

In [10], we studied the dynamics of the family on these graphs.\nIn particular, we described whether the topological entropy associated with the\nmap on the graph is positive or zero in terms of the parameter $c=-b/a$.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software\napplications, with prompts serving as the primary 'programming' interface to\nguide their behavior. As a result, a new software paradigm, promptware, has\nemerged, using natural language prompts to interact with LLMs and enabling\ncomplex tasks without traditional coding. Unlike traditional software, which\nrelies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments,\npromptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural\nlanguage and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic\nand non-deterministic. These fundamental differences introduce unique\nchallenges in prompt development. In practice, prompt development is largely ad\nhoc and experimental, relying on a time-consuming trial-and-error process - a\nchallenge we term the 'promptware crisis.' To address this, we propose\npromptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established software\nengineering principles to the process of prompt development. Building on\ndecades of success in traditional software engineering, we envision a\nsystematic framework that includes prompt requirements engineering, design,\nimplementation, testing, debugging, and evolution. Unlike traditional software\nengineering, our framework is specifically tailored to the unique\ncharacteristics of prompt development. This paper outlines a comprehensive\nroadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and\noffering actionable insights to advance LLM-based software development.",

Typically, these profiles are constructed by leveraging LLMs\nfor user profile modeling (LLM-UM). However, this process faces several\nchallenges: (1) LLMs struggle with long user behaviors due to context length\nlimitations and performance degradation. (2) Existing methods often extract\nonly partial segments from full historical behavior sequence, inevitably\ndiscarding diverse user interests embedded in the omitted content, leading to\nincomplete modeling and suboptimal profiling. (3) User profiling is often\ntightly coupled with the inference context, requiring online processing, which\nintroduces significant latency overhead. In this paper, we propose PersonaX, an\nagent-agnostic LLM-UM framework to address these challenges. It augments\ndownstream recommendation agents to achieve better recommendation performance\nand inference efficiency. PersonaX (a) segments complete historical behaviors\ninto clustered groups, (b) selects multiple sub behavior sequences (SBS) with a\nbalance of prototypicality and diversity to form a high quality core set, (c)\nperforms offline multi-persona profiling to capture diverse user interests and\ngenerate fine grained, cached textual personas, and (d) decouples user\nprofiling from online inference, enabling profile retrieval instead of real\ntime generation.

To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full\nbinarization model with the guidance of three important observations.\nInitially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical\nfeature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant\ncomputations stemming from excessive tokens.

This formulation presents significant\ncomputational challenges due to its multi-block structure, non-convexity,\nnon-smoothness, and the absence of global gradient Lipschitz continuity. To\naddress these challenges, we develop an accelerated alternating partial Bregman\nproximal gradient method (AAPB), whose distinctive feature lies in its\ncapability to enable simultaneous updates of multiple variables. Under mild and\ntheoretically justified assumptions, we establish both sublinear and global\nconvergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Through careful selection of\nkernel generating distances tailored to various regularization terms, we derive\ncorresponding closed-form solutions while maintaining the $L$-smooth adaptable\nproperty always holds for any $L\\ge 1$. Numerical experiments, on graph\nregularized clustering and sparse NMF basis compression confirm the\neffectiveness of our model and algorithm.",

This study investigates the mixing of hohlraum ablated Au plasmas\nand filling C$_5$H$_{12}$ plasmas using one-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations. We find that ion-ion collisions slow the diffusion of ions,\nrendering Au ions sub-diffusive, while C and H ions remain super-diffusive. Due\nto their lower collisionality, H ions diffuse faster into Au regions than C\nions, leading to a distinct separation between C and H ions at the interface.\nAlthough an electrostatic shock is still generated at the plasma interface in\nthe presence of collisions, its electric field strength and propagation speed\nare notably reduced. To systematically explore plasma mixing in hohlraum\nenvironments, we evaluate the individual effects of incident laser irradiation,\nplasma flow, and inhomogeneous density profiles on ion mixing. We find that\nlaser irradiation and plasma flow have a minor impact on ion mixing compared to\ndiffusion-driven processes, while the inhomogeneous density profile restricts\ndiffusion from low-density to high-density regions. By incorporating realistic\nhohlraum plasma conditions derived from radiation hydrodynamic models into the\nPIC simulations, we demonstrate that the diffusion of C and H ions continues to\ndominate ion mixing. Simple phenomenological fits are derived to describe the\nevolution of the mixing width in a hohlraum condition. Further theoretical\ncalculations indicate that the penetration of H and C into Au plasmas\nsuppresses stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) within the mixing layer. This\nfinding underscores the importance of integrating ion mixing effects into LPI\ncodes for more accurate modeling of ICF hohlraum dynamics.",

    "abstract": "A main bottleneck of learning-based robotic scene understanding methods is\nthe heavy reliance on extensive annotated training data, which often limits\ntheir generalization ability. In LiDAR panoptic segmentation, this challenge\nbecomes even more pronounced due to the need to simultaneously address both\nsemantic and instance segmentation from complex, high-dimensional point cloud\ndata. In this work, we address the challenge of LiDAR panoptic segmentation\nwith very few labeled samples by leveraging recent advances in label-efficient\nvision panoptic segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel method,\nLimited-Label LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (L3PS), which requires only a minimal\namount of labeled data. Our approach first utilizes a label-efficient 2D\nnetwork to generate panoptic pseudo-labels from a small set of annotated\nimages, which are subsequently projected onto point clouds. We then introduce a\nnovel 3D refinement module that capitalizes on the geometric properties of\npoint clouds. By incorporating clustering techniques, sequential scan\naccumulation, and ground point separation, this module significantly enhances\nthe accuracy of the pseudo-labels, improving segmentation quality by up to\n+10.6 PQ and +7.9 mIoU. We demonstrate that these refined pseudo-labels can be\nused to effectively train off-the-shelf LiDAR segmentation networks. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that L3PS not only outperforms existing methods\nbut also substantially reduces the annotation burden.

Manual\nevaluation, while comprehensive, is often costly and resource-intensive.\nConversely, automatic evaluation offers greater scalability but is constrained\nby the limitations of its evaluation criteria (dominated by reference-based\nanswers). To address these challenges, NTCIR-18 introduced the AEOLLM\n(Automatic Evaluation of LLMs) task, aiming to encourage reference-free\nevaluation methods that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In\nthis paper, to enhance the evaluation performance of the AEOLLM task, we\npropose three key methods to improve the reference-free evaluation: 1)\nMulti-model Collaboration: Leveraging multiple LLMs to approximate human\nratings across various subtasks; 2) Prompt Auto-optimization: Utilizing LLMs to\niteratively refine the initial task prompts based on evaluation feedback from\ntraining samples; and 3) In-context Learning (ICL) Optimization: Based on the\nmulti-task evaluation feedback, we train a specialized in-context example\nretrieval model, combined with a semantic relevance retrieval model, to jointly\nidentify the most effective in-context learning examples.

    "abstract": "Selecting high-quality and diverse training samples from extensive datasets\nplays a crucial role in reducing training overhead and enhancing the\nperformance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies fall\nshort in assessing the overall value of selected data, focusing primarily on\nindividual quality, and struggle to strike an effective balance between\nensuring diversity and minimizing data point traversals. Therefore, this paper\nintroduces a novel choice-based sample selection framework that shifts the\nfocus from evaluating individual sample quality to comparing the contribution\nvalue of different samples when incorporated into the subset. Thanks to the\nadvanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we utilize LLMs to\nevaluate the value of each option during the selection process. Furthermore, we\ndesign a greedy sampling process where samples are incrementally added to the\nsubset, thereby improving efficiency by eliminating the need for exhaustive\ntraversal of the entire dataset with the limited budget. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that selected data from our method not only surpass the performance\nof the full dataset but also achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) studies, while requiring fewer selections.

Integrating this scheduling mechanism with existing pipeline\nscheduling algorithms further enhances the performance of distributed training.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared with Megatron-LM, ChunkFlow can\nbe up to 4.53x faster in the long context fine-tuning of LLMs. Furthermore, we\nbelieve that ChunkFlow serves as an effective solution for a broader range of\nscenarios, such as long context continual pre-training, where datasets contain\nvariable-length sequences.",

    "abstract": "The detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) from clinical MRI data is an active\narea of research in medical imaging. Recent advances in quantum computing,\nparticularly the integration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with\nclassical machine learning architectures, offer new opportunities to develop\nmodels that may outperform traditional methods. However, quantum machine\nlearning (QML) remains in its early stages and requires further experimental\nanalysis to better understand its behavior and limitations. In this paper, we\npropose an end to end hybrid classical quantum convolutional neural network (CQ\nCNN) for AD detection using clinically formatted 3D MRI data. Our approach\ninvolves developing a framework to make 3D MRI data usable for machine\nlearning, designing and training a brain tissue segmentation model (Skull Net),\nand training a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for the minority\nclass. Our converged models exhibit potential quantum advantages, achieving\nhigher accuracy in fewer epochs than classical models. The proposed beta8 3\nqubit model achieves an accuracy of 97.50%, surpassing state of the art (SOTA)\nmodels while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. In\nparticular, the architecture employs only 13K parameters (0.48 MB), reducing\nthe parameter count by more than 99.99% compared to current SOTA models.\nFurthermore, the diffusion-generated data used to train our quantum models, in\nconjunction with real samples, preserve clinical structural standards,\nrepresenting a notable first in the field of QML. We conclude that CQCNN\narchitecture like models, with further improvements in gradient optimization\ntechniques, could become a viable option and even a potential alternative to\nclassical models for AD detection, especially in data limited and resource\nconstrained clinical settings.",

Under the\nsimplifying assumption of external charges, charged states are formed from\nneutral pairs of opposite charges, with one charge being shifted to light-like\ninfinity. It thereby escapes observation. Despite the fact that this charge\nmoves asymptotically at the speed of light, the resulting electromagnetic field\nhas a well-defined energy operator that is bounded from below. Moreover, due to\nthe spatiotemporal restrictions, the transverse electromagnetic field (the\nradiation) has no infrared singularities in the light cone. They are quenched\nand the observed radiation can be described by states in the Fock space of\nphotons. The longitudinal field between the charges (giving rise to Gauss's\nlaw) disappears for inertial observers in an instant. This is consistent with\nthe fact that there is no evidence for the existence of longitudinal photons.\nThe results show that the restrictions of operations and observations to light\ncones, which are dictated by the arrow of time, amount to a Lorentz-invariant\ninfrared cutoff.",

A total of 3,245 images were\ncollected from the experimental tower of H Company, the leading elevator\nmanufacturer in South Korea, and the detection performance was evaluated using\nfour experimental approaches (GCH, GSCH, GECH, FCH). During the initial image\nprocessing stage, Gaussian blurring, sharpening filter, embossing filter, and\nFourier Transform were applied, followed by Canny Edge Detection and Hough\nTransform. Notably, the method was developed to accurately extract the\nreference line by averaging the x-coordinates of the lines detected through the\nHough Transform. This approach enabled the detection of the 0.2 mm thick piano\nwire with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and other interfering\nfactors (e.g., concrete cracks inside the elevator shaft or safety bars for\nfilming equipment). The experimental results showed that Experiment 4 (FCH),\nwhich utilized Fourier Transform in the preprocessing stage, achieved the\nhighest detection rate for the LtoL, LtoR, and RtoL datasets. Experiment\n2(GSCH), which applied Gaussian blurring and a sharpening filter, demonstrated\nsuperior detection performance on the RtoR dataset.

We applied this framework to train\nPhyloGPN, a model that excels at predicting functionally disruptive variants\nfrom a single sequence alone and demonstrates strong transfer learning\ncapabilities.",

The powerful semantic understanding capabilities\nof LLM offer new opportunities to solve this problem. Although existing large\nmodel debugging frameworks excel in semantic tasks, limited by fixed processes\nand lack adaptive and dynamic adjustment capabilities. Inspired by the dual\nprocess theory of decision-making (Fast and Slow Thinking), we present a\nLLM-based framework called RustBrain that automatically and flexibly minimizes\nUBs in Rust projects. Fast thinking extracts features to generate solutions,\nwhile slow thinking decomposes, verifies, and generalizes them abstractly. To\napply verification and generalization results to solution generation, enabling\ndynamic adjustments and precise outputs, RustBrain integrates two thinking\nthrough a feedback mechanism.

    "abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is poorly constrained at the sub-parsec\nscales relevant to turbulent energy dissipation and regulation of multi-phase\nstructure. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sensitive to small-scale plasma density\nfluctuations, which can induce multipath propagation (scattering). The amount\nof scattering depends on the density fluctuation spectrum, including its\namplitude $C_{\\rm n}^2$, spectral index $\\beta$, and dissipation scale $l_{\\rm\ni}$. We use quasar observations of CGM turbulence at $\\gtrsim$ pc scales to\ninfer $C_{\\rm n}^2$, finding it to be $10^{-16}\\lesssim C_{\\rm n}^2\\lesssim\n10^{-9}$ m$^{-20/3}$ for hot ($T>10^6$ K) gas and $10^{-8}\\lesssim C_{\\rm\nn}^2\\lesssim 10^{-4}$ m$^{-20/3}$ for cool ($10^4\\lesssim T\\lesssim 10^5$ K)\ngas, depending on the gas sound speed and density. These values of $C_{\\rm\nn}^2$ are much smaller than those inferred in the interstellar medium at\nsimilar physical scales. The resulting scattering delays from the hot CGM are\nnegligible ($\\ll1$ $\\mu$s at 1 GHz), but are more detectable from the cool gas\nas either radio pulse broadening or scintillation, depending on the observing\nfrequency and sightline geometry. Joint quasar-FRB observations of individual\ngalaxies can yield lower limits on $l_{\\rm i}$, even if the CGM is not a\nsignificant scattering site. An initial comparison between quasar and FRB\nobservations (albeit for different systems) suggests $l_{\\rm i}\\gtrsim750$ km\nin $\\sim10^4$ K gas in order for the quasar and FRB constraints to be\nconsistent. If a foreground CGM is completely ruled out as a source of\nscattering along an FRB sightline then $l_{\\rm i}$ may be comparable to the\nsmallest cloud sizes ($\\lesssim$ pc) inferred from photoionization modeling of\nquasar absorption lines.",

To alleviate\nartifacts, we propose a frequency-domain hard patch selection method that\nidentifies artifact-prone regions by analyzing spectral discrepancies using\nFourier transform and filtering techniques, allowing targeted fine-tuning to\nenhance demosaicing performance. Finally, we propose UniSpecTest, a real-world\nmultispectral mosaic image dataset for testing. Ablation experiments have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of each training step, and extensive experiments\non both synthetic and real datasets show that our method achieves significant\nperformance gains compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "Rapid bone scintigraphy is crucial for diagnosing skeletal disorders and\ndetecting tumor metastases in children, as it shortens scan duration and\nreduces discomfort. However, accelerated acquisition often degrades image\nquality, impairing the visibility of fine anatomical details and potentially\ncompromising diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first\napplication of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration,\nutilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance pediatric rapid bone\nscintigraphy. Our approach employs two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and\n$f^{IR2}$, supported by three specialized modules: a Semantic Prior Integration\n(SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic\nConsistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules inject domain-specific\nsemantic cues from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM preserves coherent semantic\nfeature representations across both cascaded stages. Moreover, we present RBS,\na novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset comprising paired standard (20 cm/min)\nand rapid (40 cm/min) scans from 137 pediatric patients aged 0.5 - 16 years,\nmaking it the first dataset tailored for pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy\nrestoration.

    "abstract": "In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons\nin the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce\nan analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence\nby employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the\nproperties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations\n-- where the divergence rate $\\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent\nmetric functions -- our approach relates $\\bar{a}$ to the components of the\nEinstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By\napplying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \\begin{align*}\n\\bar{a}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-8\\pi\nR_{\\mathrm{m}}^2\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)}}, \\end{align*}\nwhere $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy\ndensity and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed\nby the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\\bar{a}=1$ emerging\nwhen $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\Pi_{\\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the\nlong-standing puzzle of obtaining $\\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes\nsupported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are\nreflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound\nconnection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of\ngravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific\ngravitational theory, offers a universal tool for testing gravitational\ntheories and interpreting astrophysical observations.",

Specifically, we first introduce the notion\nof $k$-partition transformation to achieve any desired partition of the nodes.\nThen, we use this notion to formulate the multi-partite output regulation\nproblem (MORP) of heterogeneous linear MASs, which comprises the existing\ncooperative output regulation problem (CORP) and bipartite output regulation\nproblem (BORP) as subcases. The goal of the MORP is to design a distributed\ncontrol law such that each follower that belongs to the same set in the\npartition asymptotically tracks a scalar multiple of the reference while\nensuring the internal stability of the closed-loop system. It is shown that the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the MORP with a\nfeedforward-based distributed control law follow from the CORP and lead to the\nfirst design strategy for the control parameters. However, it has a drawback in\nterms of scalability due to a partition-dependent condition. We prove that this\ncondition is implied by its partition-independent version under a mild\nstructural condition. This implication yields the second design strategy that\nis much more scalable than the first one.

To address this issue, we\npresent, and open-source, the first sonar-based around-device input on an\nunmodified consumer smartwatch. We achieve this using a fine-grained,\none-dimensional sonar-based finger-tracking system. In addition, we use this\nsystem to investigate the fundamental issue of how to trigger selections during\naround-device smartwatch input through two studies. The first examines the\nmethods of double-crossing, dwell, and finger tap in a binary task, while the\nsecond considers a subset of these designs in a multi-target task and in the\npresence and absence of haptic feedback. Results showed double-crossing was\noptimal for binary tasks, while dwell excelled in multi-target scenarios, and\nhaptic feedback enhanced comfort but not performance. These findings offer\ndesign insights for future around-device smartwatch interfaces that can be\ndirectly deployed on today's consumer hardware.",

This has\nled to intensive research into optimizing their production to increase yields\nand minimize costs, which is challenging because biotechnological methods for\nrhamnolipid production result in complex product mixtures and require the\nintroduction of complex separation strategies to ensure the purity of the\nrhamnolipid obtained. This is an important issue for the introduction of\nrhamnolipids to the market due to the differences that exist between the\nproperties of the different congeners. This review attempts to provide an\noverview of the interfacial properties, potential applications, and recent\nadvances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the adsorption\nto interfaces and assembly in solution of rhamnolipids. In addition, the review\nalso discusses some general aspects related to the production and purification\nmethods of rhamnolipids, highlighting the need for further research to fully\nexploit their potential. It is hoped that this review will contribute to the\ngrowing body of knowledge about rhamnolipids and stimulate further research in\nthis field.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that phase function methods allow for the numerical solution\nof a large class of oscillatory second order linear ordinary differential\nequations in time independent of frequency. Unfortunately, these methods break\ndown in the commonly-occurring case in which the equation has turning points.\nHere, we resolve this difficulty by introducing a generalized phase function\nmethod designed for the case of second order linear ordinary differential\nequations with turning points. More explicitly, we prove the existence of a\nslowly-varying ``Airy phase function'' that efficiently represents a basis in\nthe space of solutions of such an equation, and describe a numerical algorithm\nfor calculating this Airy phase function. The running time of our algorithm is\nindependent of the magnitude of the logarithmic derivatives of the equation's\nsolutions, which is a measure of their rate of variation that generalizes the\nnotion of frequency to functions which are rapidly varying but not necessarily\noscillatory. Once the Airy phase function has been constructed, any reasonable\ninitial or boundary value problem for the equation can be readily solved and,\nunlike step methods which output the values of a rapidly-varying solution on a\nsparse discretization grid that is insufficient for interpolation, the output\nof our scheme allows for the rapid evaluation of the obtained solution at any\npoint in its domain. We rigorously justify our approach by proving not only the\nexistence of slowly-varying Airy phase functions, but also the convergence of\nour numerical method. Moreover, we present the results of extensive numerical\nexperiments demonstrating the efficacy of our algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on\ncurrent goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago,\nusing them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but\nstructurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic\nmemories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the\nprefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement\nlearning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for\ngoal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate\nquery-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic\nmemories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands.\nMoreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when\nfaced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved,\nmanner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively\nretrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar\nenvironments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves\nlearning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization\nto novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3)\nthe PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and\nretrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific\nrepresentations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of\ngoal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for\ndecision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by\nwhich PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.",

In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by\ndesigning three evolution strategies to create variants: mutation,\nparaphrasing, and code-rewriting. By comparing the performance and AST\nsimilarity of the LLM-generated codes before and after these three evolutions,\nwe develop a memorization score that positively correlates with the level of\nmemorization.

Next, we\nrefine the coarse estimates obtained in the first step by modifying the\nSpace-Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm for fine\nparameter estimation. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with shared AOA achieve a better Cramer-Rao lower\nbound (CRLB) than those without sharing. This finding highlights the potential\nof leveraging joint sensing and communication channels to enhance parameter\nestimation accuracy, particularly in channel or location estimation\napplications.",

A prior work has used one-dimensional\nhealth representations, but patient health is inherently multidimensional and\ntypically consists of many measurable physiological factors. In this paper, we\nintroduce a multidimensional health state model within the RPM framework and\nuse dynamic programming to study optimal monitoring strategies. Our analysis\nreveals that the optimal control is characterized by switching curves (for\ntwo-dimensional health states) or switching hyper-surfaces (in general):\npatients switch to intensive monitoring when health measurements cross a\nspecific multidimensional surface. We further study how the optimal switching\ncurve varies for different medical conditions and model parameters. This\nfinding of the optimal control structure provides actionable insights for\nclinicians and aids in resource planning. The tunable modeling framework\nenhances the applicability and effectiveness of RPM services across various\nmedical conditions.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on recovering an underlying matrix from its noisy partial\nentries, a problem commonly known as matrix completion. We delve into the\ninvestigation of a non-convex regularization, referred to as transformed $L_1$\n(TL1), which interpolates between the rank and the nuclear norm of matrices\nthrough a hyper-parameter $a \\in (0, \\infty)$. While some literature adopts\nsuch regularization for matrix completion, it primarily addresses scenarios\nwith uniformly missing entries and focuses on algorithmic advances. To fill in\nthe gap in the current literature, we provide a comprehensive statistical\nanalysis for the estimator from a TL1-regularized recovery model under general\nsampling distribution. In particular, we show that when $a$ is sufficiently\nlarge, the matrix recovered by the TL1-based model enjoys a convergence rate\nmeasured by the Frobenius norm, comparable to that of the model based on the\nnuclear norm, despite the challenges posed by the non-convexity of the TL1\nregularization. When $a$ is small enough, we show that the rank of the\nestimated matrix remains a constant order when the true matrix is exactly\nlow-rank. A trade-off between controlling the error and the rank is established\nthrough different choices of tuning parameters. The appealing practical\nperformance of TL1 regularization is demonstrated through a simulation study\nthat encompasses various sampling mechanisms, as well as two real-world\napplications. Additionally, the role of the hyper-parameter $a$ on the\nTL1-based model is explored via experiments to offer guidance in practical\nscenarios.",

We\nconsider the pull model where the sensor samples DTMC state whenever the\nmonitor requests a status update.

Our numerical results show\ninteresting trade-offs between AoD, sampling frequency, and transmission\nsuccess probability.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has evolved into a widely investigated technology\nfor the development of smart TSC strategies. However, current RL algorithms\nnecessitate excessive interaction with the environment to learn effective\npolicies, making them impractical for large-scale tasks. The DreamerV3\nalgorithm presents compelling properties for policy learning. It summarizes\ngeneral dynamics knowledge about the environment and enables the prediction of\nfuture outcomes of potential actions from past experience, reducing the\ninteraction with the environment through imagination training. In this paper, a\ncorridor TSC model is trained using the DreamerV3 algorithm to explore the\nbenefits of world models for TSC strategy learning. In RL environment design,\nto manage congestion levels effectively, both the state and reward functions\nare defined based on queue length, and the action is designed to manage queue\nlength efficiently. Using the SUMO simulation platform, the two hyperparameters\n(training ratio and model size) of the DreamerV3 algorithm were tuned and\nanalyzed across different OD matrix scenarios. We discovered that choosing a\nsmaller model size and initially attempting several medium training ratios can\nsignificantly reduce the time spent on hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we\nfound that the approach is generally applicable as it can solve two TSC task\nscenarios with the same hyperparameters. Regarding the claimed data-efficiency\nof the DreamerV3 algorithm, due to the significant fluctuation of the episode\nreward curve in the early stages of training, it can only be confirmed that\nlarger model sizes exhibit modest data-efficiency, and no evidence was found\nthat increasing the training ratio accelerates convergence.",

We\nconstruct a quantum phase diagram in the plane of the next-nearest-neighbor\nhopping parameter $t_2$ and onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, revealing five\ndistinct quantum phases. At low $U$ and moderate to high magnitude of $t_2$,\nthe system exhibits metallic behavior, while at large $U$ and small magnitude\nof $t_2$, it transitions to a ferrimagnetic insulator phase, similar to those\nobserved in certain trimer materials. In the small $t_2$ limit, the Fermi\nenergy is in the flat band, leading to localization of the electrons within the\ntrimer. At low $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, the flat band mechanism favors\ninsulating ferrimagnetism, whereas at large $U$, ferrimagnetic states emerge\nfrom singlet dimer formation between neighboring sites of a trimer and an\nisolated corner spin, which connect ferromagnetically.

Active LfD aims to improve this by letting robots\nactively request demonstrations to enhance learning. However, this may lead to\nfrequent context switches between various task situations, increasing the human\ncognitive load and introducing errors to demonstrations. Moreover, few prior\nstudies in active LfD have examined how these active query strategies may\nimpact human teaching in aspects beyond user experience, which can be crucial\nfor developing algorithms that benefit both robot learning and human teaching.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose an active LfD method that optimizes the\nquery sequence of online human demonstrations via Curriculum Learning (CL),\nwhere demonstrators are guided to provide demonstrations in situations of\ngradually increasing difficulty. We evaluate our method across four simulated\nrobotic tasks with sparse rewards and conduct a user study (N=26) to\ninvestigate the influence of active LfD methods on human teaching regarding\nteaching performance, post-guidance teaching adaptivity, and teaching\ntransferability. Our results show that our method significantly improves\nlearning performance compared to three other LfD baselines in terms of the\nfinal success rate of the converged policy and sample efficiency. Additionally,\nresults from our user study indicate that our method significantly reduces the\ntime required from human demonstrators and decreases failed demonstration\nattempts.

While complex photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are widely employed\nto harness the full degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light for efficient data\ntransmission, their waveguide nature inherently constrains two-dimensional\nspatial scaling to accommodate a large number of optical signals in parallel.\nHere, we present a novel optical receiver platform that fully exploits the high\nspatial parallelism and ultrabroad bandwidth of light, while leveraging all\nDOFs - intensity, phase, and polarization. Our solution integrates a thin\nmetasurface, composed of silicon nanoposts, with ultrafast membrane\nphotodetectors on a compact chip. The metasurface provides all the\nfunctionalities of conventional PICs for normal-incident spatially parallelized\nlight, enabling high-speed detection of optical signals in various modulation\nformats, including simultaneous detection of 320-gigabits-per-second\nfour-channel signals and coherent detection of a 240-gigabits-per-second\nsignal.",

A semiflow $F$ can have many global trapping regions but, if it\nhas a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition\nand we say that $F$ has compact dynamics if it has a global attractor $G$. We\nshow that most of the qualitative properties of $F$ are inherited by the\nrestriction $F_G$ of $F$ to $G$ and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of\n$F$, the qualitative behavior of $F$ and $F_G$ coincide. Moreover, if $F$ is a\ncontinuous-time semiflow, then its graph is identical to the graph of its\ntime-1 map.

However, due to inherent issues\nin imaging principles, it faces significant challenges including spatially\nvarying noise and anisotropic resolution, where the axial resolution lags\nbehind the lateral resolution up to 4.5 times. Meanwhile, laser power is kept\nlow to maintain cell viability, leading to inaccessible low-noise and\nhigh-resolution paired ground truth (GT). To tackle these limitations, a dual\nCycle-consistent Diffusion is proposed to effectively mine intra-volume imaging\npriors within 3D cell volumes in an unsupervised manner, i.e., Volume Tells\n(VTCD), achieving de-noising and super-resolution (SR) simultaneously.\nSpecifically, a spatially iso-distributed denoiser is designed to exploit the\nnoise distribution consistency between adjacent low-noise and high-noise\nregions within the 3D cell volume, suppressing the spatially varying noise.\nThen, in light of the structural consistency of the cell volume, a cross-plane\nglobal-propagation SR module propagates high-resolution details from the XY\nplane into adjacent regions in the XZ and YZ planes, progressively enhancing\nresolution across the entire 3D cell volume. Experimental results on 10 in vivo\ncellular dataset demonstrate high improvements in both denoising and\nsuper-resolution, with axial resolution enhanced from ~ 430 nm to ~ 90 nm.",

    "abstract": "The first word in the title is intended in a sense suggested by Lawvere and\nSchanuel whereby finite sets are objective natural numbers. At the objective\nlevel, the axioms defining abstract Mackey and Tambara functors are\ncategorically familiar. The first step was taken by Harald Lindner in 1976 when\nhe recognized that Mackey functors, defined as pairs of functors, were single\nfunctors with domain a category of spans. We define objective Mackey and\nobjective Tambara functors as parametrized categories which have local finite\nproducts and satisfy some parametrized completeness and cocompleteness\nrestriction. However, we can replace the original parametrizing base for\nobjective Mackey functors by a bicategory of spans while the replacement for\nobjective Tambara functors is a bicategory obtained by iterating the span\nconstruction; these iterated spans are polynomials. There is an objective\nMackey functor of ordinary Mackey functors. We show that there is a\ndistributive law relating objective Mackey functors to objective Tambara\nfunctors analogous to the distributive law relating abelian groups to\ncommutative rings. We remark on hom enrichment matters involving the 2-category\n$\\mathrm{Cat}_{+}$ of categories admitting finite coproducts and functors\npreserving them, both as a closed base and as a skew-closed base.",

We explore a novel multi-robot CL approach that enables\nknowledge transfer from black-box VPR models (teachers), such as those of local\nrobots encountered by traveler robots (students) in unknown environments.\nSpecifically, we introduce Membership Inference Attack, or MIA, the only major\nprivacy attack applicable to black-box models, and leverage it to reconstruct\npseudo training sets, which serve as the key knowledge to be exchanged between\nrobots, from black-box VPR models. Furthermore, we aim to overcome the\ninherently low sampling efficiency of MIA by leveraging insights on place class\nprediction distribution and un-learned class detection imported from the VPR\nliterature as a prior distribution. We also analyze both the individual effects\nof these methods and their combined impact. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our black-box MIA (BB-MIA) approach is remarkably powerful despite its\nsimplicity, significantly enhancing the VPR capability of lower-performing\nrobots through brief communication with other robots.

Unlike conventional\nbenchmarks, Recipe2Plan challenges agents to optimize cooking time through\nparallel task execution while respecting temporal constraints i.e. specific\nactions need to be performed within a particular time intervals following the\npreceding steps. Overly aggressive local parallelization may disrupt this\nconstraint, potentially compromising the entire cooking process. This strict\ntime constraint between actions raises a unique challenge for agents to balance\nbetween maximizing concurrent operations and adhering to critical timing\nconstraints. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal\nchallenges in maintaining this balance between efficiency and feasibility. The\nresults highlight the need for improved temporal awareness and global\nmultitasking capabilities in large language models.

The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more\ngeneral evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition.

In particular, the learning error within the\nidentifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case,\neven without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new\nperspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the\nchallenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited.\nTo improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol\nis proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under\ncomplementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to\noperate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with\nneighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of\nestimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using\ncooperative local estimators.

Recent approaches achieve\nimpressive successes by combining ideas from both consistency regularization\nand pseudo-labeling. However, these methods tend to underperform in the more\nrealistic situations with relatively scarce labeled data. We argue that this\nissue arises because existing methods rely solely on the model's confidence,\nmaking them challenging to accurately assess the model's state and identify\nunlabeled examples contributing to the training phase when supervision\ninformation is limited, especially during the early stages of model training.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel SSL model called CGMatch, which, for the\nfirst time, incorporates a new metric known as Count-Gap (CG). We demonstrate\nthat CG is effective in discovering unlabeled examples beneficial for model\ntraining. Along with confidence, a commonly used metric in SSL, we propose a\nfine-grained dynamic selection (FDS) strategy. This strategy dynamically\ndivides the unlabeled dataset into three subsets with different\ncharacteristics: easy-to-learn set, ambiguous set, and hard-to-learn set. By\nselective filtering subsets, and applying corresponding regularization with\nselected subsets, we mitigate the negative impact of incorrect pseudo-labels on\nmodel optimization and generalization. Extensive experimental results on\nseveral common SSL benchmarks indicate the effectiveness of CGMatch especially\nwhen the labeled data are particularly limited.

    "abstract": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a powerful method for\nimproving generalization in machine learning models by minimizing the sharpness\nof the loss landscape. However, despite its success, several important\nquestions regarding the convergence properties of SAM in non-convex settings\nare still open, including the benefits of using normalization in the update\nrule, the dependence of the analysis on the restrictive bounded variance\nassumption, and the convergence guarantees under different sampling strategies.\nTo address these questions, in this paper, we provide a unified analysis of SAM\nand its unnormalized variant (USAM) under one single flexible update rule\n(Unified SAM), and we present convergence results of the new algorithm under a\nrelaxed and more natural assumption on the stochastic noise. Our analysis\nprovides convergence guarantees for SAM under different step size selections\nfor non-convex problems and functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL)\ncondition (a non-convex generalization of strongly convex functions). The\nproposed theory holds under the arbitrary sampling paradigm, which includes\nimportance sampling as special case, allowing us to analyze variants of SAM\nthat were never explicitly considered in the literature. Experiments validate\nthe theoretical findings and further demonstrate the practical effectiveness of\nUnified SAM in training deep neural networks for image classification tasks.",

First, for any fixed $l\\geq 1$ and $q\\geq 2$, we show that there exists a\nconstant $c$ such that $(\\left\\lfloor{n/2}\\right\\rfloor-l)$-uniform states in\n$(\\mathbb{C}^q)^{\\otimes n}$ do not exist when $n\\geq cq^2+o(q^2)$. The\nconstant $c$ equals $4$ when $l=1$ and $6$ when $l=2$, which generalizes\nScott's bound (2004) for $l=0$.\n  2. Second, when $n$ is sufficiently large, we show that there exists a\nconstant $\\theta<1/2$ for each $q \\le 9$, such that $k$-uniform states in\n$(\\mathbb{C}^q)^{\\otimes n}$ exist only when $k\\leq \\theta n$.

While previous efforts mainly focus on a single\nmodality, test-time distribution shift in the multi-modal setting is more\ncomplex and calls for new solutions. This paper tackles the problem of\nmulti-modal test-time adaptation by proposing a novel method named Attention\nBootstrapping with Principal Entropy Minimization (ABPEM). We observe that\ntest-time distribution shift causes misalignment across modalities, leading to\na large gap between intra-modality discrepancies (measured by self-attention)\nand inter-modality discrepancies (measured by cross-attention). We name this\nthe attention gap. This attention gap widens with more severe distribution\nshifts, hindering effective modality fusion. To mitigate this attention gap and\nencourage better modality fusion, we propose attention bootstrapping that\npromotes cross-attention with the guidance of self-attention. Moreover, to\nreduce the gradient noise in the commonly-used entropy minimization, we adopt\nprincipal entropy minimization, a refinement of entropy minimization that\nreduces gradient noise by focusing on the principal parts of entropy, excluding\nless reliable gradient information. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed ABPEM in comparison with competing\nbaselines.",

The multi-attempt task encourages the model to refine its previous\nattempts and improve search efficiency.

In contrast, the same LLM\ntrained on a standard single-turn task exhibits only a marginal improvement,\nincreasing from 42.3% to 43.2% when given more attempts during evaluation. The\nresults indicate that, compared to the standard single-turn task, an LLM\ntrained on a multi-attempt task achieves slightly better performance on math\nbenchmarks while also learning to refine its responses more effectively based\non user feedback.

The hybrid architecture combining CNNs\nand Transformers shows great promise for enhancing multi-frame IRSTD\nperformance. In this paper, we propose LVNet, a simple yet powerful hybrid\narchitecture that redefines low-level feature learning in hybrid frameworks for\nmulti-frame IRSTD. Our key insight is that the standard linear patch embeddings\nin Vision Transformers are insufficient for capturing the scale-sensitive local\nfeatures critical to infrared small targets. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce a multi-scale CNN frontend that explicitly models local features by\nleveraging the local spatial bias of convolution. Additionally, we design a\nU-shaped video Transformer for multi-frame spatiotemporal context modeling,\neffectively capturing the motion characteristics of targets. Experiments on the\npublicly available datasets IRDST and NUDT-MIRSDT demonstrate that LVNet\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared to the current\nbest-performing method, LMAFormer, LVNet achieves an improvement of 5.63\\% /\n18.36\\% in nIoU, while using only 1/221 of the parameters and 1/92 / 1/21 of\nthe computational cost.

The framework\nwas validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated\ndeformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame\nsegmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively\nhandled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed\nmean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +-\n0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models.

    "abstract": "Critical ground states of quantum many-body systems have emerged as vital\nresources for quantum-enhanced sensing. Traditional methods to prepare these\nstates often rely on adiabatic evolution, which may diminish the quantum\nsensing advantage. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning\n(QRL)-enhanced critical sensing protocol for quantum many-body systems with\nexotic phase diagrams. Starting from product states and utilizing\nQRL-discovered gate sequences, we explore sensing accuracy in the presence of\nunknown external magnetic fields, covering both local and global regimes. Our\nresults demonstrate that QRL-learned sequences reach the finite quantum speed\nlimit and generalize effectively across systems of arbitrary size, ensuring\naccuracy regardless of preparation time. This method can robustly achieve\nHeisenberg and super-Heisenberg limits, even in noisy environments with\npractical Pauli measurements. Our study highlights the efficacy of QRL in\nenabling precise quantum state preparation, thereby advancing scalable,\nhigh-accuracy quantum critical sensing.",

A\nstraightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures\nthrough structure-aligned coordinate systems, or\"frames.\" However, unlike\nmolecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to\ntheir infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods\nrely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its\nstructural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we\nrethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with\nthe structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While\naccommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames\nprovide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on\nactively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the\nattention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in\na new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that\nCrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in\nvarious crystal property prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium\n(ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions\nthe gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D\nabundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction\ncaused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the\nD atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb\nSpace Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of\ndeuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C--D emission at\n4.65${\\,{\\rm \\mu m}}$ and possibly aromatic C--D emission at 4.4${\\,{\\rm \\mu\nm}}$ as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir,\nwe model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing\nvarious aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small\ndeuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65${\\,{\\rm \\mu\nm}}$ even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive\n${{N_{\\rm D,ali}}}/{N_{\\rm H}}\\approx3.4\\%$, the deuteration degree of PAHs\nmeasured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed\nintensity ratios of the 4.65${\\,{\\rm \\mu m}}$ band to the 3.3${\\,{\\rm \\mu m}}$\naromatic C--H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is\nless certain as C--N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around\n4.4${\\,{\\rm \\mu m}}$. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C--D, we\nderive an upper limit of $\\approx14\\%$ on the deuteration degree, which is\ncapable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.",

    "abstract": "This theoretical work examines 'hallucinations' in both human cognition and\nlarge language models, comparing how each system can produce perceptions or\noutputs that deviate from reality. Drawing on neuroscience and machine learning\nresearch, we highlight the predictive processes that underlie human and\nartificial thought. In humans, complex neural mechanisms interpret sensory\ninformation under uncertainty, sometimes filling in gaps and creating false\nperceptions. This inference occurs hierarchically: higher cortical levels send\ntop-down predictions to lower-level regions, while mismatches (prediction\nerrors) propagate upward to refine the model. LLMs, in contrast, rely on\nauto-regressive modeling of text and can generate erroneous statements in the\nabsence of robust grounding. Despite these different foundations - biological\nversus computational - the similarities in their predictive architectures help\nexplain why hallucinations occur. We propose that the propensity to generate\nincorrect or confabulated responses may be an inherent feature of advanced\nintelligence. In both humans and AI, adaptive predictive processes aim to make\nsense of incomplete information and anticipate future states, fostering\ncreativity and flexibility, but also introducing the risk of errors. Our\nanalysis illuminates how factors such as feedback, grounding, and error\ncorrection affect the likelihood of 'being wrong' in each system. We suggest\nthat mitigating AI hallucinations (e.g., through improved training,\npost-processing, or knowledge-grounding methods) may also shed light on human\ncognitive processes, revealing how error-prone predictions can be harnessed for\ninnovation without compromising reliability. By exploring these converging and\ndivergent mechanisms, the paper underscores the broader implications for\nadvancing both AI reliability and scientific understanding of human thought.",

By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and\nevaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \\emph{``blind faith\nin text''} phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual\ndata when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under\ncorrupted text and raising safety concerns.

To address this, we construct a photorealistic\nsimulation environment of quadrotor racing tracks, called FalconGym, which\nprovides effectively unlimited synthetic images for training. Within FalconGym,\nwe develop a pipelined approach for crossing gates that combines (i) a Neural\nPose Estimator (NPE) coupled with a Kalman filter to reliably infer quadrotor\nposes from single-frame RGB images and IMU data, and (ii) a\nself-attention-based multi-modal controller that adaptively integrates visual\nfeatures and pose estimation.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization\ncapabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches\ntypically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However,\nbehavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken\ngeneralization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical\nsteps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and\nstrategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning\nthese steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and\nefficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in\nexpert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced\ncosts. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method\nmitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes\ngeneralization across different environments and tasks. In extensive\nexperiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS\noutperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents.\nATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting\nwith diverse environments.",

    "abstract": "A set with a group action is referred to as a $G$-set, and the set of\nfunctions that commute with this action forms a monoid under function\ncomposition. This paper examines the case where the $G$-set is finite, which\nimplies that the monoid of $G$-equivariant functions is also finite. The\ndocument provides formulas for calculating the cardinality of this monoid, its\ngroup of units, and explores special cases of $G$-equivariant functions, known\nas fixing elementary collapsings. All of these results are expressed in terms\nof specific properties of the $G$-set, including the number of orbits and\ncertain indices of the subgroups acting as stabilizers.",

In such\nsettings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints\ndefined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in\ncompetitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic\nvariables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining\nlearnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model\n(LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of\nimpression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction\nenvironment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding\nauto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is\nfine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics\nwhile satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both\nreal-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant\nimprovements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as\nwell as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.",

Existing approaches typically model unordered matches as\na consistency graph and sample consistent matches to generate hypotheses.\nHowever, explicit graph construction introduces noise, posing great challenges\nfor handcrafted geometric constraints to render consistency.

To our\nknowledge, HyperGCT is the first method that mines robust geometric constraints\nfrom dynamic hypergraphs for 3D registration.

Current approaches for nucleus\ndetection in gigapixel WSIs utilize a sliding window methodology, which\noverlooks boarder contextual information (eg, tissue structure) and easily\nleads to inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, recent studies\nadditionally crops a large Filed-of-View (FoV) region around each sliding\nwindow to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially\nincreases the inference latency. In this paper, we propose an effective and\nefficient context-aware nucleus detection algorithm. Specifically, instead of\nleveraging large FoV regions, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf\nfeatures of historically visited sliding windows. This design greatly reduces\ncomputational overhead. Moreover, compared to large FoV regions at a low\nmagnification, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide\nfiner-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy. To\nfurther improve the efficiency, we propose a grid pooling technique to compress\ndense feature maps of each patch into a few contextual tokens. Finally, we\ncraft OCELOT-seg, the first benchmark dedicated to context-aware nucleus\ninstance segmentation.

Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation\nof up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The\nformulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection\ncorridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the\nsize of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal\nphases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is\ncompared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC),\nmodeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The\ntrained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements.\nCompared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the\nprimary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets\nmovements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume\nsensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good\nstability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.",

Current methods rely on pre-built maps and\nassume static environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world\nsettings. There is a critical gap in re-finding targets under topographic\n(e.g., walls, corners) and dynamic (e.g., moving pedestrians) occlusions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel heuristic-guided search framework that\ndynamically builds environmental maps while following the target and explicitly\naddresses these two types of occlusions through distinct mechanisms. For\ntopographic occlusions, a belief-guided search field estimates the likelihood\nof the target's presence and guides search toward promising frontiers. For\ndynamic occlusions, an observation-based search strategy adaptively switches\nbetween a fluid-following field and an overtaking potential field based on\noccluder motion patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method\noutperforms existing approaches in terms of search efficiency and success\nrates, both in simulations and real-world tests.

These strongly lensed signals exhibit\nidentical waveform morphology in the frequency domain, allowing analysis\nwithout the need for complex lens models. However, stellar fields and dark\nmatter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects\nthat alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying these microlensing\nsignatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. In this\nstudy, we propose a residual test to efficiently search for microlensing\nsignatures by leveraging the fact that current Bayesian inference pipelines are\noptimized solely for the strong lensing hypothesis. Using cross-correlation\ntechniques, we investigate the microlensing-induced deviations from the strong\nhypothesis, which are imprinted in the residuals.

By comparing interacting and merging galaxies with isolated\ncounterparts, we identify characteristic trends in how interactions influence\nmetallicity gradients over time.

These changes can result in gradients that are either\nflatter or steeper than the initial profiles. Notably, we observe steeper\nmetallicity gradients in interacting galaxies at certain merger stages, which\nis inconsistent with predictions from some galaxy simulations.

This study employs a multi-method approach to\nassess political bias in leading AI systems, integrating four complementary\nmethodologies: (1) linguistic comparison of AI-generated text with the language\nused by Republican and Democratic U.S. Congress members, (2) analysis of\npolitical viewpoints embedded in AI-generated policy recommendations, (3)\nsentiment analysis of AI-generated text toward politically affiliated public\nfigures, and (4) standardized political orientation testing.

However, this bias is not an inherent feature of\nLLMs; prior research demonstrates that fine-tuning with politically skewed data\ncan realign these models across the ideological spectrum. The presence of\nsystematic political bias in AI systems poses risks, including reduced\nviewpoint diversity, increased societal polarization, and the potential for\npublic mistrust in AI technologies.

    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have emerged as powerful models capable of\nunderstanding various data modalities, including text, images, and videos. LMMs\nencode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and\nprocessed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens\nsubstantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The\nincreased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of\ninference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token\npruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The\nexisting token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and\nfine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased\nredundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token\npruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a\nsubset such that the diversity among the selected {tokens} is maximized. Then,\nwe solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The\nproposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest\ndiversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected\ntokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance\neven at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally, DivPrune\nreduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models.\nThe code is available $\\href{https://github.com/vbdi/divprune}{\\text{here}}$.",

    "abstract": "We proceed to the canonical quantization of the complex scalar field without\nmaking use of its real and imaginary parts. Our motivation is to formally\nconnect, as tightly as possible, the quantum-field notions of particle and\nantiparticle - most prominently represented, formally, by creation and\nannihilation operators - to the initial classical field theory - whose main\nformal object is the field amplitude at a given spacetime point. Our point of\nview is that doing this via the use of the real and imaginary parts of the\nfield is not satisfying. The derivation demands to consider, just before\nquantization, the field and its complex conjugate as independent fields, which\nyields a system of two copies of independent complex scalar fields. One then\nproceeds to quantization with these two copies, which leads to the introduction\nof two families of creation and annihilation operators, corresponding to\nparticles on the one hand, and antiparticles on the other hand. One realizes\nthat having two such families is the only hope for being able to \"invert\" the\ndefinitions of the creation and annihilation in terms of the Fourier quantized\nfields, so as to obtain an expression of the direct-space fields in terms of\nthese creation and annihilation operators, because the real-field condition\nused in the case of a real scalar field does not hold for a complex scalar\nfield. This hope is then met by introducing the complex-conjugate constraint at\nthe quantum level, that is, that the second independent field copy is actually\nthe complex conjugate of the first. All standard results are then recovered in\na rigorous and purely deductive way. While we reckon our derivation exists in\nthe literature, we have not found it.",

In this paper, we explore\nthe strength of SADD-based methods by theoretically showing that minimizing\ndistributional discrepancy can help reduce the expected loss on AEs. Despite\nthese advantages, SADD-based methods have a potential limitation: they discard\ninputs that are detected as AEs, leading to the loss of useful information\nwithin those inputs. To address this limitation, we propose a two-pronged\nadversarial defense method, named Distributional-discrepancy-based Adversarial\nDefense (DAD). In the training phase, DAD first optimizes the test power of the\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to derive MMD-OPT, which is a stone that kills\ntwo birds. MMD-OPT first serves as a guiding signal to minimize the\ndistributional discrepancy between CEs and AEs to train a denoiser. Then, it\nserves as a discriminator to differentiate CEs and AEs during inference.\nOverall, in the inference stage, DAD consists of a two-pronged process: (1)\ndirectly feeding the detected CEs into the classifier, and (2) removing noise\nfrom the detected AEs by the distributional-discrepancy-based denoiser.\nExtensive experiments show that DAD outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ndefense methods by simultaneously improving clean and robust accuracy on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K against adaptive white-box attacks.

    "abstract": "This work is motivated by the study of continued fraction expansions of real\nnumbers: we describe in dynamical terms their orbits under the action of\n$\\mathrm{PGL}_2(\\mathbb{Q})$. A real number gives rise to a Sturmian system\nencoding a rotation of the circle. It is well known that\n$\\mathrm{PGL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence of real numbers, characterized by the\ntails of their continued fraction expansions, amounts to flow equivalence of\nSturmian systems. We show that the multiplicative action of $m\\in \\mathbb{Z}$\non a real number corresponds to taking the $m$th-power followed by what we call\nan infinitesimal 2-asymptotic factor of its Sturmian system.\n  This leads us to introduce the notion of isogeny between zero-dimensional\nsystems: it combines virtual flow equivalences and infinitesimal asymptotic\nequivalences. We develop tools for classifying systems up to isogeny involving\ncohomological invariants and states. We then use this to give a complete\ndescription of $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{Q})$-equivalence of real numbers in\nterms of Sturmian systems. We classify Denjoy systems up to isogenies within\nthis class via the action of $\\mathrm{PGL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Q})$ on their\ninvariants.\n  We also investigate eventual flow equivalence of Sturmian systems: we show\nthat for non-quadratic parameters it amounts to topological conjugacy and for\nquadratic parameters it implies total flow equivalence and other arithmetic\nconstraints.\n  In another direction, we consider interval exchanges satisfying Keane's\ncondition. We characterize flow equivalence in terms of interval-induced\nsubsystems (or the tails of their paths in the bilateral Rauzy induction\ndiagram). Finally we find rational invariants for isogeny involving the length\nmodules and SAF invariants of the associated ergodic measures. This leads to a\nconjecture for their classification up to isogeny, which we prove in the\ntotally ergodic case.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is a key imaging modality for diagnosis, yet its\nclinical utility is marred by high radiation exposure and long turnaround\ntimes, restricting its use for larger-scale screening. Although chest\nradiography (CXR) is more accessible and safer, existing CXR foundation models\nfocus primarily on detecting diseases that are readily visible on the CXR.\nRecently, works have explored training disease classification models on\nsimulated CXRs, but they remain limited to recognizing a single disease type\nfrom CT. CT foundation models have also emerged with significantly improved\ndetection of pathologies in CT. However, the generalized application of\nCT-derived labels on CXR has remained illusive. In this study, we propose\nX2CT-CLIP, a tri-modal knowledge transfer learning framework that bridges the\nmodality gap between CT and CXR while reducing the computational burden of\nmodel training. Our approach is the first work to enable multi-abnormality\nclassification in CT, using CXR, by transferring knowledge from 3D CT volumes\nand associated radiology reports to a CXR encoder via a carefully designed\ntri-modal alignment mechanism in latent space. Extensive evaluations on three\nmulti-label CT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in cross-modal retrieval, few-shot adaptation, and\nexternal validation. These results highlight the potential of CXR, enriched\nwith knowledge derived from CT, as a viable efficient alternative for disease\ndetection in resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic tabular data are increasingly being used to replace real data,\nserving as an effective solution that simultaneously protects privacy and\naddresses data scarcity. However, in addition to preserving global statistical\nproperties, synthetic datasets must also maintain domain-specific logical\nconsistency**-**especially in complex systems like supply chains, where fields\nsuch as shipment dates, locations, and product categories must remain logically\nconsistent for real-world usability. Existing generative models often overlook\nthese inter-column relationships, leading to unreliable synthetic tabular data\nin real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose\nLLM-TabLogic, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Model reasoning to\ncapture and compress the complex logical relationships among tabular columns,\nwhile these conditional constraints are passed into a Score-based Diffusion\nmodel for data generation in latent space. Through extensive experiments on\nreal-world industrial datasets, we evaluate LLM-TabLogic for column reasoning\nand data generation, comparing it with five baselines including SMOTE and\nstate-of-the-art generative models. Our results show that LLM-TabLogic\ndemonstrates strong generalization in logical inference, achieving over 90%\naccuracy on unseen tables. Furthermore, our method outperforms all baselines in\ndata generation by fully preserving inter-column relationships while\nmaintaining the best balance between data fidelity, utility, and privacy.

This\npaper proposes a tilt-rotor tailsitter aircraft with both elevons and tilting\nrotors as a promising solution. By implementing a cascaded weighted least\nsquares (WLS) based incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) controller,\nthe drone successfully achieved autonomous waypoint tracking in outdoor\nexperiments at a cruise airspeed of 16 m/s, including transitions between\nforward flight and hover without actuator saturation.

This\nwork presents the design of a novel pneumatically controlled switch, called\nAeroSwitch, which serves as an RF switch alternative to PIN diodes by\nsignificantly reducing lossy elements and additional biasing circuitry, with a\nfocus on the applicability of AeroSwitch for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nRF switch implantation. AeroSwitch was assessed against the PIN diode using\nbench testing, revealing a slightly reduced average insertion loss of 0.1 dB\nand an enhancement in average isolation by 15 dB. The switches are incorporated\ninto a capacitor switch array within an L-matching network. This matching\nnetwork connects to a loop RF coil, serving as a high-impedance load. The\nquality (Q)-factors were evaluated compared to a PIN diode capacitor switch\narray matching network configured identically. Overall, the AeroSwitch\ndemonstrated an average 62% improved Q-factor compared to the PIN diode. These\nfindings indicate that AeroSwitch offers significant advantages over the PIN\ndiode due to its lower loss and higher isolation, potentially improving SNR.\nAdditionally, the temperature of the AeroSwitch, while operating at 100 watts,\nremained consistently below 30{\\deg}C, suggesting its potential as a\nself-temperature-regulated high-power switch. Since the AeroSwitch is\nnon-magnetic, has high-power capability, low insertion loss, requires no\nelectric biasing, and uses no conductive wires, this switching technique is\nsignificantly beneficial for MRI applications and medical related other RF\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Gradient-based optimization drives the unprecedented performance of modern\ndeep neural network models across diverse applications. Adaptive algorithms\nhave accelerated neural network training due to their rapid convergence rates;\nhowever, they struggle to find ``flat minima\" reliably, resulting in suboptimal\ngeneralization compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By revisiting\nvarious adaptive algorithms' mechanisms, we propose the Frankenstein optimizer,\nwhich combines their advantages. The proposed Frankenstein dynamically adjusts\nfirst- and second-momentum coefficients according to the optimizer's current\nstate to directly maintain consistent learning dynamics and immediately reflect\nsudden gradient changes. Extensive experiments across several research domains\nsuch as computer vision, natural language processing, few-shot learning, and\nscientific simulations show that Frankenstein surpasses existing adaptive\nalgorithms and SGD empirically regarding convergence speed and generalization\nperformance. Furthermore, this research deepens our understanding of adaptive\nalgorithms through centered kernel alignment analysis and loss landscape\nvisualization during the learning process.

    "abstract": "Reliance on stereotypes is a persistent feature of human decision-making and\nhas been extensively documented in educational settings, where it can shape\nstudents' confidence, performance, and long-term human capital accumulation.\nWhile effective techniques exist to mitigate these negative effects, a crucial\nfirst step is to establish whether teachers can recognize stereotypes in their\nprofessional environment. We introduce the Stereotype Identification Test\n(SIT), a novel survey tool that asks teachers to evaluate and comment on the\npresence of stereotypes in images randomly drawn from school textbooks. Their\nresponses are systematically linked to established measures of implicit bias\n(Implicit Association Test, IAT) and explicit bias (survey scales on teaching\nstereotypes and social values). Our findings demonstrate that the SIT is a\nvalid and reliable measure of stereotype recognition. Teachers' ability to\nrecognize stereotypes is linked to trainable traits such as implicit bias\nawareness and inclusive teaching practices. Moreover, providing personalized\nfeedback on implicit bias improves SIT scores by 0.25 standard deviations,\nreinforcing the idea that stereotype recognition is malleable and can be\nenhanced through targeted interventions.",

The learned latent\nrepresentations in world models lack direct mapping to meaningful physical\nquantities and dynamics, limiting their utility and interpretability in\ndownstream planning, control, and safety verification. In this paper, we argue\nfor a fundamental shift from physically informed to physically interpretable\nworld models - and crystallize four principles that leverage symbolic knowledge\nto achieve these ends: (1) functionally organizing the latent space according\nto the physical intent, (2) learning aligned invariant and equivariant\nrepresentations of the physical world, (3) integrating multiple forms and\nstrengths of supervision into a unified training process, and (4) partitioning\ngenerative outputs to support scalability and verifiability. We experimentally\ndemonstrate the value of each principle on two benchmarks. This paper opens\nseveral intriguing research directions to achieve and capitalize on full\nphysical interpretability in world models.",
