    "abstract": "Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated\nlearning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the\nclients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round\ncommunication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of\nclipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee\nclient-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the\nprivacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for\nmoderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the\noriginal GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM\nto FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish\ntheoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a\nlogarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results\nconfirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive\nwith non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.\nMoreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical\nperformance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.",

The\ndiscrepancy distribution between the physical parameters determined by our\nmodel and true values for the synthetic light curves shows very good agreement.\nIn addition, the physical parameters determined by our model and the\ncorresponding light curve fits show remarkable consistency with\n\\cite{2024ApJ...976..223W}'s results.

Unlike\nprevious approaches, which are typically biased toward bright, strongly lensed\nsubmillimeter galaxies (SMGs), our method uncovers fainter systems with lower\nmagnifications. This enables the identification and individual study of lensing\nevents that would otherwise only be accessible through statistical weak lensing\nanalyses. Our approach focuses on high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS in the range\n$1.2 < z < 4.0$, and searches for associated AllWISE sources within an angular\ndistance of 18 arcsec. Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors\n($0.5 < \\mathrm{W2} - \\mathrm{W3} < 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of\nelliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\\mathrm{W1}$ color and\nphotometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination. This conservative\nselection yields 68 new lens candidates. We then performed SED fitting with\nCIGALE across UV to submillimeter wavelengths to estimate the physical\nproperties of both the lenses and the background SMGs, and to assess the\nlensing nature of these candidates. Despite the uncertainties, we were able to\nconstrain key parameters such as stellar and dust masses, infrared\nluminosities, and star formation rates. In addition, the estimated\nmagnifications for most candidates are modest, consistent with the weak lensing\nregime ($\\mu \\simeq 1{-}1.5$), although a few sources may require more precise\nmodeling. Future efforts could refine this methodology to recover potential\ncandidates outside our selection, and high-resolution follow-up observations\nwill be essential to confirm the lensing nature of these sources and to further\ninvestigate their physical properties.",

In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal\nstructures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of\ninduction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and\nlearn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal\nstructure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the\nrelationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our\nframework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with\ndifferent lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting\nunveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows\ntransformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure\nin-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism\nto predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the\ncorresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a\n3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a\ntheoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to\nthe maximum likelihood solution.

In this study, we\npropose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and\nmacroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design\nconsiders the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network\ndefined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the\nmechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the\nhighlighted regions. The application of DBS and its effects, along with the\ninclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus\nexhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic\nconditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability,\nrather than driving the overall spiking activity.

We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only\npolarized dark-field scattering spectra input.

The gamma-ray precursor is\npowered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The\nprompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic\n$e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the\nrotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the\ncritical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH,\nand the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it.

Most existing\nliterature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in\nregression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is\nequally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous\nattributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In\npractice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,\nmethods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called\n\"fairness gerrymandering\", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional\nsubgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we\npropose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the\nassociation between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with\nthe fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear\nand nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of\nmultiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two\nmultivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously\nproposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance\ncovariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both\nregression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various\ntypes. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,\nincluding a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies\ndissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups.

Traditional planning methods excel at\nsolving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional\ninputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work\ncombined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an\nintermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using\nConflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,\nthis graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission\nefficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To\naddress this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that\ndynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\\Delta$) across\nagents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures\nthat each agent receives a local risk budget ($\\delta$) enabling more efficient\nnavigation while still respecting overall safety constraints.

    "abstract": "Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is\nessential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This\nevaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from\npotential collaborators, including historical performance and available\nresources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner\nindependently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data\nexchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in\nsignificant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)\nmodel based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent\narchitecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful\ncomputational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to\nmultidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics\nextraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving\ntask-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent\ntransfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,\nenabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation\ntime, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of\ncollaborator selection.",

In\ncontrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and\nthat popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases\nfrom transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and\nthose after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and\ntasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age\n(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we\nfind that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition\nparameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational\ndistribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several\nprompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have\ndistinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,\ntasks or demographics.

    "abstract": "Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of\nstrong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic\nconductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear\ntechnology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range\nrepulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that\nelectronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to\npredictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We\ninvestigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using\ndensity functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a\nclassical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that\ndirectional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion,\nmanifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent\nfriction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization\nfluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is\ntightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I-\ndynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all\nstructural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent\nagreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the\nability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body\npolarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce\nkey structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it\nneglects dynamic electronic fluctuations.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired\ngrowing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless\ncommunications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly\napplying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from\ntheir text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a\nspectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in\nmultiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral\ndetails and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.\nExtensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction\nperformance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\\text{dB}$\nnormalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based\nmethod.

We investigate all possible deformations of the Standard\nModel that produce quadratic growth with energy of the four-fermion scattering\namplitudes at the muon collider, and we derive sensitivity projections.\nElectroweak radiation emission gives access to new observable final states like\nfor instance the production of a charged pair of fermions by the emission of at\nleast one $W$ boson. This, combined with jet flavor tagging, improves the\nsensitivity and the ability to disentangle different interactions. Currently,\nthe best probes of flavor-breaking new physics are high-intensity low-energy\nmeasurements of lepton or hadron decays or oscillations. The high-energy probes\nof the same interactions at the muon collider are often competitive with\ncurrent bounds and strongly superior for some class of transitions.

While previous research has examined factors\ndriving overall engagement, less is known about why certain tweets receive\nunexpectedly high levels of one type of engagement relative to others. Drawing\non Signaling Theory and Attention Economy Theory, we investigate these\nunexpected engagement patterns on Twitter (now known as \"X\"), developing an\n\"unexpectedness quotient\" to quantify deviations from predicted engagement\nlevels. Our analysis of over 600,000 tweets reveals distinct patterns in how\ncontent characteristics influence unexpected engagement.

In contrast,\ngames and sports-related topics garner unexpected likes and comments,\nindicating higher emotional investment in these domains. The relationship\nbetween content attributes and engagement types follows clear patterns:\nsubjective tweets attract more likes while objective tweets receive more\nretweets, and longer, complex tweets with URLs unexpectedly receive more\nretweets. These findings demonstrate how users employ different engagement\ntypes as signals of varying strength based on content characteristics, and how\ncertain content types more effectively compete for attention in the social\nmedia ecosystem.

Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language\nexpressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.\nMoreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both\nobject grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object\nGrounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets\nopen-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target\nobjects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated\nobject instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp\nSynthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp\nAffordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp\nannotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion\nmodule and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,\nimproving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that\nOGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial\nlanguage instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX\n2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential\ngrasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy\ncompared to all the baselines considered.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning\nparadigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve\nmachine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\\v{c}}n{\\'y} et al.\n(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its\ninclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023\nUpdate) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).\nThe FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in\nless controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges\ndistinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we\nidentify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches\nto address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and\ndevices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.\nMoreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse\nforms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.\nOur contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical\nadvancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a\nguide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical\nmethods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,\nit offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical\nimplementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse\nprocess is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to\nexamine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,\noften uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.",

One\npromising avenue to constrain these processes is through the identification and\ncharacterisation of systems undergoing active mass transfer. Inspired by the\nslow brightening preceding stellar merger transients, we worked on a method to\nidentify Galactic mass-transferring binaries in which the donor is a\nHertzsprung gap (HG) star. We constructed an initial sample of HG stars using\nthe Gaia EDR3 contribution Starhorse catalogue, and we identified candidate\nmass-transferring systems by selecting sources that exhibit Balmer emission\nfeatures (using the low-resolution Gaia XP spectra), mid-infrared excess (from\nWISE photometry), and photometric variability (inferred from the error in the\nGaia G-band magnitude). This multi-criteria selection yielded a sample of 67\ncandidates, which we further analysed using complementary photometric and\nspectroscopic data. Among our candidates, we identified at least nine eclipsing\nbinaries and some sources that are potential binaries as well. Three sources in\nour sample are strong candidates for mass-transferring binaries with a yellow\ncomponent, and three more are binaries with a Be star. Notably, four sources in\nour sample are strong candidates for hosting a compact companion, based on\ntheir UV or X-ray signatures. The main sources of contamination in our search\nare hot but highly reddened stars (primarily Oe and Be stars). As an additional\noutcome of this work, we present a refined catalogue of 308 bona fide HG stars,\nselected using improved extinction corrections and stricter emission-line\ncriteria. This enhanced sample is expected to contain a significantly higher\nfraction of scientifically valuable mass-transferring binaries.",

This work makes the following contributions:\n(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in\ndecentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these\nstrategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with\napplying alignment across different contexts of use.

We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning\nRepresentation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that\nincorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and\nclinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During\npretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that\nshare similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are\ndissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological\nsimilarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically\nmeaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific\naugmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a\nhybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.\nResults: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,\nfor multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for\nbinary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,\nPhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,\nunderscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization.

In this paper, we investigate holographic beamforming designs for\nISAC systems, which, unlike existing holographic beamforming schemes developed\nfor RHS-aided communications, requires explicit consideration of mutual\ncoupling effects within RHS. This is because, different from prior works only\nconsidering communication performance, ISAC systems incorporate sensing\nfunctionality, which is sensitive to sidelobe levels. Ignoring mutual coupling\nin holographic beamforming can lead to notable undesired sidelobes, thus\ndegrading sensing performance.

    "abstract": "Transverse electromagnetic and electrostatic plasma wave modes propagating\nalong a background magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0$ are independent according to\nlinear kinetic theory. However, resonant interactions and energy exchange\nbetween waves and particles break this linear decoupling. This work tracks the\ncoupled evolution of Alfv\\'en-cyclotron (ACWs) and Ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) by\nsolving moment-based quasilinear equations for a collisionless plasma of\nbi-Maxwellian protons and Maxwellian electrons. Unlike earlier quasilinear\nstudies that adopt the cold-electron limit, our formulation retains the full\nkinetic response of both species, treating the electrons as a thermal reservoir\nto isolate proton heating. A parameter survey over $0.01\\leq\\beta_{\\parallel\np}\\leq10$ and $1\\le T_e/T_p\\le10$ shows that an ambient spectrum of ACWs can\ndrive significant perpendicular proton heating and raise the temperature\nanisotropy from initially isotropic conditions at low $\\beta_{\\parallel\np}\\lesssim0.1$, thereby triggering cyclotron instabilities. The quasilinear\nevolution self-regulates the ACW, driving the system toward a quasi-stationary\nstate with $\\gamma/\\Omega_p<10^{-1}$ and reduced anisotropy. As $T_e/T_p$\nincreases, IAWs become less damped and absorb a larger share of the fluctuation\nenergy through Landau resonance, reducing the efficiency of ACW-driven proton\nheating and thus regulating the instability. For sufficiently large\n$\\beta_{\\parallel p}$ or $T_e/T_p\\gtrsim5$, ACWs become inefficient drivers of\nperpendicular heating, leaving IAWs as the dominant dissipation channel. These\nresults explain how modest electrostatic activity in low-$\\beta$ environments\nsuch as the inner heliosphere and planetary magnetosheaths can regulate, but\nnot indefinitely sustain, cyclotron instabilities.",

Commonly used\nfunctions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on\nnearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,\nleading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse\nregions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index\nselection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance\n(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity\nmore effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical\nuse. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully\ndifferentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn\niterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise\ndistances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum\nassignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic\nruntime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable\noperations.

Upon perturbation, black holes emit a\nspectrum of damped sinusoids with specific, complex frequencies. Our analysis\nof the post-merger signal shows that at least two quasi-normal modes are\nrequired to explain the data, with the most damped remaining statistically\nsignificant for about one cycle. We probe the remnant's Kerr nature by\nconstraining the spectroscopic pattern of the dominant quadrupolar ($\\ell = m =\n2$) mode and its first overtone to match the Kerr prediction to tens of percent\nat multiple post-peak times. The measured mode amplitudes and phases agree with\na numerical-relativity simulation having parameters close to GW250114. By\nfitting a parameterized waveform that incorporates the full\ninspiral-merger-ringdown sequence, we constrain the fundamental $(\\ell=m=4)$\nmode to tens of percent and bound the quadrupolar frequency to within a few\npercent of the GR prediction. We perform a suite of tests -- spanning inspiral,\nmerger, and ringdown -- finding constraints that are comparable to, and in some\ncases 2-3 times more stringent than those obtained by combining dozens of\nevents in the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog.

We show how to avoid this singularity by\nadopting a different representation of the wave equation. Instead of the\nphysical space $x$ and the wavevector $k$, we use the ray time $\\tau$ as the\nnew canonical coordinate and the ray energy $h$ as the associated canonical\nmomentum. To derive the envelope equation in the $\\tau$-representation, we\nconstruct the Weyl symbol calculus on the $(\\tau, h)$ space and show that the\ncorresponding Weyl symbols are related to their $(x, k)$ counterparts by the\nAiry transform. This allows us to express the coefficients in the envelope\nequation through the known properties of the original dispersion operator. When\nnecessary, solutions of this equation can be mapped to the $x$-space using a\ngeneralised metaplectic transform. But the field per se might not even be\nneeded in practice. Instead, knowing the corresponding Wigner function usually\nsuffices for linear and quasilinear calculations. As a Weyl symbol itself, the\nWigner function can be mapped analytically, using the aforementioned Airy\ntransform. We show that the standard Airy patterns that form in regions where\nconventional GO fails are successfully reproduced within MGO simply by\nremapping the field from the $\\tau$-space to the $x$-space. An extension to\nmode-converting waves is also presented. This formulation, which we call\ngeneralised metaplectic GO (MGO) offers a promising tool, for example, for\nreduced modeling of the O--X conversion in inhomogeneous plasma near the\ncritical density, an effect that is important for fusion applications and also\noccurs in the ionosphere. Aside from better handling reflection, MGO is similar\nto GO and can replace it for any practical purposes.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expose\ncritical security vulnerabilities, necessitating the development of efficient\nand robust intrusion detection systems (IDS). Machine learning-based intrusion\ndetection systems (ML-IDS) have significantly improved threat detection\ncapabilities; however, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks.\nWhile numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance ML-IDS\nresilience, a systematic approach for selecting the most effective defense\nagainst a specific adversarial attack remains absent. To address this\nchallenge, we previously proposed DYNAMITE, a dynamic defense selection\napproach that identifies the most suitable defense against adversarial attacks\nthrough an ML-driven selection mechanism. Building on this foundation, we\npropose SAGE (Sample-Aware Guarding Engine), a substantially improved defense\nalgorithm that integrates active learning with targeted data reduction. It\nemploys an active learning mechanism to selectively identify the most\ninformative input samples and their corresponding optimal defense labels, which\nare then used to train a second-level learner responsible for selecting the\nmost effective defense. This targeted sampling improves computational\nefficiency, exposes the model to diverse adversarial strategies during\ntraining, and enhances robustness, stability, and generalizability. As a\nresult, SAGE demonstrates strong predictive performance across multiple\nintrusion detection datasets, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 201%\nover the state-of-the-art defenses. Notably, SAGE narrows the performance gap\nto the Oracle to just 3.8%, while reducing computational overhead by up to 29x.",

    "abstract": "Doppler planet searches are complicated by stellar activity, through which\ncyclical changes in the host star's photosphere and chromosphere can mask or\nmimic planetary signals. A popular technique for modeling stellar activity is\nto apply a quasiperiodic Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which provides a\nflexible model with rigorous error propagation. However, observers must guard\nagainst overfitting, as a GP may be flexible enough to subsume other signals\nbesides the one it is intended to model. To counteract overfitting, we\nintroduce a curvature-penalizing objective function for fitting GP models to\nlong-term magnetic activity cycles. We also demonstrate that a Gaussian filter\ncan be an effective method of detrending radial velocities (RVs) so that\nshorter-period signals can be extracted even in the absence of a mathematical\nmodel of the long-term trend. We apply our methods to the heavily studied 55\nCancri system, fitting Keplerian orbits plus the GP activity-cycle model. We\nshow that a 4-Keplerian model that includes planets b, c, e, and f combined\nwith a GP for the activity cycle performs at least as well as the widely\nagreed-upon 5-planet system with its own GP activity model. Our results suggest\nthat the existence of planet d cannot be established from the RVs alone;\nadditional data are required for confirmation.",

To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15\nsociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on\nfalse refusal.

    "abstract": "Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order\ngeneralizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and\nscrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term\nboundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is\nanalytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free\ncumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact\nexpressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show\nthese to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by\nthe identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the\neffect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight\ninto the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics\nand show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the\nconstruction of exactly-solvable many-body models.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of deterministically cloning quantum channels with\nrespect to the best attainable rate and the highest quality, so-called optimal\ncloning. We demonstrate that cloning quantum states is, in-fact, equivalent to\ncloning the trash-and-replace channel and therefore the former is a special\ncase of the more general problem. By appealing to higher-order quantum\noperations (quantum processes) we construct a unified framework to deal with\nthe most general cloning tasks and establish necessary conditions for a family\nof channels to exhibit super-replication -- a quadratic cloning rate with\nvanishing error. We find that noisy phase-gate channels satisfy these\nconditions, and we construct the explicit super-replicating process for the\ntask. Conversely, we find that the criteria are not met by the full set of\nnoisy unitary gates; classical noise channels; or amplitude damping channels,\nwhose respective cloning rates are at most linear. In this paradigm, we not\nonly derive new results, but also refigure known ones. We derive a strong\nconverse for state cloning, and for unitary channels we construct an\nalternative super-replication process to that of D\\\"ur et al. [PRL 114, 120503\n(2015)] and Chiribella et al. [PRL 114, 120504 (2015)] based on a\nmeasure-and-prepare process, which allows us to establish a direct connection\nbetween optimal channel cloning and Bayesian channel estimation. Finally we\ngive an SDP algorithm to search for optimal cloning processes and study the\nadvantage of coherent vs measure-and-prepare protocols on concrete examples.",

    "abstract": "High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but\nthe use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests\nof data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been\nproposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the\ntraining availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and\nthe powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these\ndata are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,\nthey will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we\nfind that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.\nThis phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly\nunlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective\nof model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the\nconvergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model\narchitecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of\nthe critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,\nimplying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.\nConsequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons\nfor UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the\nunlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose\nan Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the\nSAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we\nconduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed\nUD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of\nexisting unlearnable methods.",

We investigate two complementary FS analysis approaches:\nfull-modelling (FM) and ShapeFit (SF), each with distinct sensitivities to the\nassumed fiducial model. Across all tracers, we find for FM that systematic\nshifts induced by fiducial cosmology mismatches remain well below the DESI DR1\nstatistical uncertainties, with maximum deviations of 0.22$\\sigma_\\mathrm{DR1}$\nin $\\Lambda$CDM scenarios and 0.12$\\sigma_\\mathrm{DR1+SN}$ when including SN Ia\nmock data in extended $w_0w_a$CDM fits.

    "abstract": "Measuring relativistic effects on cosmological scales would provide further\nconfirmation of the validity of general relativity in the still poorly tested\ncondition of weak gravity. Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in\nthe distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection,\nmainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are\nplagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy\nclustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples -- bright\nand faint -- and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in\nharmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in\nmagnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost\nthe impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading\nrelativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a\ncarefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected. Then, we look at the\nsub-dominant effects predicted by general relativity and quantify how their\nstatistical significance, as yet undetectable, varies with redshift binning and\nsurvey specifications. As case studies, we consider in our forecasts a bright\ngalaxy sample at low redshift, an H$\\alpha$ emission-line galaxy survey at\nintermediate redshifts, and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies at high\nredshift.",

Our aim is to characterise their X-ray spectra and explore\nrelations between X-ray luminosity and other bands, comparing powerful QSOs\nwith the general AGN population. We performed spectral analysis for about half\nof the sample; 16 sources were analysed via their hardness ratio; for the\nothers we estimated their intrinsic luminosity $L_{2-10\\,keV}$. Only 8 sources\nare undetected. We report a large dispersion in $L_{2-10\\,keV}$ despite the\nnarrow distribution of $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\\,\\r{A}}$ and $\\lambda L_{6\\,\\mu m}$\n(about one-third of the sources classified as X-ray weak). This suggests\ndifferences in X-ray corona and accretion flow physics between hyper-luminous\nand less powerful AGN. X-ray photon index distribution is consistent with that\nof lower-$z$, lower-$L_{bol}$ AGN, and does not depend on the Eddington ratio\n($\\lambda_{Edd}$) or X-ray weakness. Most WISSH QSOs with intrinsic absorption\nestimates show little to no obscuration ($N_H \\le 5\\times 10^{22}\\,cm^{-2}$).\nAmong the obscured sources we find blue QSOs without broad absorption lines\nwithin the \"forbidden region\" of the $Log(N_H)-Log(\\lambda_{Edd})$ plane,\ntypically occupied by dust-reddened QSOs and associated with intense feedback.\nWe confirm a correlation between $L_{2-10\\,keV}$ and CIV line blueshift, a\ntracer of nuclear ionized outflows. Multi-wavelength data and complete X-ray\ncoverage enabled the investigation of the disk-corona interplay at the highest\nluminosity regimes. The broad distribution of bolometric correction and X-ray -\nto - optical index suggest caution when using $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\\,\\r{A}}$ or\n$L_{6\\,\\mu m}$ as direct X-ray proxy for individual luminous QSOs.",

Post-merger data excluding the peak region are consistent with the\ndominant quadrupolar $(\\ell = |m| = 2)$ mode of a Kerr black hole and its first\novertone. We constrain the modes' frequencies to $\\pm 30\\%$ of the Kerr\nspectrum, providing a test of the remnant's Kerr nature. We also examine\nHawking's area law, also known as the second law of black hole mechanics, which\nstates that the total area of the black hole event horizons cannot decrease\nwith time. A range of analyses that exclude up to 5 of the strongest merger\ncycles confirm that the remnant area is larger than the sum of the initial\nareas to high credibility.",

    "abstract": "Stage IV cosmological surveys will map the universe with unprecedented\nprecision, reducing statistical uncertainties to levels where unmodelled\nsystematics can significantly bias inference. In particular, photometric\nredshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly\naccounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The\nincreasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing\nlow signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z\nmeasurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially\nproblematic for 3$\\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy\nclustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g.\n5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to\n1.8${\\sigma}$ in ${\\Omega}_M$ and ${\\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\\sigma}$ in the IA\nredshift evolution parameter ${\\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible\nweighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most\ncontamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This\nmethod mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing\ncosmological parameter biases to below 1${\\sigma}$ without substantially\ndegrading constraining power. Our approach offers a practical solution for\nfuture analyses, enabling robust cosmological inference in the presence of\ncatastrophic redshift errors.",

    "abstract": "Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are at least an order of magnitude\nbrighter than standard supernovae, with the internal power source for their\nluminosity still unknown. The central engines of SLSNe-I are hypothesized to be\nmagnetars, but the majority of SLSNe-I light curves have multiple bumps or\npeaks that are unexplained by the standard magnetar model. Existing\nexplanations for the bumps either modulate the central engine luminosity or\ninvoke interactions with material in the circumstellar environment. Systematic\nsurveys of the limited sample of SLSNe-I light curves find no compelling\nevidence favoring either scenario, leaving both the nature of the light-curve\nfluctuations and the applicability of the magnetar model unresolved. Here, we\nreport high-cadence multiband observations of an SLSN-I with clear \"chirped\"\n(i.e., decreasing period) light-curve bumps that can be directly linked to the\nproperties of the magnetar central engine. Our observations are consistent with\na tilted, infalling accretion disk undergoing Lense-Thirring precession around\na magnetar centrally located within the expanding supernova ejecta. Our model\ndemonstrates that the overall light curve and bump frequency independently and\nself-consistently constrain the spin period and the magnetic field strength of\nthe magnetar. Assuming standard accretion disk parameters, we constrain the\naccretion rate onto the magnetar. Our results provide the first observational\nevidence of the Lense-Thirring effect in the environment of a magnetar, and\nconfirm the magnetar spin-down model as an explanation for the extreme\nluminosity observed in SLSNe-I. We anticipate this discovery will create\navenues for testing general relativity in a new regime -- the violent centers\nof young supernovae.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested some time ago that many black hole properties are not\nspecific to gravity, but rather are shared by a large class of objects, the\nso-called saturons, that saturate the quantum field theoretic upper bound on\nmicrostate degeneracy. By now, various aspects of this universality have been\nunderstood and demonstrated in a number of explicit examples. In the present\npaper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a\nsimple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black\nhole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the\nevaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously\nbroken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions. We show that the decay\nrate as well as the characteristic energy of the emitted quanta are given by\nthe inverse size of the object, in striking similarity with the Hawking\nevaporation of a black hole. The time-scale of information retrieval also\nmatches the one previously suggested for a black hole by Page. We give the\nsemiclassical derivation of the phenomenon as well as its fully quantum\nresolution as a decaying coherent state of Goldstone bosons. The universal\nnature of the effect and its microscopic understanding support the analogous\nquantum portrait of a black hole as a saturated coherent state of gravitons.",

We take\nadvantage of the expected gamma-ray flux sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope\nArray Observatory (CTAO) toward the direction of the Galactic Centre and Dwarf\nGalaxies and its exquisite energy resolution to derive upper limits on\nfermionic and scalar dark matter annihilations into gamma-ray lines. We\nconsider the lowest-order effective operators for scalar and fermion dark\nmatter, and derive limits on the energy scale using the recent CTAO projected\nsensitivity. Putting our findings into perspective with existing limits from\ndirect and indirect detection experiments, we conclude that CTAO will either\nplay a complementary role or be a discovery channel for dark matter signals.",

High energy partons\nwithin jets can trigger these high-momentum exchanges, making jets valuable\nprobes for revealing the presence of such quasi-particles. Such elastic\nscatterings are implemented in the Hybrid Model, where a jet parton that\nscatters is deflected, kicking a medium parton, which recoils. Before and after\na scattering, as one and then both partons propagate through the medium, they\nlose energy and momentum, exciting wakes in the QGP droplet. We use two-point\nand three-point energy-energy correlators (EECs) to reveal the relevant angular\nregions at which (modified) parton showers and wakes in the QGP each dominate,\noffering a new way with which to visualize and constrain the corresponding\ndynamics. We compare our calculations to recent CMS and ALICE measurements of\ntwo-point EECs of charged-particle tracks in jets produced in PbPb collisions.\nWe show that our calculations are closest to the experimental measurements when\nelastic scattering is included and when the elastically scattered\nrecoil-partons produce their own wakes.

Our study of the quiescent galaxy\npopulation is based on a machine-learning classification tool based on\nrest-frame magnitudes. The algorithm learns from several traditional methods to\nestimate the probability of a galaxy being quiescent, achieving high precision\nand recall. Starting from this classification, we computed quiescent galaxy\nfractions within groups via two methods: one based on the membership\nprobabilities provided by AMICO, which rely on an analytical model, and another\nusing a model-independent technique. We then detected the RS by estimating the\nridgeline position using photometric data, followed by sigma clipping to remove\noutliers. This analysis was performed using both rest-frame and observed-frame\nmagnitudes with rest-frame matching. We compared the results from both\napproaches and investigated the $z$ and richness dependence of the RS\nparameters. We found that the quiescent galaxy population in groups builds up\nsteadily from z=1.5-2 across all richnesses, with faster and earlier growth in\nthe richest groups. The first galaxies settle onto the RS ridgeline by $z \\sim\n2$, consistent with current evolutionary scenarios. Notably, we reported a rare\noverdensity of quiescent galaxies at z=3.4, potentially one of the most distant\nearly RSs observed. Extending our study to X-rays, we found that X-ray faint\ngroups have, on average, lower quiescent fractions than X-ray bright ones,\nlikely reflecting their typical location in filaments.

    "abstract": "The present-day mass function of supermassive black holes is the most\nimportant observable quantity for the prediction and theoretical interpretation\nof the gravitational wave background (GWB) measured by pulsar timing arrays\n(PTAs). Due to the limited sample size of galaxies with dynamically inferred\nSMBH masses, more readily measurable galaxy properties $X$ that correlate with\nthe black hole mass are used as labels (via scaling relations $M_{\\bullet}-X$),\nwhich can then be counted in a larger galaxy catalog to produce a measurement\nof the mass function. Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass\nfunction is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations\nand galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the\ncharacteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass\nproxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both\ncatalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce\nsignificant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore\nmeasurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a\nset of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them. This\nenables us to investigate internal inconsistencies that lead to discrepancies\nin the final black hole abundance, while minimizing observational systematic\nbiases induced by combining disparate sets of measurements. We focus on 3\nproxies: the velocity dispersion $\\sigma$, K-band luminosity $L$, and a\ncombination of $L$ and radius $R$ defined by the fundamental plane. We show\nthat all three can be reconciled to some degree, but highlight the remaining\ndependence on poorly-quantified systematic corrections between the scaling\nrelation catalogs and the mass function catalogs, as well as the potential\nimpact of selection effects.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of an axion-like particle above the QCD line would rule out\nGrand Unified Theories, including the perturbative heterotic string with the\nStandard Model embedded in a single $E_8$ factor or $SO(32)$. In this work we\nstudy a possible loophole to this observation, given by compactifications of\nthe $E_8\\times E_8$ heterotic string with a non-standard embedding of the\nStandard Model into the 10-dimensional gauge group. If electromagnetism is\nembedded into both $E_8$ factors, axions can couple to photons via the anomaly\nwithout coupling to QCD. We obtain upper bounds to the coupling-to-mass ratio\n$g_{a\\gamma}/m_a$ for these axion-like particles as a function of the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale and the unified gauge coupling. To be compatible\nwith the measured gauge couplings and the weak mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta_w$ at\nlow-energies, phenomenologically viable models with non-standard $U(1)_Y$\nembedding require sizeable one-loop threshold corrections from string states\nand/or charged matter at intermediate energy scales. We study how these effects\nmodify the tree-level upper bounds to $g_{a\\gamma}/m_a$ and show that, in the\nperturbative regime, they reduce the leading order estimates. Axion-like\nparticles far above the QCD line are only possible in certain models where\nperturbation theory is lost. The main conclusion is that the discovery of an\naxion violating the bounds found in this work would be incompatible with large\nclasses of otherwise phenomenologically viable string models, including the\nperturbative heterotic $SO(32)$ and $E_8\\times E_8$ string, the type-I string,\nand certain heterotic M-theories.

For the extragalactic component, in addition to\nthe prompt and inverse Compton contributions, we also include cascade photons\narising from inverse Compton scattering of pair-produced electrons and\npositrons. By combining all these contributions, we derive constraints on the\ndark matter parameter space. Our bounds for various two body Standard Model\nfinal states are strongest to date.

We present a novel view of the\n$z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust\ncontinuum and [CII]158$\\mu$m line observations.

However, activating such capabilities through training\nremains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced\nimitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we\npropose \\textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework\nthat enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning\ntasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses\nthe cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT\non prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel\nthinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on\nharder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,\nand AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,\nleading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model\ntrained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear\nshift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel\nthinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same\ncapability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate\nparallel thinking as a \\textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this\ntemporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,\nyielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25.

In this paper, we present\nVIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization\nstrategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of\npre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this\nalignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details\nfrom the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual\nknowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex\nvisual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all\ntasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying\nour framework.

Our measurements indicate that\nsuperconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead,\nits critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth\nin compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two.

Thermal\ndensity functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging\nphase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the\nexchange-correlation free energy. In this work, a finite-temperature extension\nof the two-legged adiabatic connection construction is demonstrated for the\nuniform electron gas and asymmetric Hubbard dimer at warm dense matter\nconditions. This provides the structure of a temperature- and density-dependent\nweighting scheme for a hybrid exchange-correlation approximation. The\nconstruction also provides evidence that nonlinear thermal effects on the\nbalance between exchange and correlation, as well as that between kinetic,\nentropic, and potential components of the correlation, persist and can even be\nemphasized by strong electron-electron interaction. These findings point\nadditionally to a complicated interplay between temperature, density, and\ninteraction strength in the strong correlation character of these model\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools\nwith reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.",

This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to\ncapture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess\nthe practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images\nof the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH\nsignals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses\nwith image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru\ntelescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for\ntypical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and\nquads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find\nthat time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC\nmocks.

Analysis of a real lens led to a\ndifference in time-delay estimates of $\\mathcal{O}(\\rm days)$ between the\npredictions derived from HST and HSC data.

    "abstract": "Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a\nsignificant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level\ntrajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,\nspatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that\nenables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution\ndirectly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an\ninformation-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively\nhighlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues\nare structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently\nintegrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical\nbehavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance\nefficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy\nthat autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit\ngeometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly\nbenchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial\ngeneralization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation\nachieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the\nlanguage-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When\ndeployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%\nplacement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,\nletter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong\ngeneralization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.",

This is due to the inefficiency\nof existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.\nTo address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on\nhuman-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we\nfine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate\nrecovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human\noperators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot\nback to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective\nsegment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition\nexpands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,\nwhich we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on\nlong-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt\nhanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated\nassembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\\times$ less\ndata collection time and samples.

    "abstract": "Many real-world networks, ranging from subway systems to polymer structures\nand fungal mycelia, do not form by the incremental addition of individual nodes\nbut instead grow through the successive extension and intersection of lines or\nfilaments. Yet most existing models for spatial network formation focus on\nnode-based growth, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of systems\nbuilt from spatially extended components. Here we introduce a minimal model for\nspatial networks, rooted in the iterative growth and intersection of lines-a\nmechanism inspired by diverse systems including transportation networks, fungal\nhyphae, and vascular structures. Unlike classical approaches, our model\nconstructs networks by sequentially adding lines across a domain populated with\nrandomly distributed points. Each line grows greedily to maximize local\ncoverage, while subject to angular continuity and the requirement to intersect\nexisting structures. This emphasis on extended, interacting elements governed\nby local optimization and geometric constraints leads to the spontaneous\nemergence of a core-and-branches architecture. The resulting networks display a\nrange of non-trivial scaling behaviors: the number of intersections grows\nsubquadratically; Flory exponents and fractal dimensions emerge consistent with\nempirical observations; and spatial scaling exponents depend on the\nheterogeneity of the underlying point distribution, aligning with measurements\nfrom subway systems. Our model thus captures key organizational features\nobserved across diverse real-world networks, establishing a universal paradigm\nthat goes beyond node-based approaches and demonstrates how the growth of\nspatially extended elements can shape the large-scale architecture of complex\nsystems.",

While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in\nsingle-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous\nenvironments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often\nconstrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address\nthese challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the\noverall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces\non extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by\nmitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,\n\\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load\nacross the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \\textit{dynamic\nparameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA\nadapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge\nretention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks\nsuch as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying\nexclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains\nperformance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when\naugmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance while requiring only 80\\% of the single-task\nenvironment interaction steps.

Changing the model formulation from the\nannealed (homogeneous agents with varying behavior) to quenched (heterogeneous\nagents with fixed behavior) produces discontinuous phase transitions.

    "abstract": "As photometric surveys reach unprecedented statistical precision, systematic\nuncertainties increasingly dominate large-scale structure probes relying on\ngalaxy number density. Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it\nexcludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For\ngalaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing,\nare a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive\nspatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the\napplicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability.\nThe complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint\nconservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation.\nWe present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint,\nintegrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that\ndegrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial\nseed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES\nYear 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the\nIterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear\nsystematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's\nimpact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it\nremains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain\nw(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy\nclustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting\nthe basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses.

    "abstract": "Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language\nModels(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all\nskill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic\noften results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in\ngenerated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual\ndebugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness\nand security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces\nnew attack surfaces.\n  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in\nRetrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency\nhijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden\nmalicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting\ndual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM\nsuggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel\nattack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam\nsearch optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in\nretrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate\njailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious\ndependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and\nJavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for\npopular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able\nto succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both\ncustom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply\nchain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security\nalignment for code generation tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in\nautomating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of\nfaster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems.\nExisting LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided\nreasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a\nresult, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting\nunused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior\ntactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration\ntesting LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the\nMITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the\nLLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies\nand filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more\nproductive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated\npenetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and\nGPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with\n103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our\nproposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and\n78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.\nComparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using\nself-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and\nrequired 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries. This suggests that\nincorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments",

JADE integrates\nphotoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles\nfrom an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where\ndynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically\nconsidered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar\nspin-orbit angle that has survived within the \"hot Neptune desert\" despite\nongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000\nsimulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian\ninference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the\nproperties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results\nsuggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial\natmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout\nits history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion\ninducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80{\\deg}\n- 100{\\deg} with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By\ncombining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we\nidentified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found\nthat it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a\nuseful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how\ncoupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets\nand explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.",

While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,\nthese metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This\npaper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX\n4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by\nsystem-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To\novercome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive\nInference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no\narchitectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference\nstrategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit\nand resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs\nwithin a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution\npass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection\nconfidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x\nspeedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.\nThis work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying\nhigh-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus\nfrom pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that\nmaximize throughput.",

In\nparticular, we show that replacing exact proximal steps with HJ-Prox\napproximations in algorithms such as proximal gradient descent,\nDouglas-Rachford splitting, Davis-Yin splitting, and the primal-dual hybrid\ngradient method still ensures convergence under mild conditions.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the\nPRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across\nsix bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being\nclassified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio\n(B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR > 175 M_sun yr^{-1})\nand the faint group (SFR < 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant\nstatistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that\nSMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer\nwavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge,\nindicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and\nhigher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index,\nchallenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T > 0.5, n > 4)\nversus pseudo-bulges (B/T < 0.35, n < 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric\nmeasurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24\npercent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with\ndisturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows\npseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular\nevolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent\nof SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7)\nbut low Sersic index (n_bulge <= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs.\nThis work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers,\nsupporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow\nplays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.",

    "abstract": "Molecular communication (MC) provides a quantitative framework for analyzing\ninformation transfer within biological systems. This paper introduces a novel\nand comprehensive MC framework for the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a system of six\ncoupled, nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs). The proposed model\ndefines a bidirectional feedback loop with a gut-to-brain inflammatory channel\nand a brain-to-gut neuroendocrine channel. Under prolonged stress, this\nfeedback loop becomes self-perpetuating and drives the system into a\npathological state. We evaluate the end-to-end channel across varying\nconditions using time-domain simulations, small-signal frequency-domain\ncharacterization, and an information-theoretic capacity analysis. At\nhomeostasis, the system maintains stable circadian dynamics with higher\ninformation throughput, whereas sustained stress drives a shift to dysregulated\nhypercortisolism. In this pathological state, spectral efficiency decreases due\nto a narrowed effective bandwidth and a lower passband gain driven by\nneuroendocrine delays and saturating cytokine-hormone kinetics. These results\nquantify the impact of these signaling mechanisms on stability and information\nprocessing, elucidating the transition from healthy circadian rhythms to a\npersistent pathological state of hypercortisolism.",

We show that addressing duplicate ACKs is\ninsufficient. Instead, we explain that since CCAs are typically designed for\nsingle-path routing, their estimation function focuses on the latest feedback\nand mishandles feedback that reflects multiple paths. We propose to use a\nmedian feedback that is more robust to the varying signals that come with\nmultiple paths. We introduce MSwift, which applies this principle to make\nGoogle's Swift robust to multi-path routing while keeping its incast tolerance\nand single-path performance.

The\n4DSTEM characterization reveals that the synthesis of the thermodynamically\nstable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation process from the 1T to\n1T$'$ resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently\noriented 1T$'$ crystals. Our MOCVD growth of complex and distorted phases of 2D\nCrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of\n2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and\nspintronics.",

    "abstract": "We investigate and compare QCD dipole cascade models, the 1D Mueller dipole\nmodel, its high energy limit and its generalization that follows from studies\nof 1D systems with conformal symmetry. To address the ambiguity stemming from\ndifferent definitions of the rapidity ranges in experimental measurements, we\npropose the entropy as the function of the logarithm of the average\nmultiplicity, $S(\\ln\\langle n \\rangle)$, as a universal observable. From the\nsolutions of the models, we calculate both the entropy and the average charged\nparticle multiplicity and compare to data measured in proton-proton collisions.\nWe obtained these quantities directly from the measured multiplicity\ndistributions and determine the model parameters via fits. We find that the\ngeneralized dipole model provides a significantly better description of the\ndata than the 1D Mueller model.",

This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home\nenvironments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep\nonset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.\nautomatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent\nresearch has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for\nvarious phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive\nsleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel\nin-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a\nwearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:\n24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\\\"atwyler SoftPulse)\nas a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground\ntruth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep\nstaging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake\nvs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)\nusing leave-one-subject-out validation.

However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:\nthey neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics\ncompetitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance\ncomparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first\nbenchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned\nevaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)\nComprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,\nspanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed\nmodalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)\nProfessional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform\nfine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with\nhuman examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)\nComparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to\nmodels based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison\nbetween (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30\nstate-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly\nremain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress\nwith occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold\nmedals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These\nresults highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and\ntop students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source\nreasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for\nimprovement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused\nbenchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and\navailable at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.",

This\nwork presents an empirical comparison using Go and Node.js applications,\nrepresenting ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation,\nrespectively. While unikernels consistently deliver faster startup times and\noutperform containers for Go-based workloads in resource-constrained\nenvironments, the evaluation results identify a critical performance crossover\nfor Node.js. Below a certain memory threshold, Docker containers maintain\nstable performance for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound applications, while the\nNanos unikernel's performance degrades sharply. This reveals that Linux's\nmemory management capabilities can outweigh the minimalist efficiency of\nunikernels under resource scarcity, a critical trade-off that, until now, has\nnot been adequately quantified for JIT runtimes in this context.

Methods were classified according to three major\nfamilies -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on\ntheir ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length,\nmultivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates,\nand large data volumes.\n  Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129\nmethods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and\nepidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal\nMatching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based\nmethods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data\nstructures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant\ncovariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average\nmore scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to\nfacilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics (\nhttps://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ )\n  Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches\noffer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable.

A family of Bargmann-like representations\n(called $z$-Bargmann representations) introduces naturally the larger space.\nThe $z$-Bargmann representations are defined through semi-unitary matrices\n(which are a coherent states formalism in disguise). The `openness' of the\nsystem is quantified with the probability current that flows from the system to\nthe external world. The Grothendieck quantity ${\\cal Q}$ is shown to be related\nto the probability current, and is used as a figure of merit for the `openness'\nof a system. ${\\cal Q}$ is expressed in terms of `rescaling transformations'\nwhich change not only the phase but also the absolute value of the\nwavefunction, and are intimately linked to irreversible phenomena (e.g.,\ndamping/amplification). It is shown that unitary transformations in the\nisolated system $\\Sigma(2d)$ (full universe), reduce to rescaling\ntransformations when projected to its open subsystem $\\Sigma(d)$. The values of\nthe Grothendieck ${\\cal Q}$ for various quantum states in an open system, are\ncompared with those for their counterpart states in an isolated system.",

Previously, the main quantum query lower bound methods\nwere the polynomial method, the adversary method, and the multiplicative\nadversary method, and their relative powers were well understood. In this work,\nwe situate the compressed oracle technique within this established landscape,\nby showing that it is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method. To\naccomplish this, we introduce a simplified restriction of the multiplicative\nadversary method, the MLADV method, that remains powerful enough to capture the\npolynomial method and exhibit a strong direct product theorem, but is much\nsimpler to reason about. We show that the compressed oracle technique is also\ncaptured by the MLADV method.

If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered\nproblematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness\ncorrectly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we\nsystematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and\nidentical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the\nquestion of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To\nstudy this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification\ntasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans\nand LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt\nmodifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative\nlabel sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is\nless affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of\nLLMs.",

The optimization effort requires efficient wake models\nto predict the wake flow and, subsequently, the power generation of wind farms\nwith reasonable accuracy and low computational cost. Wake flow predictions\nusing large-eddy simulation (LES) ensure high fidelity, while reduced-order\nmodels, e.g., the Gaussian-curl hybrid (GCH), provide computational efficiency.\nWe integrate LES results and the GCH model to develop a machine learning (ML)\nframework based on an autoencoder-based convolutional neural network, allowing\nfor a reliable and cost-effective prediction of the wake flow field. We trained\nthe ML model using high-fidelity LES results as the target vector, while\nlow-fidelity data from the GCH model serve as the input vector. The efficiency\nof the ML model to predict the AEP of the South Fork wind farm, offshore Rhode\nIsland, was illustrated. Then, we integrated the ML model into a greedy\noptimization algorithm to determine the optimal wind farm layout in terms of\nturbine positioning. The optimized wind farm layout is shown to achieve a 2.\n05\\% improvement in AEP over the existing wind farm.",

As the disk evolves and disperses, the truncation radius is\nexpected to move outward as the balance between magnetic and viscous forces\nshifts. Planets migrating inward can become trapped near the inner edge, but as\nthe edge itself moves outward, the evolving disk torques can drive planets to\nmigrate outward as well. We employ N-body simulations to assess the influence\nof magnetospheric cavity expansion on the dynamical evolution and orbital\narchitectures of compact resonant chains of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our\nresults show that rebound-driven expansion of the disk's inner edge plays a\npivotal role in destabilizing resonant chains by spreading planetary systems\noutward, thereby triggering early dynamical instabilities and giant impacts.\nDespite this dynamical evolution, key observable properties of close-in\nplanetary systems -- such as the distribution of orbital period ratio, the\nintra-system similarity in planet sizes (``radius uniformity''), and the\nbimodal distribution of planet radii known as the ``radius valley'' -- remain\nlargely consistent with those of systems formed without the rebound effect, in\nwhich the inner edge of the disk remains fixed.

Starting from a minimal electronic model where\nsuperconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium,\nwe introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an\nenvironment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic\nenvironment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which\nbreaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order.\nIn the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from\ncontinuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast,\nthe charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity\nfrequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct\nordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point.

This study introduces\nNeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye\ntracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants\ncompleted a 360{\\deg} cube-selection task using three different input methods:\nVR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance\nwas measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was\nevaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully\nsupported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors\nthan the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting\na classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical\ndemand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user\npreferences were mixed. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid\nEEG+gaze systems for everyday VR use, highlighting their ergonomic benefits and\ninclusivity potential.

Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in\ncurrent LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken\nlanguage reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization\nin instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up\nperformance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex\ninstruction following downstream tasks.

Further, a tight therapeutic window\nmakes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a\nmeans of guiding drug response prediction.

This study investigates the added value of unstructured\ncrash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with\nstructured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the\nnarratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of\nclass imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to\nthe training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from\nKentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three\nroad classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes\n(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four\nbroader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and\n(3) a unified dataset without classification.

It is found that the range-based IOL guidance law exhibits a\nsingularity under certain conditions. To address this issue, a fuzzy logic\nsystem is employed to smoothly blend the IOL guidance with the classical\nproportional guidance law, thereby avoiding the singularity. In contrast, the\nLOS-based IOL guidance law is free of singularities but suffers from divergence\nissues due to angle-related complications.

In our study, we implement a comprehensive approach\nwithin the perturbative QCD parton model that incorporates both elastic and\ninelastic energy loss mechanisms. For elastic processes the contribution from\nrecoiling thermal partons reduces the net in-cone energy loss for a given jet\nradius. For inelastic processes, we account for the angular distribution of\nradiated gluons, the thermalization of soft gluons, and transverse-momentum\nbroadening. Using this framework, we calculate the jet nuclear modification\nfactors ($R_{AA}$) and their double ratios $R_{AA}(R=0.2-1.0)/R_{AA}(R=0.2)$,\nand systematically compare with ALICE, ATLAS and CMS data in 0-10\\% and 30-50\\%\nPb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02~TeV. Numerical results show that\n$R_{AA}$ increases with the cone size $R$ because the in-cone energy loss\ndecreases at larger radii. Specifically, as the radius $R$ grows, the\nprobability for elastically scattered partons to escape the jet cone and the\nlikelihood for radiated gluons to fall outside the cone both decrease,\nresulting in a net reduction of energy loss.

Such formulations inherently assume the state of the modeled\nenvironment cannot be accessed directly but instead the controller can observe\nonly noisy measurements of the state and, therefore, at each decision stage\nsome form of state estimation is required before a control is actuated. The\nnotion of sensor management arises when the modeled controls not only affect\nthe subsequent evolution of the state but can also affect the nature of future\nmeasurements and, hence, the quality of state estimates that drive future\ncontrol decisions. In principle, the optimal strategy for any appropriately\nmodeled multi-stage stochastic control problem with imperfect state information\n(with or without opportunity for sensor management) is the solution to a\ndynamic program; in practice, the computational requirements are typically\nprohibitive yet dynamic programming methods are still useful to guide the\ndevelopment of effective suboptimal strategies. In this spirit, we model the\nopportunity for sensor management within small-scale examples of two\nwell-studied dynamic programming formulations, namely (1) the\nfinite-state/finite-action Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process\n(PO-MDP) and (2) the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Regulator (LQGR). These examples\nadmit solvable dynamic programs and confirm how the interplay between sensing\nand acting is a natural by-product of a dynamic programming solution.",

However, signals from different users\nwill interfere with each other in the optical intermediate frequency (IF)\ndomain of the multi-band quantum receiver, which is termed the IF interference\n(IFI) problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-input\nmulti-output (MIMO) architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQ-MIMO)\nby exploiting the additional spatial diversity of MIMO receivers. Specifically,\nby applying the dynamic signal model of RAQRs, we clarify the physical\nrelationship between the quantum local oscillator (LO) configurations and the\nmulti-band gains with the concept of quantum transconductance. Then, with the\nquantum transconductance-based signal model, we formulate the spectral\nefficiency (SE) maximization problem and further propose the quantum weighted\nminimum mean square error (qWMMSE) algorithm, which jointly optimizes the\nquantum LO configurations and the classical precoder/combiner matrices.\nFurthermore, we test the qWMMSE algorithm within the standard space division\nmultiple access (SDMA) scheme and the frequency division multiple access (FDMA)\nscheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the qWMMSE optimization framework\ncan significantly improve the SE of RAQ-MIMO systems for both multiple access\nschemes, and that RAQ-MIMO systems can outperform classical electronic\nreceiver-based multi-user MIMO systems by eliminating the mutual coupling\neffect between classical antennas.",

    "abstract": "3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a\nprevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong\ngeneralization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation\nmisalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds\nconvey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits\nboth input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative\nRepresentation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target\nsemantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.\nThis mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances\nresilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within\nLLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation\nDecoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying\nLLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving\ncomprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments\nshow that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and\n+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains\nacross 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.",

Two primary vapor\ncell designs are evaluated: translationally invariant \"open\" cells and\nperiodically structured \"supported\" cells composed entirely of low-loss glass,\nas well as hybrid structures incorporating highly doped silicon. Our\nsimulations reveal that the structured all-glass vapor cells exhibit sharp,\nangle- and polarization-dependent resonant peaks due to guided-mode coupling,\nresulting in localized RF power enhancements exceeding 8x. In contrast,\nsilicon-based structures demonstrate significant electric field attenuation and\nsuppression of resonant features due to their high dielectric losses. Through\nk-vector and angle-resolved analyses, we show how cell geometry and material\nproperties critically influence the RF field distribution and coupling\nefficiency.

The method was introduced\n(in 2016) to improve on the simple additivity rule according to which\nscattering cross sections for a molecular target can be obtained by summing up\nthe cross sections of the constituent atoms. The key idea of the IAM-PCM is the\ninclusion of weight factors in the summation, to be determined from a\ngeometrical interpretation of the resultant cross section as a combined area of\noverlapping atomic contributions, which is calculated via a pixelization\ntechnique. We argue here that the IAM-PCM can be conceptualized in a different\nbut equivalent way by associating each pixel in the area decomposition with a\nscattering event. The calculation of net and charge-state correlated capture\nand ionization cross sections is explained, and results for 10 keV to 10 MeV\nproton impact are discussed for a number of targets ranging from compact\nten-electron systems to large biomolecules. A previously observed scaling\nbehaviour of the net ionization cross sections is revisited and shown to be\ncaptured by a simple parametrization with remarkable accuracy.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the\nprocess $e^+e^- \\to p\\bar{p}\\pi$ serves as a particularly promising channel as\na probe for higher isovector $\\rho$ excitations. In contrast to typical\nelectron-positron annihilation processes into purely light-meson final states,\nthe reaction $e^+e^- \\to p\\bar{p}\\pi$ benefits from a relatively low continuum\nbackground, on the order of $(50\\sim100)~\\text{pb}$ around 2.4 GeV, which\nenhances the visibility of even modest resonance contributions.

    "abstract": "The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new\npotential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking\nbudget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a\nsolution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator\nframework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model\nperiodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a\nconfident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty\nthreshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability\nby allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging\nfurther reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the\nAIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)\nimproves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended\nmulti-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing\nvariance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based\ngrading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate\nmillions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty\nthresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a\npowerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the\nreasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,\ntrustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in\ndomains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.",

While communities\nmust carefully consider appropriate and responsible LLM integration, the\nabsence of concrete norms has left individual editors to experiment and\nnavigate LLM use on their own. Understanding how LLMs influence community\nparticipation is therefore critical in shaping future norms and supporting\neffective adoption. To address this gap, we investigated Wikipedia, one of the\nlargest knowledge production communities, to understand 1) how LLMs influence\nthe ways editors contribute content, 2) what strategies editors leverage to\nalign LLM outputs with community norms, and 3) how other editors in the\ncommunity respond to LLM-assisted contributions. Through interviews with 16\nWikipedia editors who had used LLMs for their edits, we found that 1) LLMs\naffected the content contributions for experienced and new editors differently;\n2) aligning LLM outputs with community norms required tacit knowledge that\noften challenged newcomers; and 3) as a result, other editors responded to\nLLM-assisted edits differently depending on the editors' expertise level.

Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to\nevaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional\nprobe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented\nkey clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals\nto enhance LLM-based textual response generation.

These results are compared to model predictions provided by the NEUT\nv5.3.2 and GENIE v2.8.0 MC generators and the measurements are compatible with\nthese models. Differential cross sections in muon momentum and cosine of the\nmuon scattering angle are also reported.

Drawing on daily and monthly open-source\nintelligence (OSINT) data from WarSpotting, we aim to assess trends in\nattrition, evaluate model performance, and estimate future loss patterns\nthrough the end of 2025. Our findings show that deep learning models,\nparticularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially\nunder conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model\narchitectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of\nensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available\nOSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.",

    "abstract": "Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and\nlanding (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight\nregimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile\ndelivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate\nvertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the\nstop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,\npractical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and\nstability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO\n(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a\nflipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust\nvectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state\nmachine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller\nreconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and\ncontrol framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome\nlongstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,\nbidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.",

We study their respective\ncontributions to the stochastic gravitational wave background by computing\ntheir spectral densities in a radiation-dominated universe. These terms appear\nat third order in cosmological perturbation theory, however, their correlations\nwith primordial gravitational waves are non-trivial and appear at the same\norder as so-called scalar induced and scalar-tensor induced gravitational\nwaves. We find that these gravitational wave sources suppress the spectral\ndensity at the scales we consider. Furthermore, similarly to scalar-tensor\nsource terms at second order, we find that some terms are enhanced when the\ninput primordial power spectrum of scalar fluctuations is not sufficiently\npeaked. Hence, where possible, we show that under certain limits the integrands\nof these terms diverge in the UV sector.",

Its\nsimilarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good\nlocal analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We\ncharacterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity\nof the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic\nExplorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented\nspatial resolution of 0.\"15$\\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the\ncentral SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in\nan extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in\ndust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat\ntemperature distributions $T_\\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \\pm 1700$ K and\n$T_\\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \\pm 600$ K, and a structured\n$n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \\pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat\nhelium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \\pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 +\n\\log(\\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \\pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around\nthe SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The\ntotal excess nitrogen mass is $\\sim$0.3 $M_\\odot$, which we estimate is\nproducible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no\ndirect spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich\nmaterial appears to have been expelled from the original sites.",

However, inpainting\nmissing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a\nchallenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent\ngeometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach\nfor 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and\nimproved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based\nand object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately\nplaced in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a\nconsistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects\ninconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on\nthe SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing\nNeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also\nreduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers\nsharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging\nviewpoints.",

This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction\nof the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the\nstrong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666.

Moreover, the SIDM\nmodel is favored over $\\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44.

Nevertheless, existing FE schemes do\nnot support fine-grained revocation and update, so they are unsuitable for EHR\nsystem. In this paper,we first propose an inner-product functional encryption\nwith fine-grained revocation (IPFE-FR) scheme, and then apply it to a flexible\nEHR sharing system. Our scheme possesses the following features:(1) a group\nmanager can revoke a specific function computation of medical institutions on\nencrypted EHR data,instead of all function computation rights. (2) a revoked\nmedical institution is not allowed to compute the function value of encrypted\nEHR data not only generated after the revocation, but also generated before the\nrevocation. (3) secret keys issued to the same medical institution are bound\ntogether to prevent collusion attacks. The formal definition and security model\nof the IPFE-FR scheme are proposed.Furthermore, we present a concrete\nconstruction and reduce its security to the Learning with Errors (LWE)\nassumption which is quantum-resistant. Finally, the theoretical analysis and\nexperimental implementation of our scheme are conducted to show its efficiency.",

Many\nreal-world systems that exhibit tipping behavior can be represented as networks\nof interacting multistable units, such as vegetation patches or infrastructure\nnetworks, undergoing both pairwise and higher-order interactions. In this\narticle, we explore how higher-order interactions shape the dynamics of tipping\ncascades in a conceptual system with tipping points. Numerical simulations on\nrandom, scale-free, and small-world networks reveal that higher-order\ninteractions can induce cascades even at coupling strengths, where only\npairwise interactions fail to do so. We also investigate the interplay of the\npairwise and higher-order coupling strengths in random networks and illustrate\nthe route to cascades through bifurcation diagrams. These results have also\nbeen demonstrated on real-world social networks. Apart from this, we show that\nrepulsive higher-order interactions suppress tipping cascades at coupling\nstrengths where pairwise interactions would cause them, and shift the cascade\nroute from a saddle-node to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Our results\nhighlight the critical role of higher-order interactions in shaping cascade\ndynamics, offering insights for anticipating and mitigating critical\ntransitions in ecosystems, climate systems, and socio-technical\ninfrastructures.",

We develop a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model to investigate\nthe reflection and transmission of inertial waves in the presence of a\nlocalized geostrophic shear layer of arbitrary width and compare our\ntheoretical findings to a set of numerical simulations. We demonstrate that, in\ncontrast to ray theory predictions, partial reflections occur even in\nsubcritical shear layers and tunnelling with almost total transmission is\npossible in supercritical shear layers, if the layer is thin compared to the\nwavelength. That is, supercritical shear layers act as low-pass filters for\ninertial wave beams allowing the low-wavenumber waves to travel through.

    "abstract": "Modern information retrieval (IR) must bridge short, ambiguous queries and\never more diverse, rapidly evolving corpora. Query Expansion (QE) remains a key\nmechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted\nmarkedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models\n(LLMs). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a\nfour-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection\n(explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases,\nmodel-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to\nknowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning\nencoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only, instruction-tuned, and\ndomain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for\nQE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot\nreasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE\nhelps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion\nwith PLM/LLM-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications\nacross web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational\nand code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design\ngrounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG\nconstraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude\nwith an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal\nadaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy.\nCollectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and\ncombining QE techniques under real-world constraints.",

In recent years, many FANNS\nalgorithms have been proposed. However, the lack of a systematic investigation\nmakes it difficult to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.\nAdditionally, we found that: (1) FANNS algorithms have coupled,\ndataset-dependent parameters, leading to biased comparisons. (2) Key impact\nfactors are rarely analyzed systematically, leaving unclear when each algorithm\nperforms well. (3) Disparate datasets, workloads, and biased experiment designs\nmake cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable. Thus, a comprehensive survey and\nbenchmark for FANNS is crucial to achieve the following goals: designing a fair\nevaluation and clarifying the classification of algorithms, conducting in-depth\nanalysis of their performance, and establishing a unified benchmark. First, we\npropose a taxonomy (dividing methods into \\textit{filter-then-search},\n\\textit{search-then-filter}, \\textit{hybrid-search}) and a systematic\nevaluation framework, integrating unified parameter tuning and standardized\nfiltering across algorithms to reduce implementation-induced performance\nvariations and reflect core trade-offs. Then, we conduct a comprehensive\nempirical study to analyze how query difficulty and dataset properties impact\nperformance, evaluating robustness under pressures like filter selectivity,\nRecall@k, and scalability to clarify each method's strengths.

The origin of this duality remains debated, particularly\nregarding the role of elastic interactions. Here, large-scale molecular\ndynamics simulations are employed to investigate dislocation transmission\nacross various tilt LAGBs in BCC Fe. The results show that transmission\nresistance varies widely with boundary-dislocation geometry. Contrary to the\nprevailing view that dislocation reactions dominate, elastic interactions\nbetween lattice and boundary dislocations emerge as the primary controlling\nfactor. Screw and screw-like dislocations generate shear stresses that bend GB\ndislocations and produce strong barriers, whereas edge dislocations lack such\nstresses and transmit more readily. Consequently, barrier strength increases as\nthe dislocation character angle decreases, with screw dislocations experiencing\nthe strongest resistance. An analytical model is developed that quantitatively\npredicts the net transmission stress, in excellent agreement with simulations.\nThese findings establish a mechanistic framework for LAGB-dislocation\ninteractions and offer guidance for designing LAGB-strengthened materials.",

Our approach\npossesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication\ntechniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement\nback-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically\ndemonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series\nforecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway\nfor implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the\nmesoscopic physics applications.",

The main\nfocus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this\nsecond paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that\nincorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic\ncomponents. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the\ndark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster\nand galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50\"$ on\nthe multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \\& ICL, as well\nas the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately\nreproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\\mathrm{km/s}$\nscatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This\nmethod yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among\nalmost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\\sigma$ agreement between\nthe inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale\ncosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is\nconsistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the\nfirst multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark\nmatter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its\nresults, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of\neach mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological\nsimulations such as illustrisTNG.",

Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient\nand explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of\nhair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level\nhair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline\nfirst reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian\nrasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands\nthrough a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under\nphotometric supervision.\n  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the\ngeometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair\nstrands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a\nproxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient\nreconstruction, typically completing within one hour.\n  The project page can be found at: https://yimin-pan.github.io/hair-gs/",

The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in\nthe solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination\nangle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar\ndirection results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation\nlifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other\ndirections.

Since gravity provides the\nweakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of\nprimordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using\nonly a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and\nenvironment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on\nsuper-Hubble modes of {\\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in\nH/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being\nsuper-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for\nsuper-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the\n`rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be\ninapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from\nthe nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We\nidentify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part\nof the purity evolution is UV finite.

Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable\ncost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding\nwhy developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may\nsupport wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They\nenriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting\nreadability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were\npragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related\nto developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation\nwith motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs\neffectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural\nreasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when\ncombined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration\noffers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and\nbalancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.",

In\nthis first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required\nfor the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we\nmeasure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster\nmembers, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL)\nin Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light\nprofiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for\ncontamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \\textsc{Hubble\nSpace Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster\nmembers using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST\nF160W filter, while the BCG \\& ICL is modelled as a single component using a\nmulti-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions,\nwe rely on multi-band HST photometry and \\textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field\nspectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different\nspectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as\ndetermined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \\& ICL components, we\nuse elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able\nto constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second\npaper of the series. We publicly release these measurements with intermediary\ndata products.",

Because browsers\nroutinely process scripts, media, and executable code from unknown sources,\nthey form a critical security boundary between users and adversaries. A common\nattack vector is JavaScript, which exposes a large attack surface due to the\nsheer complexity of modern JavaScript engines. To mitigate these threats,\nmodern engines increasingly adopt software-based fault isolation (SFI). A\nprominent example is Google's V8 heap sandbox, which represents the most widely\ndeployed SFI mechanism, protecting billions of users across all Chromium-based\nbrowsers and countless applications built on Node$.$js and Electron. The heap\nsandbox splits the address space into two parts: one part containing trusted,\nsecurity-sensitive metadata, and a sandboxed heap containing memory accessible\nto untrusted code. On a technical level, the sandbox enforces isolation by\nremoving raw pointers and using translation tables to resolve references to\ntrusted objects. Consequently, an attacker cannot corrupt trusted data even\nwith full control of the sandboxed data, unless there is a bug in how code\nhandles data from the sandboxed heap. Despite their widespread use, such SFI\nmechanisms have seen little security testing.\n  In this work, we propose a new testing technique that models the security\nboundary of modern SFI implementations. Following the SFI threat model, we\nassume a powerful attacker who fully controls the sandbox's memory. We\nimplement this by instrumenting memory loads originating in the trusted domain\nand accessing untrusted, attacker-controlled sandbox memory.

A complementary\nuse-case is operational decision-making, where the goal is to forecast\nshort-term performance based on ongoing cases and to analyze the impact of\ntemporary disruptions, such as demand spikes and shortfalls in available\nresources. An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation\nup to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and\nmeasure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the\ncurrent state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies\nan alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation\nof the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper\naddresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a\nsimulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start\nfrom the current state of cases and resources? (2) How can the current state of\na process be derived from an event log? The resulting short-term simulation\napproach is embodied in a simulation engine that takes as input a simulation\nmodel and a log of ongoing cases, and simulates cases for a given time horizon.\nAn experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields more accurate\nshort-term performance forecasts than long-term simulations with warm-up\nperiod, particularly in the presence of concept drift or bursty performance\npatterns.",

    "abstract": "We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a\nwell-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent\nconservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for\nthe actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from\nwithin a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we\npartition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy\nexchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian\nof the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical\nminisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental\ndata that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes\nseveral cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By\ntuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus\nthe speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright\nuniverse. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation\nthat could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to\nreproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that\ntime in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges\nfrom thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental\nplatform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.",

While a direct fitting for all\nsignals is infeasible, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap\nwith other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise\nfrom the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial\nfor developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of\nbiases in single-detector cases to a detector network. Specifically, we focus\non the bias dependence on the sky location, polarization and inclination\nangles, as well as the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity,\nnamed the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between\nthe biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit\ndependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example,\nwe further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the\ndetectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location\ngenerally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only\nwhen the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a\npopulation-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly\nhalf of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared\nto a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in\na detector network.",

    "abstract": "For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be\nprohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations\nin texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial\nto develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training\ninstances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,\nwith RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for\nRE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a\nmulti-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively\ncapture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,\nalthough employing binary classification for each relation individually can\nmitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,\nresulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training\ninstances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the\nadvantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,\nRelation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its\nsuperior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled\ntexts for RE.",

We need to\nexplore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the\ncompression error affects the inference performance.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression\nalgorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby\nreducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive\nexperiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of\nhow compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference\naccuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are\nprimarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of\ninput tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in\ninference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the\nmiddle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly\nimpair inference accuracy.

With a\nV-band absolute magnitude light curve peaking at $M_{max}(V) = -16.04 \\pm 0.25$\nmag, this object is regarded as the second determined well-observed Iax\nsupernova in the intermediate luminosity range after SN 2019muj. Our research\naims to explore the question of whether the physical properties vary\ncontinuously across the entire luminosity range. We also investigate the\nchemical abundance profiles and the characteristic physical quantities of the\nejecta, followed by tests of the predictions of hydro simulations. The\npseudo-bolometric light curve was calculated using optical and UV (Swift UVOT )\nlight curves and fits with a radiation diffusion Arnett model to constrain the\naverage optical opacity, ejected mass, and initial nickel mass produced in the\nexplosion. We analyzed the color evolution of SN 2022xlp and compared it with\nthat of other Iax supernovae with different peak luminosities. We used the\nspectral tomography method to determine the radial profiles of physical\nproperties and abundances of the ejecta, comparing them with a set of\nhydrodynamic pure deflagration models. The estimated bolometric flux peaks at\n$8.87\\times 10^{41}$ erg/s and indicates the production of radioactive nickel\nas $M(^{56}$Ni) = $0.0215 \\pm 0.009\\,M_{\\odot}$. According to the best-fit\nmodel, the explosion energy is $(2.066 \\pm 0.236) \\times 10^{49}$ erg and the\nejecta mass is $0.142 \\pm 0.015\\,M_{\\odot}$. The performed spectral tomography\nanalysis shows that the determined physical quantities agree well with the\npredictions of the deflagration simulations, with modifications regarding the\nincreased Na abundance and the more massive outer layers. SN 2022xlp bridges\nthe previously existing luminosity gap, and supports the assumption of\ncontinuous variation in the physical properties across the SN Iax subclass.",

The\ndataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process\nhigh-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a\ndataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered\nby the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very\ndiverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity\nof the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts\nand missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to\nsolve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training\nand validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to\navoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical\nimage patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were\noriginally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the\ndataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide\nstatistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial\ndistribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and\nmore. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and\ncompare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,\nDepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction.

On time scales beyond a few\nrotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability\narises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction\nvariations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a\nmethodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these\ninhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this,\nwe converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the\nprobability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying\nprincipal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable\ndistribution of the first two principal components. We show that this\ndistribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated\nfingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the\ndistribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and\nobserved light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric\nuncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model\nplacement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance\namong highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset\nof significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the\nmost critical.

A recent\nprotocol (PRX Quantum 6, 020323 (2025)) combining channel concatenation and\nquantum memory has achieved an exponential reduction in measurement complexity\nfor Pauli channel estimation. This efficiency, however, hinges on using\nlogarithmic quantum memory to suppress hypothesis test errors. In this work, we\nintroduce a mechanism termed the ``weakly-driven quantum walk'' to mitigate the\ndemand for high-quality quantum memory. By exploiting the distinct dynamical\nproperties of quantum walks under biased versus unbiased driving, our algorithm\nlowers the quantum memory overhead to a constant order while preserving the\nexponential advantage in measurement complexity. By analogy with weak\nmeasurement, our introduced concept of ``weak driving'' preserves pointer\ncoherence even when driven by classical probabilistic information, a principle\nthat may inspire new approaches to similar quantum algorithm design and quantum\nsensing of weak signals in resource-constrained scenarios.",

As is the case for other models explored for this task, it\ncan be applied to specific geometries, however its true strength lies in its\ngeneralisation capabilities. Our approach allows pre-training on multiple\ndetectors and rapid adaptation to new ones, which we demonstrate on the LEMURS\ndataset. It reduces the effort required to develop accurate models for novel\ndetectors or detectors which are under development and have geometries that are\nchanged frequently, requiring up to 25x less data and 20x less training time.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first pre-trained model to be\npublished that allows adaptation in the context of particle shower simulations,\nwith the model also included in the Geant4 toolkit. We also present results on\nbenchmarks on Dataset-2 from the community-hosted CaloChallenge, showing that\nour models provide one of the best tradeoffs between accuracy and speed from\nthe published models.

The presence\nof such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations\nand high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between\nobservation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations\ncan be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our\nunderstanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we\nshowed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy\nformation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and\nhighest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its\npublication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been\ndiscovered by JWST, in particular the \"Mirage-or-Miracle\" (MoM) survey broke\nthe record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a\nspectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.44$ followed closely by\nGS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.3$. We\ninvestigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in\nconflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing\ntension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift\nastrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be\nexplained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high\nstellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous\nmeasurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical\nmodels (even after accounting for cosmic variance).",

Using high-speed particle image velocimetry at up to 2000\nHz, we isolate and track the primary vortex shed during exit. The body motion\nis driven by constant vertical acceleration from rest, such that the cylinder\nkinematics satisfy $v_{cyl}^2$ = $2$$\\alpha$$\\Delta$$y_{cyl}$, with $\\Delta$\n$y_{cyl}$ the displacement since release. This controlled protocol allows\nsystematic variation of the acceleration alpha while keeping the maximum\ncrossing velocity fixed.

The\nresults show that circulation growth collapses under the impulse-based scaling\n$\\Gamma / \\sqrt(\\alpha(\\Delta y_{cyl})^3)$, independent of the imposed\nacceleration.

    "abstract": "Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due\nto ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning\n(SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By\npre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn\nrobust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various\nscience-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL\napproach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a\nrelevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent\nrepresentations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven\nrepresentations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and\nsubsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.",

    "abstract": "We present the Physics-Informed Low-Rank Neural Operator (PILNO), a neural\noperator framework for efficiently approximating solution operators of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) on point cloud data. PILNO combines low-rank\nkernel approximations with an encoder--decoder architecture, enabling fast,\ncontinuous one-shot predictions while remaining independent of specific\ndiscretizations. The model is trained using a physics-informed penalty\nframework, ensuring that PDE constraints and boundary conditions are satisfied\nin both supervised and unsupervised settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness\non diverse problems, including function fitting, the Poisson equation, the\nscreened Poisson equation with variable coefficients, and parameterized Darcy\nflow. The low-rank structure provides computational efficiency in\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces, establishing PILNO as a scalable and\nflexible surrogate modeling tool for PDEs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we theoretically investigate the deflection of light, lensing\nequations, topological properties of photon rings, and accretion disk\ncharacteristics in the spacetime of a holonomy-corrected Schwarzschild black\nhole surrounded by a cloud of strings. The analysis is carried out in the\nweak-field limit, where we analytically derive expressions for the deflection\nangle and extract the corresponding lensing observables. These results reveal\nthe dependence of light deflection on the string cloud parameter and the\nholonomy correction parameter, offering potential observational signatures of\nunderlying quantum gravity effects. We model possible gravitational scenarios\nto explore the distinguishing features of this modified BH geometry and assess\nits deviation from classical solutions through gravitational lensing behavior.\nFurthermore, we analyze the topological structure of the photon sphere by\nconstructing a normalized vector field and demonstrate how it is affected by\nthe presence of string clouds and holonomy corrections. Finally, we examine the\nproperties of a thin accretion disk in this BH background, showing that both\nthe string cloud and holonomy parameters significantly influence the disk's\nradiation profile, temperature distribution, and spectral characteristics. Our\nresults suggest that these modifications leave measurable imprints, providing\nviable avenues for observational constraints in the strong-gravity regime.",

Subsequent\nobservations, including late-time spectra with JWST, have highlighted the need\nfor accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic\nlevel populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha\nrelations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular\nphase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore\nrequires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that\naffect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact\nexcitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two\ncomputational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within\nthe pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using\nAUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference\nR-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their\nsuitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition,\nradiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results\nprovide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute\natomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the motion of spinning particles around a\ncovariant quantum-corrected black hole without a Cauchy horizon within the\nframework of effective quantum gravity, and examine the influence of quantum\ngravitational effects on the motion of these spinning particles. First, we\nemploy the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations to derive the 4-momentum and\n4-velocity of spinning particles, and introduce the effective potential for\nradial motion using the components of the 4-momentum. We find that an increase\nin the quantum parameter $\\zeta$ leads to a decrease in the effective\npotential, while the spin $S$ significantly affects the magnitude of the\neffective potential. Then, through the effective potential, we investigate the\nproperties of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, and\ndiscuss the timelike condition that spinning particles must satisfy when moving\naround the black hole. Finally, we study the trajectories of spinning particles\non bound orbits around the quantum-corrected black hole and compare them with\nthose around other covariant quantum-corrected black holes. The results show\nthat the trajectories of spinning particles in this quantum-corrected black\nhole model are weakly influenced by $\\zeta$, making them almost\nindistinguishable from those in the Schwarzschild black hole, but they can be\ndistinguished from other covariant quantum-corrected models under certain\ninitial conditions. These results contribute to our understanding of black hole\nproperties under quantum corrections.",

    "abstract": "Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional\ndatasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data\nvisualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle\nvery large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions\nhave been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as\nin UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted\nstructures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer\nbetter structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the\ntarget dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some\nvariants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables\nfiner-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated\nhyperparameters.\n  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing\na novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per\niteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and\nflexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality\nof the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of\ndata; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE\nmethods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,\neven when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the\ncomputations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI\nintegration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility\nin the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine\nlearning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this\nalgorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour\nsearch, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.",

In order to address this issue, we conducted a\ndetailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and\nmagnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic\nfield-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive\ndilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the\nunit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments\ninvolving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the\nCo-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of\noutermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects\nare the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed\nanalysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose\nthat the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the\nligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the\ndielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic,\nelastic and dielectric properties in this material.",

We integrated the orbit of\n3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars\nwith high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages\nwithin 2 pc. We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at\nthe $2\\sigma$ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful\nperturbation. The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc\nand with a relative velocity of 35 km s$^{-1}$, imparted only a velocity change\nof $|\\Delta v| \\simeq 5\\times10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our\nresults indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc\ncontained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be\nassociated with its origin.

Despite their improvements using deep learning, they\nface severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and\nadversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates\ndetection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.\nWhile anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many\nrely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial\nmethods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we\npropose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method\nthat strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated\naudio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA\ncreates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We\nconducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.\nSMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against\ncombined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification\nsystems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively\ndemonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive\nadversarial attacks.

To address these issues, we propose\nFeedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user\nfeedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response\nregeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing\nerror propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally\ncorrect outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,\nwhich enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through\ndelayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making\ncharacteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on\nmathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our\nframework achieves consistent and significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic\npotentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates\nthat chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced\nenantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion\nin a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital\nselectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral\npotential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's\nlinear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly\nstronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions\nunder realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to\nincrease with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static\ndisorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when\ninitial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings\nunderscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron\ntransport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role\nalongside existing spin-based mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.\nIn particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a\nparticular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.\nBehaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of\nrobots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is\nwhether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering\n\"why\" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior\nattention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual\nexplanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.\nTherefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically\ngenerates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive \"why\"\nquestions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal\nmodel from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge\nabout the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model\nis then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual\nexplanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the\nbehaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being\nable to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step\ntowards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image\nclassification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard\nadversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly\naddress inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial\nsusceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training\nframework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out\ninter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature\nspace. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class\nneighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto\nthese neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant\nof neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly\ncontributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments\nacross standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that\nour method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading\nadversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both\nrobust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing\ninter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in\nDNNs.",

The spatial distribution of the\ncataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk,\nincluding coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more\ndetailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our\nunderstanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and\nprovide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble.

To\naccess these exotic phases and induce new ones, it is necessary to control and\ntune the energies of the electronic states of those heterostructures. In this\nwork we investigate the engineering of the band structure of the\ntwo-dimensional Bi/Si(111) $\\beta$-phase using a modulation doping approach\nbased on boron segregation at the surface. We demonstrate that the Bi-induced\nRashba bands can be displaced in energy by up to 200 meV without altering their\nstrong Rashba parameter. Importantly, while the Bi states shift upward, the\nunderlying Si valence states remain essentially fixed, which rules out a simple\nband-bending scenario. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that\nthe displacement originates from changes in the hybridization of Si states near\nthe surface, induced by the presence of B atoms. This selective mechanism\nhalves the distance of the Rashba-split states from the Fermi level, opening\nthe way to their exploitation in transport and spintronic devices and\nhighlighting the broader potential of modulation doping as a band-engineering\nstrategy for two-dimensional metals on semiconductors.",

DeepGraphLog enables\nmulti-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components\nto be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot\nhandle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic\nrepresentations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in\nplanning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN\nexpressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures\ncomplex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements are critical for future neutrino\noscillation analyses. However, our models to describe them require further\nrefinement, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential\nfor future neutrino oscillation experiments to realize their ambitious physics\ngoals. Current neutrino cross-section measurements provide clear deficiencies\nin neutrino interaction modeling, but almost all are reported averaged over\nbroad neutrino fluxes, rendering their interpretation challenging. Using the\nDUNE-PRISM concept (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment Precision Reaction\nIndependent Spectrum Measurement) -- a movable near detector that samples\nmultiple off-axis positions -- neutrino interaction measurements can be used to\nconstruct narrow virtual fluxes (less than 100 MeV wide). These fluxes can be\nused to extract charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections as functions of\noutgoing lepton kinematics within specific neutrino energy ranges. Based on a\ndedicated simulation with realistic event statistics and flux-related\nsystematic uncertainties, but assuming an almost-perfect detector, we run a\nfeasibility study demonstrating how DUNE-PRISM data can be used to measure muon\nneutrino charged-current integrated and differential cross sections over narrow\nfluxes. We find that this approach enables a model independent reconstruction\nof powerful observables, including energy transfer, typically accessible only\nin electron scattering measurements, but that large exposures may be required\nfor differential cross-section measurements with few-\\% statistical\nuncertainties.",

    "abstract": "For an ample groupoid with torsion-free stabilizers, we construct a Chern\ncharacter map going from the domain of the Baum-Connes assembly map of G to the\ngroupoid homology groups of G with rational coefficients. As a main\napplication, assuming the (rational) Baum-Connes conjecture, we prove the\nrational form of Matui's HK conjecture, i.e., we show that the operator\nK-groups of the groupoid C*-algebra are rationally isomorphic to the\nperiodicized groupoid homology groups. Our construction hinges on the recent\n$\\infty$-categorical viewpoint on bivariant K-theory, and does not rely on\ntypical noncommutative geometry tools such as the Chern-Connes character and\nthe periodic cyclic homology of smooth algebras. We also present applications\nto the homology of hyperbolic dynamical systems, the homology of topological\nfull groups, the homotopy type of the algebraic K-theory spectrum of ample\ngroupoids, and the Elliott invariant of classifiable C*-algebras.",

To address\nthis, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),\nwhich employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.\nThis design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth\ndisparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an\nAdaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion\naggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into\nsparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages\nglobal-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further\nenhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet\nreduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,\nrespectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art\nmethod. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves\nPSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs.

    "abstract": "The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the\nsystem of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective\nenvironment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of\nquantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms,\nsuperconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common\napproach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches\nbased on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are\nindeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread\napplication of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by\naccuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases,\nsuch as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is\nstructured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes\nof the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation\nof information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real\nproblems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as\nit is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be\npractical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of\ntechniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the\nnotion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process\ntensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door\nto the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a\nwide range of open quantum systems.",

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely\non target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in\ncomplex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and\nbackground discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video\nbackgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable\npriors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and\nsparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the\nbackground, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on\nthese insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires\nminimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a\ntokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank\npriors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local\nand non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying\non explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse\ncomponent update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to\nenhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared\nsmall target detection and space object detection.

To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary\nmethod used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing\nreflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is\nthe high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a\nhigh-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to\naddress these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy,\nand high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the\ndetectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using\nrealistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis\nmethodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting\nrealistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of\nthe AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects\nthrough the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology\nto isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit\nseveral planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced\na method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which\nconstrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming\nan Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b\nin reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to\ncharacterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo.\nIn addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about\n85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO\nto significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling\nreflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of what we term ``fast good codes'' with ``fast good\nduals.'' Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a binary linear\ncode $C \\leq \\mathcal{F}_2^n$ such that both it and its dual $C^\\perp :=\\{x \\in\n\\mathcal{F}_2^n:\\forall c \\in C, \\langle x,c\\rangle=0\\}$ are asymptotically\ngood (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are\nencodable in $O(n)$ time. While we believe such codes should find applications\nmore broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure\ncomputation task of encrypted matrix-vector product, as studied by Behhamouda\net al (CCS 2025, to appear).\n  Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast\ngood dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA)\ncodes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2\ncode, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps --\nwhere first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the\nprefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative\nsteps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and\nafterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these\ntwo operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code\nis very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed.\n  Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA codes due to Ravazzi and\nFagnani (IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2009). The main idea is to bound the\ninput-output weight-enumerator function: the expected number of messages of a\ngiven weight that are encoded into a codeword of a given weight. We face new\nchallenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative matrix\n(which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by\ncareful case analysis.",

Following this, we analyze the thermal transport\nproperties of the alloy under the constant relaxation time approximation, which\nallows us to gain insights into its thermoelectric performance. Our\ncalculations reveal a substantial Seebeck voltage and thermopower, with notably\nhigher values for P-type doping than N-type doping. This finding highlights the\nenhanced thermoelectric performance of P-type carriers in this material,\nproviding a starting point for experimentalists to utilize this alloy for real\ndevice applications.",

It is challenging to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase due to the\nvolatile nature of bismuth and the very narrow temperature range for forming\nthis phase. So, this work aims to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase at lower\nannealing temperatures using an efficient sol-gel method. We have chosen the\nannealing temperature from 450 to 650 C, and a detailed analysis of structural\nand optical properties is performed here. X-ray diffraction is used to confirm\nthe crystalline nature of the material. Single-phase Rietveld analysis of XRD\npatterns is carried out to study the effect of annealing temperature on\nstructural parameters. All the samples are crystalized in pure rhombohedral\nBiFeO3 phase with the R3c space group symmetry, except those annealed at higher\ntemperatures, 600 C and 650 C. Strain and dislocation densities were decreasing\nwith an increase in the annealing temperature. From the UV-visible analysis, a\nstrong response is observed below 600 nm in the visible region, and the band\ngap from the absorption behaviour is estimated in the range of 2.26 - 2.60 eV\nfor these Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared analysis\nconfirmed the existence of metal-oxygen bonds in Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles.\nThese nanoparticles were found to be thermally stable from the thermal analysis\nperformed using differential scanning calorimetry.

    "abstract": "Microcontroller units (MCUs) are widely used in embedded devices due to their\nlow power consumption and cost-effectiveness. MCU firmware controls these\ndevices and is vital to the security of embedded systems. However, performing\ndynamic security analyses for MCU firmware has remained challenging due to the\nlack of usable execution environments -- existing dynamic analyses cannot run\non physical devices (e.g., insufficient computational resources), while\nbuilding emulators is costly due to the massive amount of heterogeneous\nhardware, especially peripherals.\n  Our work is based on the insight that MCU peripherals can be modeled in a\ntwo-fold manner. At the structural level, peripherals have diverse\nimplementations but we can use a limited set of primitives to abstract\nperipherals because their hardware implementations are based on common hardware\nconcepts. At the semantic level, peripherals have diverse functionalities.\nHowever, we can use a single unified semantic model to describe the same kind\nof peripherals because they exhibit similar functionalities. Building on this,\nwe propose FlexEmu, a flexible MCU peripheral emulation framework. Once\nsemantic models are created, FlexEmu automatically extracts peripheral-specific\ndetails to instantiate models and generate emulators accordingly. We have\nsuccessfully applied FlexEmu to model 12 kinds of MCU peripherals. Our\nevaluation on 90 firmware samples across 15 different MCU platforms shows that\nthe automatically generated emulators can faithfully replicate hardware\nbehaviors and achieve a 98.48% unit test passing rate, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the implications of FlexEmu on\nfirmware security, we use the generated emulators to fuzz three popular RTOSes\nand uncover 10 previously unknown bugs.",

Moreover, most existing\nmodels are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D\nimage-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their\neffectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of\nstructural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient\nfine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate\nits application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.

We present analysis of\nBalmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars\n(FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width,\nand apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar\nspectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into\naccount, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated\ncorrelation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this\nsample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds\ncharacterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H.

Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density\nwith respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and\nEddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in\nthe lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with\n{\\alpha}oi, the F{\\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns.\nThis parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among\nlow-redshift quasars (K.

However, their expressiveness has been insufficient for\ntracking capabilities embedded in generic data structures, preventing them from\nscaling to the standard collections library -- an essential prerequisite for\nbroader adoption. This limitation stems from the inability to name capabilities\nwithin the system's notion of box types.\n  This paper develops System Capless, a new foundation for capturing types that\nprovides the theoretical basis for reach capabilities (rcaps), a novel\nmechanism for naming \"what's in the box.\" The calculus refines the universal\ncapability notion into a new scheme with existential and universal capture set\nquantification. Intuitively, rcaps witness existentially quantified capture\nsets inside the boxes of generic types in a way that does not require exposing\nexistential capture types in the surface language. We have fully mechanized the\nformal metatheory of System Capless in Lean, including proofs of type soundness\nand scope safety. System Capless supports the same lightweight notation of\ncapturing types plus rcaps, as certified by a type-preserving translation, and\nalso enables fully optional explicit capture-set quantification to increase\nexpressiveness.\n  Finally, we present a full reimplementation of capture checking in Scala 3\nbased on System Capless and migrate the entire Scala collections library and an\nasynchronous programming library to evaluate its practicality and ergonomics.\nOur results demonstrate that reach capabilities enable the adoption of capture\nchecking in production code with minimal changes and minimal-to-zero notational\noverhead in a vast majority of cases.",

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable\nguidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into\nclassifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.",

Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic\nlimits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the\nlow-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts.\nUsing a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of\nlinear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We\ndemonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of\nlinearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the\ntheory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian\nElectric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics\nare frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by\nthe matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent\ndynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which\ngoverns gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is\nsourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining\nCarrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics\nin ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the\nstudy of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic\nprinciple.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the second frequency moment $F_2$ of a data stream up to a $(1 \\pm\n\\varepsilon)$ factor is a central problem in the streaming literature. For\nerrors $\\varepsilon > \\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$, the tight bound\n$\\Theta\\left(\\log(\\varepsilon^2 n)/\\varepsilon^2\\right)$ was recently\nestablished by Braverman and Zamir. In this work, we complete the picture by\nresolving the remaining regime of small error, $\\varepsilon < 1/\\sqrt{n}$,\nshowing that the optimal space complexity is $\\Theta\\left( \\min\\left(n,\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2} \\right) \\cdot \\left(1 + \\left| \\log(\\varepsilon^2 n)\n\\right| \\right) \\right)$ bits for all $\\varepsilon \\geq 1/n^2$, assuming a\nsufficiently large universe. This closes the gap between the best known\n$\\Omega(n)$ lower bound and the straightforward $O(n \\log n)$ upper bound in\nthat range, and shows that essentially storing the entire stream is necessary\nfor high-precision estimation.\n  To derive this bound, we fully characterize the two-party communication\ncomplexity of estimating the size of a set intersection up to an arbitrary\nadditive error $\\varepsilon n$. In particular, we prove a tight $\\Omega(n \\log\nn)$ lower bound for one-way communication protocols when $\\varepsilon <\nn^{-1/2-\\Omega(1)}$, in contrast to classical $O(n)$-bit protocols that use\ntwo-way communication. Motivated by this separation, we present a two-pass\nstreaming algorithm that computes the exact histogram of a stream with high\nprobability using only $O(n \\log \\log n)$ bits of space, in contrast to the\n$\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bits required in one pass even to approximate $F_2$ with\nsmall error. This yields the first asymptotic separation between one-pass and\n$O(1)$-passes space complexity for small frequency moment estimation.",

However, as these benchmarks often contain\nspurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects\nand backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do\nspurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we\nsystematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks\n(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact\non bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such\nas masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically\nalter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in\nCLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model\nresponses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their\nreliability.

In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models\nand pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency.

In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but\nsimultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which\ncontains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level\nrepresentation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to\nform the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling\nand textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency.\nWe then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on\nboth the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla\nnetwork takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable\nperformance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic.

    "abstract": "An important thread in the study of data-stream algorithms focuses on\nsettings where stream items are active only for a limited time. We introduce a\nnew expiration model, where each item arrives with its own expiration time. The\nspecial case where items expire in the order that they arrive, which we call\nconsistent expirations, contains the classical sliding-window model of Datar,\nGionis, Indyk, and Motwani [SICOMP 2002] and its timestamp-based variant of\nBraverman and Ostrovsky [FOCS 2007].\n  Our first set of results presents algorithms (in the expiration streaming\nmodel) for several fundamental problems, including approximate counting,\nuniform sampling, and weighted sampling by efficiently tracking active items\nwithout explicitly storing them all. Naturally, these algorithms have many\nimmediate applications to other problems.\n  Our second and main set of results designs algorithms (in the expiration\nstreaming model) for the diameter and $k$-center problems, where items are\npoints in a metric space. Our results significantly extend those known for the\nspecial case of sliding-window streams by Cohen-Addad, Schwiegelshohn, and\nSohler [ICALP 2016], including also a strictly better approximation factor for\nthe diameter in the important special case of high-dimensional Euclidean space.\nWe develop new decomposition and coordination techniques along with a geometric\ndominance framework, to filter out redundant points based on both temporal and\nspatial proximity.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks\nin fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of\nthese models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and\naccountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this\npaper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to\naddress this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT\nimages, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention\nconvolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention\nrollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean\ncurvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in\ncombination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed\nedges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also\nyielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based\nexplanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose\noptimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and\ndistance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase\nwith 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.\nThe CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps\ncan enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While\ndemonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based\nclassification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent\nand competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complexity of quantum states and circuits is a central\nchallenge in quantum information science, with broad implications in many-body\nphysics, high-energy physics and quantum learning theory. A common way to model\nthe behaviour of typical states and circuits involves sampling unitary\ntransformations from the Haar measure on the unitary group. In this work, we\ndepart from this standard approach and instead study structured unitaries drawn\nfrom other compact connected groups, namely the symplectic and special\northogonal groups. By leveraging the concentration of measure phenomenon, we\nestablish two main results. We show that random quantum states generated using\nsymplectic or orthogonal unitaries typically exhibit an exponentially large\nstrong state complexity, and are nearly orthogonal to one another. Similar\nbehavior is observed for designs over these groups. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the average-case hardness of learning circuits composed of gates\ndrawn from such classical groups of unitaries. Taken together, our results\ndemonstrate that structured subgroups can exhibit a complexity comparable to\nthat of the full unitary group.",

The\ncelebrated Rashevskii-Chow theorem states that, provided the vector fields\n$\\{f_1,\\dots,f_\\nu\\}$, together with their iterated Lie brackets, span the\nwhole tangent space at some $x_*\\in\\mathcal{M}$, then any $x$ in a neighborhood\nof $x_*$ can be connected to $x_*$ by means of a finite concatenation of\nintegral curves of $\\{\\pm f_1,\\dots,\\pm f_\\nu\\}$.

The early observation\ncapability of UVOT has allowed us to identify very early flares in 21 GRBs\npreceding the normal decay or bump, consistent with predictions of external\nreverse or internal shock. The decay indices of optical LCs following a simple\npower-law (PL) are shallower than corresponding X-ray LCs, indicative of a\nspectral break between two wavelengths. Not all LCs with PL decay align with\nthe forward shock model and require additional components such as energy\ninjection or a structured jet. Further, plateaus in the optical LCs are\nprimarily consistent with energy injection from the central engine to the\nexternal medium. However, in four cases, plateaus followed by steep decay may\nhave an internal origin. The optical luminosity observed during the plateau is\ntightly correlated with the break time, indicative of a magnetar as their\npossible central engine. For LCs with early bumps, the peak position,\ncorrelations between the parameters, and observed achromaticity allowed us to\nconstrain their origin as the onset of afterglow, off-axis jet, late\nre-brightening, etc. In conclusion, the ensemble of observed features is\nexplained through diverse physical mechanisms or emissions observed from\ndifferent outflow locations and, in turn, diversity among possible progenitors.",

    "abstract": "In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in\nlarge language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a\ncost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying\nparameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple\nknowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the\nissue of \"edit skipping\", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in\ninference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of\nknowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity\nof LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing\nmethod with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single\nedited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that\nIRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.",

The Stewartson layer, identified by an elongated circulation in mean\nvertical velocity plots, emerges near the inner and outer cylinders only beyond\na critical gravitational forcing. Quantitative analyses confirm that the layer\nthickness scales as $\\delta_{st}\\sim Ek^{1/3}$ due to rotational effects,\nconsistent with results from rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection, where $Ek$\nrepresents the Ekman number. The internal circulation strength, however, is\ndetermined by both gravitational buoyancy and rotational effects. We propose\nthat gravitational buoyancy drives the internal flow, which balances against\nviscous forces to establish a terminal velocity. Through theoretical analysis,\nthe vertical velocity amplitude follows $W_{st}\\sim\nEk^{5/3}Ro^{-1}Ra_gPr^{-1}$, showing good agreement with simulation results\nacross a wide parameter range. Here, $Ro^{-1}$ represents the inverse Rossby\nnumber, $Ra_g$ the gravitational Rayleigh number, and $Pr$ the Prandtl number.\nThe theoretical predictions match simulations well, demonstrating that the\nStewartson layer is gravity-induced and rotationally constrained through\ngeostrophic balance in the CC system.

It supports two types of regenerative payload,\non-board gNB and on-board gNB-Distributed Unit (gNB-DU). Measurement results\nbased on our prototype implementation show that the on-board gNB offers lower\nlatency, while the on-board gNB-DU is more cost-effective, and there is often a\ntrade-off between Quality-of-Service (QoS) and operational expenditure (OPEX)\nwhen choosing between the two payload types.

This rigidity can lead to resource waste or\npoor user experiences. In this paper, we propose Flexible SAN (FlexSAN), an\nadaptive satellite access network architecture that dynamically configures the\noptimal regenerative payload based on real-time user demands. FlexSAN selects\nthe lowest OPEX payload configuration when all user demands are satisfied, and\notherwise maximizes the number of admitted users while ensuring QoS for\nconnected users. To address the computational complexity of dynamic payload\nselection, we design an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm.

To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is\nreformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator,\nyielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some\npoints. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in\nthe ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions\nto smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by\nutilizing the explicit form of the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a\nstatistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal\ntarget set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert\ndemonstrations.

The von Karman constant is found to remain\ninvariant within experimental uncertainty, while the additive coefficient\ndecreases with both the local APG and PG history, potentially explaining\nreported variability in logarithmic scalings across the APG TBL literature. The\nfacility enables manual prescription of APGs along the full test section,\nallowing weak PG history perturbations to be followed by extended recovery\nregions, while maintaining matched local PG and Re_tau at downstream\nmeasurement locations. This experimental configuration allows for systematic\ndecoupling of the effects of Re_tau, local PGs, and PG history, enabling\nassessment of their individual contributions to single-point turbulence\nstatistics and energy spectra across different TBL regions.

The results demonstrate the\nbenefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification\naccuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,\nleading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision\npatterns.

VFCs encode precise code\nchanges, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset\nconstruction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore\ncritical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on sparse, often\nnoisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the\nvulnerability descriptions. To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a\nnovel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links\nbetween vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates\nembeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing\ndetailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated\nmessages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap\nbetween natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach\nPatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the\nbest-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended\nevaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.\nAblation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the\nselection of backbone LLMs make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker.

Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our\nmethod reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,\nallowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\nproduces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various\nglossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to\nbaseline approaches.",

While score-based and Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge-based models require careful selection of the stochastic differential\nequation to derive the corresponding schedules, flow-based models address this\nissue via vector field matching. However, this strategy often leads to\nhallucination artifacts and inefficient training and inference processes due to\nthe potential inclusion of stochastic components in the vector field.\nAdditionally, the widely adopted diffusion backbone, NCSN++, suffers from high\ncomputational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\ntarget-based generative framework that enhances both the flexibility of\nmean/variance schedule design and the efficiency of training and inference\nprocesses. Specifically, we eliminate the stochastic components in the training\nloss by reformulating the generative speech enhancement task as a target signal\nestimation problem, which therefore leads to more stable and efficient training\nand inference processes. In addition, we employ a logistic mean schedule and a\nbridge variance schedule, which yield a more favorable signal-to-noise ratio\ntrajectory compared to several widely used schedules and thus leads to a more\nefficient perturbation strategy.

There is an unknown state of the world that\ninfluences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal\ninformation about the state to all agents. The agents update their\npreconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose\nalgorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various\naspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we\nshow that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class\nof range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We\nprovide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of\npreconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a\npolynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S. This\ngeneralizes, e.g., instances with a constant number of states and/or agents, or\ninstances with a logarithmic number of ranges.

Its practical realization\npresents several technical challenges, including the storage of quantum states\nin quantum memory and the execution of coherent quantum operations on multiple\ncopies of states within the quantum memory. In this work, we present an\nentanglement purification protocol via quantum communication, namely a\ncarrier-assisted entanglement purification protocol, which utilizes two\nelements only: i) quantum memory for a single-copy entangled state shared by\nparties and ii) single qubits travelling between parties. We show that the\nprotocol, when single-qubit transmission is noiseless, can purify a noisy\nentangled state shared by parties. When single-qubit transmission is noisy, the\npurification relies on types of noisy qubit channels; we characterize qubit\nchannels such that the protocol works for the purification. We resolve the\nlimitation by applying multiple qubits over noisy channels, and show that the\npurification protocol with multi-carrier qubits works through a noisy qubit\nchannel in general, provided that the channels are not entanglement-breaking,\ni.e., channels that cannot be constructed as measure-and-prepare operations.\nOur results significantly reduce the experimental overhead needed for\ndistilling entanglement, such as quantum memory and coherent operations, making\nlong-distance pure entanglement closer to a practical realization.",

At LHC energies, the well established suppression of charmonium\nyield from color screening in the QGP is counterbalanced by the recombination\nof uncorrelated charm-quark pairs, either throughout the QGP phase or solely at\nthe phase boundary. Systematic measurements of charmonium ground and excited\nstates are important to discriminate between the scenarios forseen by various\ntheoretical models. In addition, studies of non-prompt charmonia, i.e.,\ncharmonia originating from the decay of beauty hadrons, give access to study\nthe energy loss of beauty quarks in the QGP.

    "abstract": "Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal\nharmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface\ninclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality\nmeshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open\nquestion. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating\nthe harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base\ndomains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional\nsampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis\nfunctions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or\ngeneration. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality\ndiscretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical\nsimulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent\nthis issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for\nresampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an\nequalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear\ndiffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,\nthereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on\nsurfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent\nspheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial\nimprovement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike\ntraditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach\npreserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We\ndiscuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D\nmicrostructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their\nfuture applications.",

To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna\npositions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during\nthe whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an\noptimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of\nthe ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and\ntime-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve\nthe resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual\ntransformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective\nfunction into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block\ncoordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV\nand AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nproposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the\nachievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing\nan efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO\nsatellite communication networks.",

However, relying solely on 2D boxes\nintroduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to\nmultiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single\nviewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,\na novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data\nto address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point\nclouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as\npossible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher\nnetwork learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally\naggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality\npseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for\nboth static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view\n2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all\navailable 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets\ndemonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly\nsupervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully\nsupervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \\footnote{Code\navailable upon acceptance} Our code is available in our public repository\n(\\href{https://github.com/CEA-LIST/MVAT}{code}).",

Efficient kernels are\ncrucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet\nattaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.\nCompiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial\nmanual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using\nLLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on\ntranslating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we\nintroduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel\noptimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA\nimplementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving\nLLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,\nspecialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,\nprofiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and\nhigh-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of\n1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study\nfurther demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,\noptimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast\nmath operations to yield substantial performance gains.

    "abstract": "Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception,\nrequiring simultaneous capture of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise\nlayout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic).\nExisting methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these\nrequirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and\nsemantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall,\nOmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously\ncaptures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining\nreal-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level,\nOmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that\ncombines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation\nlevel, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and\nintroduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and\nexposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal\nconstraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.\nExtensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering\nfidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is\nfurther evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including\nmulti-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,\nand map-assisted navigation.",

Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the\nexplicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we\nrefer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the\nprobability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high\nrating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both\nthe implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of\nthe predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would\nnot have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if\nexposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our\nmodel, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization\nbounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that\noptimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling\ndistribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In\nexperiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite\nrelying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional\ninterpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of\neach possible rating.",

In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that\noptimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different\ncomputational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate\nautonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a\nRaft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized\narchitecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant\ncoordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of\nmulti-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within\nmodern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service\nplacements while maintaining high fault tolerance.

Recently, researchers\nachieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable\nstructure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and\ncompactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains\nchallenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling\nflexible arms.

Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable\naerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping\nability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,\nwe propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm\nand a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to\nremain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.\nWe also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation\nwhile integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing\ninteraction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the\nstructural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify\nsufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control\nremain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype\ndemonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well\nas the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions\nduring flight.

Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model\nvulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.\nAlthough current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or\ndirectly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic\nfeatures and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,\ntheir reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to\ngradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example\nquality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and\npropose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we\npresent a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent\ninputs.

Second, we adapt the logit loss from\ntargeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing\nproblem of cross-entropy loss.

Despite their success, LLM-based\nmethods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.\n(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window\nstrategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the\nnumber of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or\nselection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and\nincrease input-order sensitivity.

MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes\nquery-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced\nby external biases.

To automate this process, we propose a novel method that\nintegrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models\nfor vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural\nrepresentations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent\nproperties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,\nwhich effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and\ndiffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video\nscore distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained\ntext-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to\nmatch the representations resulting in smooth animation.

To address this limitation, we\nintroduce the differentiable Kalman filter (DKF), an adjoint-based two-level\noptimization framework designed to reduce the mismatch between approximate and\ntrue dynamics. Within this framework, a field inversion step first uncovers the\ndiscrepancy, after which a closure model is trained to capture the discovered\ndynamics, allowing the filter to adapt flexibly and scale efficiently. We\nillustrate the capabilities of the DKF using two representative examples: a\nrocket dynamics model and the Allen-Cahn boundary value problem. In both cases,\nand across a range of noise levels, the DKF consistently reduces state\nreconstruction error by at least 90% compared to the classical Kalman filter,\nwhile also maintaining robust uncertainty quantification.

We find a strong dependence of the results on the\natomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and\nat half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes\nplace at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the\ncavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation\nin the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly\nnon-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects\nof cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized\nstable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the\npresence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having\ndifferent effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region\narises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations.\nThe presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower\nfilling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states\ndrastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the\ncoupled atoms-cavity system.",

Despite many\nproposed indicators, a general quantification of symmetry breaking that is\nfaithful, computable, and valid in the thermodynamic limit has remained\nelusive. Here, within quantum resource theory, we propose the quantum Fisher\ninformation (QFI) as such a measure. We demonstrate its utility by computing\nQFI for paradigmatic models: in the BCS superconductor, the QFI counts the\nnumber of Cooper pairs; in the transverse-field XY spin chains, it captures\ntopological phase transition that has no local order parameter; and in quantum\nquench dynamics, it allows us to exactly derive the microscopic origin and\nconditions of the quantum Mpemba effect in terms of excitation propagation,\nincluding in the thermodynamic limit--beyond the reach of previous analyses.\nOur results show that the QFI, which is a complete resource monotone in the\nresource theory of asymmetry that plays the role of entanglement entropy in\nentanglement theory, faithfully captures symmetry breaking in condensed-matter\nsystems. These results highlight the QFI as a universal and physically\nmeaningful diagnostic of symmetry breaking in both equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while\nbalancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by\nthe unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and\nperception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving\nuncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners\ndegrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter\nserious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected\nmaneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency\ntrajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered\nonline learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies\nmulti-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)\nincrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier\nconstraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory\nprediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory\noptimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the\nuncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without\nresorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and\nurban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while\nmaintaining safety under uncertainty.

The derived\nredshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected\nfrom, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR\nemission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of\n`fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our\nforeground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated\nstellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For\nsub-samples with median stellar masses of $\\log_{10}(M_* / M_\\odot) =\n[9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$,\nrespectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck\n$N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\\log_{10}(M_* /\nM_\\odot) \\approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins.

Consequently, MESAs are least robust to\nsensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor.\nMultifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the\nproblem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array\ncontains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple\ntimes.

However, current approaches (e.g.,\nsocial assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while\noverlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human\ncomprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing\nconsiderations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays\ncan substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off\nbetween timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential\ndecision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We\ndesign a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline\ntaxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable\ntaxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic\nhumans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to\nmethods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and\ninformativeness.

Through knowledge distillation with the\nMLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC\nencoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on\ncontextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects\nand low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task. The\nframework features three core innovations: a MLLM-guided knowledge distillation\npipeline, an importance-weighted variable-length JSCC framework, and novel loss\nfunction designs that facilitate the knowledge distillation within the JSCC\nframework.

However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry\nmodeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture\nsynthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end\nPBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter\n(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR\nmaterials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel\nperspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.\nSpecifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV\ndiffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,\nenabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple\ndiffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns\nmultiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D\nGaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated\npost-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh\nassets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and\nimage-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables\nflexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the\nknowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely\n69k multi-view instances.

This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust\npreprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous\nevaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel\nfrequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet\ncoefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum.

The\nCatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on\nfixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an\nAUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT\ndenoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed\nthat including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG\nalone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results\ndemonstrate that combining denoising with domain relevant features can yield\nhighly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the\ndevelopment of cost effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly\nin low resource healthcare settings.",

However, RDMA has a limited\nset of operations, is difficult to program, and often requires multiple round\ntrips to perform simple application operations. Programmable SmartNICs provide\na different means to offload work from host CPUs to a NIC. This leaves\napplications with the complex choice of embedding logic as RPC handlers at\nservers, using RDMA's limited interface to access server structures via\nclient-side logic, or running some logic on SmartNICs. The best choice varies\nbetween workloads and over time. To solve this dilemma, we present NAAM,\nnetwork-accelerated active messages. NAAM applications specify small, portable\neBPF functions associated with messages. Each message specifies what data it\naccesses using an RDMA-like interface. NAAM runs at various places in the\nnetwork, including at clients, on server-attached SmartNICs, and server host\nCPU cores. Due to eBPF's portability, the code associated with a message can be\nrun at any location. Hence, the NAAM runtime can dynamically steer any message\nto execute its associated logic wherever it makes the most sense. To\ndemonstrate NAAM's flexibility, we built several applications, including the\nMICA hash table and lookups from a Cell-style B-tree. With an NVIDIA\nBlueField-2 SmartNIC and integrating its NIC-embedded switch, NAAM can run any\nof these operations on client, server, and NIC cores, shifting load in tens of\nmilliseconds on server compute congestion. NAAM dynamically offloads up to 1.8\nmillion MICA ops/s for YCSB-B and 750,000 Cell lookups/s from server CPUs.\nFinally, whereas iPipe, the state-of-the-art SmartNIC offload framework, only\nscales to 8 application offloads on BlueField-2, NAAM scales to hundreds of\napplication offloads with minimal impact on tail latency due to eBPF's low\noverhead.",

This is often accompanied by catastrophic\nforgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods\nhave been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been\nsurprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR\nobjectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those\nforgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge\nretention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the\npolicy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from\nits diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:\nusing the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,\nDiversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences\n(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By\ncontinuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to\nmaintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is\nmore training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator\nfunctions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online\nreference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving\nRLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a\npowerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.",

While it\nstrongly supports configurable consensus and access control, Fabric can face\nchallenges in achieving high transaction throughput and low rejection rates\nunder heavy workloads. These performance limitations are often attributed to\nendorsement, ordering, and validation bottlenecks. Further, optimistic\nconcurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource\ninefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only\nduring the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:\n(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as\nindependent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction\nin the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the\nincorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent\ndependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the\ncommitter, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.\nIncorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads\nwith varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher\nthroughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention\nscenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based\nexecution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining\ncompatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers.",

    "abstract": "Effective feedback, including critique and evaluation, helps designers\ndevelop design concepts and refine their ideas, supporting informed\ndecision-making throughout the iterative design process. However, in\nstudio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to\na lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to\ndevelop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage\nin multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time\nconstraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that\nLLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing\nthe educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based\nagents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing\nintellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target\npersona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we\npresent Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based\nagents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design\nfeedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback\nto an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the\nAI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that\nFeed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through\nrole-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an\nAI mentee. Based on these findings, we discuss future directions for designing\nsystems to foster feedback skills in design education.",

Model-based and learning-based methods\nare widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined\nmodels of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the\nabove limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,\nexisting PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training\nefficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are\nequivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper\ndevelops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a\nrisk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a\nsafety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting\nareas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.\nThe balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding\nvehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during\ntraining. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold\nchannel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.\nMoreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions\nwith risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation\nresults on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak\nreward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky\nareas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect\nEarth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars.\nUnfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their\nstatistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their\nvalidation, and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate,\nwhich is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for\nlife signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or\nscrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here\nwe propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the\ntransit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the\nresulting Null Signal Template (NST) has the same statistical properties as\nwith the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable\nstar-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real\ndata that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate\nthe statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like\nand super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP.\nWe identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not\nconsidered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius $1.5 R{\\oplus}$,\na period of 384 days, and KOI 2194.03 with radius $1.8 R{\\oplus}$ and a period\nof 445 days, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should\nbe considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20%\nFAP.",

However, existing benchmarks\ntend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially\nunder realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,\nand often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present\nLongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It\ncovers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion\nDetection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion\nExpression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,\nwith long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance\nperformance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them\nwith standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG\nmethod leverages both the conversation context and the large language model\nitself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The\nCoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five\nstages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge\ninjection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently\nenhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs\ntoward more practical and real-world EI applications.

This\npractice of ``internal travel,'' which gained traction during the COVID-19\npandemic to tackle nurse shortages, presents new operational challenges that\nrequire tailored analytical support. Key requirements such as advance notice\nand short-term secondments must be incorporated. Moreover, in rapidly evolving\nenvironments, reliance on historical data leads to unreliable forecasts,\nlimiting the effectiveness of traditional sample-based methods. Methodology: We\nformulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program and incorporate demand\nuncertainty via a sample robust optimization (SRO) framework. Using linear\ndecision rule approximation, we reformulate the problem as a tractable linear\nprogram. Results: We evaluate the impact of key network design components on\nsystem performance. Network connectivity has the largest effect in reducing the\ntotal cost, number of redeployments, and travel distance, but its benefits\ndepend on aligning the secondment duration with the network structure. Full\nconnectivity without proper secondments can be counterproductive. The SRO\napproach outperforms the traditional sample-average method in the presence of\ndemand surges or under-forecasts by better anticipating emergency\nredeployments. Managerial implications: Internal travel programs offer a\npromising strategy to alleviate workforce shortages in healthcare systems. Our\nresults highlight the importance of network design, aligning secondment\ndurations with the network structure, and adopting planning methods that are\nrobust to demand surges or inaccurate predictions.",

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of\nlight polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to\nbecome a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range\nof materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed\nfields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE\nmeasurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging.

Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances\ntheir capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert\nbranches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large\nnumber of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially\nin resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More\nimportantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a\nprefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage\nwhere only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a\nuniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.\nTo address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that\nexplicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert\nscheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a\ntwo-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the\ncomputation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the\ndecode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from\nactivation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,\nwithout requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B\nand 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to\n7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model\nsize.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the development of\nnumerous applications that require quick responses and low latency. Fog\ncomputing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but\nit faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore,\nit is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. A\nwell-designed job scheduling algorithm can help decrease energy usage and\nimprove response times for application requests. This work aims to schedule\ntasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and\nenhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into\naccount task deadlines. Initially, this paper classifies the Fog nodes into two\ncategories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules\nlow-deadline tasks on low-traffic-level nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle\nOptimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement of the Golden Eagle Optimization\nAlgorithm that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. High-deadline\ntasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL).\nThis combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle\nOptimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithms optimize system response time, total deadline violation\ntime, and resource and system energy consumption compared to other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

While text-to-speech (TTS)\ncan be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it\nfails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis,\nwhich derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising\nalternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and\nfinetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained\ninformation from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known\ncorrelation with vocal traits. Moreover, these pipelines are multi-stage, which\nrequires separate training of multiple components, thus leading to training\ninefficiency. To address these limitations, we utilize fine-grained facial\nattribute modeling by decomposing facial images into non-overlapping segments\nand progressively integrating them into a multi-granular representation. This\nrepresentation is further refined through multi-task learning of speaker\nattributes such as gender and ethnicity at both the visual and acoustic\ndomains. Moreover, to improve alignment robustness, we adopt a multi-view\ntraining strategy by pairing various visual perspectives of a speaker in terms\nof different angles and lighting conditions, with identical speech recordings.\nExtensive subjective and objective evaluations confirm that our approach\nsubstantially enhances face-voice congruence and synthesis stability.",

We introduce a two-step smoothing-matching argument. First, we\nconstruct a smoothed empirical operator from the given RGG.

We show that, after proper normalization, the first few nontrivial\nedge eigenvalues of the RGG converge with high probability to those of a\ndifferential operator, which can be computed explicitly through a simple\nsecond-order linear partial differential equation.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct\ncommunication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social\ncompanionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit\nlimitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world\nconversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt\ntheir communication style and emotional expression to different social and task\ncontexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training\nframework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for\nvarying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five\npersonality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that\ncombines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual\ntrait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially\noutperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional\nintelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general\nreasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct\nprompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers\nconsistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as\nmental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human\npreference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,\ndemonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its\ncomparatively smaller model size.

This\npaper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD)\nsemantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for\nmulti-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust\nfeature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop\na ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with\nenhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise\nratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white\nGaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image\nrestoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage\nknowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on\ninterference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature\naffinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a\ndiffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform\ninitial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual\nquality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate\nsuperior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory\nreconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These\nresults highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual\nmetrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image\nrecovery.",

By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in\nhigh-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et\nal. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through\nbaroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and\nwarm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this\nprocess is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and\nfolds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed\nincompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated\nSNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\\propto\nk^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism\ndescribed and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility\nthat the $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the\nunstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting\nsmall-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible\nturbulence cascade.",

Our\ngalaxy models are constructed based on the observed properties of nearby barred\ngalaxies from the S4G survey, and we systematically vary the halo scale radius\nto isolate its dynamical influence.

Furthermore, two\nestimation methods are developed: projection estimation and iterative least\nsquares estimation. The corresponding asymptotic properties of these estimators\nare established. Additionally, the order-determination problem is addressed. In\nthe simulation studies, the estimation results are given and the theoretical\nproperties are verified.

The FO-based controller generates reference\nsetpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady\nstate corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety\ncorrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to\nmaintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while\nrespecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational\nburden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical\napplicability.

A prevailing assumption in the community has been to\nanthropomorphize these tokens as \"thinking\", treating longer traces as evidence\nof higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine\nwhether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem\ndifficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational\ntraces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to\nsolve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem\ncomplexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,\nfinding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long\nreasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then\nsystematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that\nthe intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely\ncorrelate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those\nwhere the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the\neffect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive\ncomputation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the\nproblem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional\ndistance from the training data.

Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the\ncomplementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target\nmodeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.\nThirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the\ntransformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,\nmotivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector\nwith dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is\nproposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain\nEnhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba\n(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba\nscanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of\nimages, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency\nspectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local\ntarget modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,\nPriority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the\nconcept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features\naccording to the priority scores obtained from modality difference.

Many approaches require surrogate models to calculate energies\nwithin Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations. Inexpensive surrogates\nsuch as cluster expansions enable otherwise intractable calculations by\ninterpolating data from higher accuracy methods, such as Density Functional\nTheory (DFT). Surrogate models introduce uncertainty into downstream\ncalculations, in addition to any uncertainty inherent to DFT calculations.\nBayesian frameworks address this by quantifying uncertainty and incorporating\nexpert knowledge through priors. However, constructing effective priors remains\nchallenging. This work introduces and describes practical strategies for\nbuilding Bayesian cluster expansions, focusing on basis truncation,\nhyperparameter selection, and ground state replication. We analyze multiple\nbasis truncation schemes, compare cross-validation to the\nevidence-approximation for hyperparameter optimization, and provide methods to\nfind and enforce ground-state-preserving models through priors. Additionally,\nwe compare the uncertainties between different approximations to DFT (LDA, PBE,\nSCAN) against the uncertainty introduced with the use of cluster expansion\nsurrogate models. These approaches are demonstrated on the BCC Li$_x$Mg$_{1-x}$\nand Li$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ alloys, which are both of interest for solid-state Li\nbatteries.

While most prior work frames spoof detection as a binary\ntask, real-world attacks often involve hybrid utterances that mix genuine and\nsynthetic speech, making detection substantially more challenging. To address\nthis gap, we introduce the Hybrid Spoofed Audio Dataset (HSAD), a benchmark\ncontaining 1,248 clean and 41,044 degraded utterances across four classes:\nhuman, cloned, zero-shot AI-generated, and hybrid audio. Each sample is\nannotated with spoofing method, speaker identity, and degradation metadata to\nenable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate six transformer-based models,\nincluding spectrogram encoders (MIT-AST, MattyB95-AST) and self-supervised\nwaveform models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT). Results reveal critical lessons: pretrained\nmodels overgeneralize and collapse under hybrid conditions; spoof-specific\nfine-tuning improves separability but struggles with unseen compositions; and\ndataset-specific adaptation on HSAD yields large performance gains (AST greater\nthan 97 percent and F1 score is approximately 99 percent), though residual\nerrors persist for complex hybrids.

However, modern\nrenewable-dominated power grids face an increased risk of insecurity due to low\ninertia and nonlinear frequency responses. To mitigate these risks, robust\npre-fault frequency security assessment (FSA) is critical, which enables grid\noperators to implement preventive control strategies. We propose a\ndata-knowledge fusion framework to achieve intelligent FSA in actual power\ngrids. First, we classify FSA domain knowledge into two distinct categories:\n(1) physics-guided knowledge directs the neural network pre-training process,\nensuring that the fusion model's predictions consistent with frequency response\nmechanisms, and (2) physics-constrained knowledge establishes quantitative\nrelationship on predictions, which forces them within theoretical ranges\ndefined by domain knowledge. Furthermore, we develop a dual-channel neural\nnetwork architecture to simultaneously capture both local and global\ncharacteristics of the power system. Finally, we introduce a data-knowledge\nfusion training algorithm that integrates guided learning with constrained\nnetwork architecture to enhance model reliability and generalization. Case\nstudies on China's Yunnan Provincial Power Grid validate the superior\nperformance of our framework: it reduces average prediction error to 1.26% (a\n49.2% reduction over data-driven methods), and maintains 97.60% accuracy in\nuntrained scenarios (3.85% higher than data-driven methods), therefore\nsatisfies the accuracy, reliability, and generalization requirements for actual\npower grids.

    "abstract": "Quantifying differences between flow fields is a key challenge in fluid\nmechanics, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of flow control.\nTraditional vector metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, provide\nstraightforward pointwise comparisons but can fail to distinguish\ndistributional changes in flow fields. To address this limitation, we employ\noptimal transport (OT) theory, which is a mathematical framework built on\nprobability and measure theory. By aligning Euclidean distances between flow\nfields in a latent space learned by an autoencoder with the corresponding OT\ngeodesics, we seek to learn low-dimensional representations of flow fields that\nare interpretable from the perspective of unbalanced OT. As a demonstration, we\nutilize this OT-based analysis on controlled, separated flows past a NACA 0012\nairfoil with a chord-based Reynolds number of 23,000 and a freestream Mach\nnumber of 0.3 for two angles of attack of $6^\\circ$ and $9^\\circ$. For each\nangle of attack, we identify a two-dimensional embedding that succinctly\ncaptures the different effective regimes of flow responses and control\nperformance, characterized by the degree of suppression of the separation\nbubble and secondary effects from laminarization and trailing-edge separation.\nThe interpretation of the latent representation was found to be consistent\nacross the two angles of attack, suggesting that the OT-based latent encoding\nwas capable of extracting physical relationships that are common across the\ndifferent suites of cases. This study demonstrates the potential utility of\noptimal transport in the analysis and interpretation of complex flow fields.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by\npretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,\nSFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into\nstructured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly\nestablished methodology for effective training data selection. Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable\ntraining data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods\ntypically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and\nincurring additional costs for prompt design.\n  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal\nRepresentations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by\nanalyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes\nsimilarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final\nhidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that\nwere largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide\nrange of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.\nMoreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity\nwith the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.\nExperiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less\nfamiliar data leads to better generalization performance.",

    "abstract": "This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding\n(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as\na Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging\nframework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking\nthrough AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of\nAI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where\ntwo students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.\nWe adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video\nrecordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.\nContrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional\napplication cohering to her intended design, while another encountered\ntechnical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual\nfunctionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering\napproaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing\nauthorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and\nthat differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe\ncoding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding\ninstruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured\nprompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and\ndeveloping vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.",

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery drives progress across disciplines, from fundamental\nphysics to industrial applications. However, identifying physical laws\nautomatically from gathered datasets requires identifying the structure and\nparameters of the formula underlying the data, which involves navigating a vast\nsearch space and consuming substantial computational resources. To address\nthese issues, we build on the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem and Taylor's theorem to\ncreate a unified representation of diverse formulas, which introduces latent\nvariables to form a two-stage structure. To minimize the search space, we\ninitially focus on determining the structure of the latent formula, including\nthe relevant contributing inputs, the count of latent variables, and their\ninterconnections. Following this, the process of parameter identification is\nexpedited by enforcing dimensional constraints for physical relevance, favoring\nsimplicity in the formulas, and employing strategic optimization techniques.\nAny overly complex outcomes are refined using symbolic regression for a compact\nform. These general strategic techniques drastically reduce search iterations\nfrom hundreds of millions to just tens, significantly enhancing the efficiency\nof data-driven formula discovery. We performed comprehensive validation to\ndemonstrate FIND's effectiveness in discovering physical laws, dimensionless\nnumbers, partial differential equations, and uniform critical system parameters\nacross various fields, including astronomy, physics, chemistry, and\nelectronics. The excellent performances across 11 distinct datasets position\nFIND as a powerful and versatile tool for advancing data-driven scientific\ndiscovery in multiple domains.",

The resonance is genuinely\ndisorder-mediated, as it vanishes in the corresponding disorder-free system. To\nexplain this phenomenon, we develop a physical theory based on an effective\nthermodynamic potential, which also accounts for the associated scaling\nbehavior.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis have enabled accurate decoding of\nmental state from brain activation patterns during functional magnetic\nresonance imaging scans. A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal\ncomponents regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).\nThis model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant\ninformation, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in\nspecific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal\nset of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the\ncognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that\nallow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal\ncomponent, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely\nto be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we\npropose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which\nintegrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity\nframework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply\nthe models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and\nemotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity\nranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification\nperformance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\\% improvement in cross-validated\ndeviance $R^2$ and 7.3\\% improvement in cross-validated AUC. Furthermore,\nsparsity-ranked models perform as well as or better than standard LASSO PCR\napproaches across all classification tasks and allocate predictive weight to\nbrain regions consistent with their established functional roles, offering a\nrobust alternative for MVPA.",

Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than\n$17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence\ncounterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST\ntowards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected\ntwice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in\ndifferent bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to\n4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections\nover 10 years of the LSST operation.

We adapt the\nBioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the\nscientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a\nsynthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo\nand simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical\npower to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of\nthe injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable\nzone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of\nroughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker\nalbedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission\nis designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would\nbe able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable\nzone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore\nmultiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as\nreducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables\nsuch as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo\nfrom full spectral retrievals.",
