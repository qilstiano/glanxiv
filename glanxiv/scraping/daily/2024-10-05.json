    "abstract": "The current approach for new Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and\nConnected and Automated Driving (CAD) function development involves a\nsignificant amount of public road testing which is inefficient due to the\nnumber miles that need to be driven for rare and extreme events to take place,\nthereby being very costly also, and unsafe as the rest of the road users become\ninvoluntary test subjects. A new development, evaluation and demonstration\nmethod for safe, efficient, and repeatable development, demonstration and\nevaluation of ADAS and CAD functions called VehicleInVirtualEnvironment (VVE)\nwas recently introduced as a solution to this problem. The vehicle is operated\nin a large, empty, and flat area during VVE while its localization and\nperception sensor data is fed from the virtual environment with other traffic\nand rare and extreme events being generated as needed. The virtual environment\ncan be easily configured and modified to construct different testing scenarios\non demand. This paper focuses on the VVE approach and introduces the coordinate\ntransformations needed to sync pose (location and orientation) in the virtual\nand physical worlds and handling of localization and perception sensor data\nusing the highly realistic 3D simulation model of a recent autonomous shuttle\ndeployment site in Columbus, Ohio as the virtual world. As a further example\nthat uses multiple actors, the use of VVE for VehicleToVRU communication based\nVulnerable Road User (VRU) safety is presented in the paper using VVE\nexperiments and real pedestrian(s) in a safe and repeatable manner. VVE\nexperiments are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the method.",

In this work, we address these\nfundamental challenges by developing a lumped element model that enables\ninterrogation of the physics that govern ionic circuits, as well as rapid\ndesign and optimization. Our model captures features specific to ionic charge\ncarriers, while preserving the hierarchical design flexibility and\ncomputational efficiency of traditional circuit modeling. We demonstrate that\nour model can not only fit individual device behavior but also accurately\npredict the behavior of larger circuits formed by combining those devices.\nAdditionally, we show how our tool utilizes the intrinsic non-linearities of\nionic systems to enable novel functionality, revealing how factors such as ion\nenrichment, ion leakage, and polymer charge density influence performance.\nFinally, we present a fully ionic power supply, sensor, control system, and\nactuator for a soft robot that adapts its motion in response to environmental\nsalt, illustrating the tool's potential to accelerate advancements in chemical\nsensing, biointerfacing, biomimetic systems, and adaptive materials.",

    "abstract": "Dryland vegetation can survive water stress by forming spatial patterns but\nis often subjected to herbivory as an additional stress that puts it at risk of\ndesertification. Understanding the mutual relationships between vegetation\npatterning and herbivory is crucial for securing food production in drylands,\nwhich constitute the majority of rangelands worldwide. Here, we introduce a\nnovel vegetation-herbivore model that captures pattern-forming feedbacks\nassociated with water and herbivory stress and a behavioral aspect of\nherbivores representing an exploitation strategy.Applying numerical\ncontinuation methods, we analyze the bifurcation structure of uniform and\npatterned vegetation-herbivore solutions, and use direct numerical simulations\nto study various forms of collective herbivore dynamics. We find that herbivory\nstress can induce traveling vegetation-herbivore waves and uncover the\necological mechanism that drives their formation. In the traveling-wave state,\nthe herbivore distribution is asymmetric with higher density on one side of\neach vegetation patch. At low precipitation values their distribution is\nlocalized, while at high precipitation the herbivores are spread over the\nentire landscape. Importantly, their asymmetric distribution results in uneven\nherbivory stress, strong on one side of each vegetation patch and weak on the\nopposing side - weaker than the stress exerted in spatially uniform herbivore\ndistribution. Consequently, the formation of traveling waves results in\nincreased sustainability to herbivory stress. We conclude that\nvegetation-herbivore traveling waves may play an essential role in sustaining\nherbivore populations under conditions of combined water and herbivory stress,\nthereby contributing to food security in endangered regions threatened by\ndroughts and population growth.",

    "abstract": "Due to the difficulty of replicating the real conditions during training,\nsupervised algorithms for spacecraft pose estimation experience a drop in\nperformance when trained on synthetic data and applied to real operational\ndata. To address this issue, we propose a test-time adaptation approach that\nleverages the temporal redundancy between images acquired during close\nproximity operations. Our approach involves extracting features from sequential\nspacecraft images, estimating their poses, and then using this information to\nsynthesise a reconstructed view. We establish a self-supervised learning\nobjective by comparing the synthesised view with the actual one. During\ntraining, we supervise both pose estimation and image synthesis, while at\ntest-time, we optimise the self-supervised objective. Additionally, we\nintroduce a regularisation loss to prevent solutions that are not consistent\nwith the keypoint structure of the spacecraft.

    "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs), including hurricanes and typhoons, cause significant\nproperty damage and result in fatalities, making it crucial to understand the\nfactors driving extreme TCs. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences\nTC formation through tropospheric vorticity, wind shear, and atmospheric\ncirculations. Apart from atmospheric changes, oceans influence activity through\nsea surface temperatures (SSTs) and deep ocean heat content. These Atlantic\nSSTs determine the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which indicates SST\nvariability in the Atlantic. This research focuses on ENSO, AMO, and SSTs\nimpact on the strength and frequency of TCs in the North Atlantic Basin. AMO\nand SST anomalies are increasing at an alarming rate, but it remains unclear\nhow their dynamics will influence future TC behavior. I used observational\ncyclone track data from 1950 to 2023, the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), and NOAAs\nExtended Reconstructed SST V5 (ERSST). I found that Increasing SSTs over the\npast decade indicate stronger TCs, while warm phase AMO periods correspond with\nhigher TC frequency. Meanwhile, a greater frequency of landfalling TCs can be\nattributed to La Nina or ENSO-neutral, with El Nino decreasing the frequency of\nlandfalling TCs. Such relationships suggest that as the seasonal predictability\nof ENSO and SSTs improve, seasonal TC forecasts may improve.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to generalize when graphs exhibit\nboth homophily (same-class connections) and heterophily (different-class\nconnections). Specifically, GNNs tend to underperform for nodes with local\nhomophily levels that differ significantly from the global homophily level.\nThis issue poses a risk in user-centric applications where underrepresented\nhomophily levels are present. Concurrently, fairness within GNNs has received\nsubstantial attention due to the potential amplification of biases via message\npassing. However, the connection between local homophily and fairness in GNNs\nremains underexplored. In this work, we move beyond global homophily and\nexplore how local homophily levels can lead to unfair predictions. We begin by\nformalizing the challenge of fair predictions for underrepresented homophily\nlevels as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. We then conduct a theoretical\nanalysis that demonstrates how local homophily levels can alter predictions for\ndiffering sensitive attributes. We additionally introduce three new GNN\nfairness benchmarks, as well as a novel semi-synthetic graph generator, to\nempirically study the OOD problem. Across extensive analysis we find that two\nfactors can promote unfairness: (a) OOD distance, and (b) heterophilous nodes\nsituated in homophilous graphs. In cases where these two conditions are met,\nfairness drops by up to 24% on real world datasets, and 30% in semi-synthetic\ndatasets.

Thus, precise evaluation of preference strength holds paramount\nimportance in preference modeling. However, an easily overlooked factor\nsignificantly affecting preference strength measurement is that human attitudes\ntowards two responses may not solely indicate a preference for one over the\nother and ties are also a common occurrence.

We prove that even with the access to the true distributions of\nprompt and response, disregarding ties can lead to a notable bias in preference\nstrength measurement. Comprehensive experiments further validate the advantages\nof incorporating ties in preference modeling. Notably, fine-tuning with BTT\nsignificantly outperforms fine-tuning with BT on synthetic preference datasets\nwith ties, labeled by state-of-the-art open-source LLMs.",

Joint reconstruction\n(JR) of the IP and SOS distributions from PACT measurement data alone can\naddress this issue.

While certain regularization\nstrategies have been deployed, stabilizing the JR problem to yield accurate\nestimates of the IP and SOS distributions has remained an open challenge. To\naddress this, the presented numerical studies explore the effectiveness of easy\nto implement canonical object constraints for stabilizing the JR problem.

At its core is the attention mechanism for calculating\ncorrelations between pairs of tokens. Performing an attention computation takes\nquadratic time in the input size, and had become the time bottleneck for\ntransformer operations. In order to circumvent this, researchers have used a\nvariety of approaches, including designing heuristic algorithms for performing\nattention computations faster, and proposing alternatives to the attention\nmechanism which can be computed more quickly. For instance, state space models\nsuch as Mamba were designed to replace attention with an almost linear time\nalternative.\n  In this paper, we prove that any such approach cannot perform important tasks\nthat Transformer is able to perform (assuming a popular conjecture from\nfine-grained complexity theory).

We prove that Transformer is able to perform\nthis task, and we prove that this task cannot be performed in truly\nsubquadratic time by any algorithm. Thus, any model which can be evaluated in\nsubquadratic time - whether because of subquadratic-time heuristics for\nattention, faster attention replacements like Mamba, or any other reason -\ncannot perform this task.

    "abstract": "The Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem is a fundamental challenge in\ndistributed systems, focusing on achieving reaching an agreement among parties,\nsome of which may behave maliciously. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, there\nhas been significant interest in developing atomic broadcast protocols, which\nfacilitate agreement on a subset of parties' requests. However, these protocols\noften come with high communication complexity ($O(ln^2 + \\lambda n^3 \\log n)$,\nwhere $l$ is the bit length of the input, $n$ is the number of parties, and\n$\\lambda$ represents the security parameter bit length). This can lead to\ninefficiency, especially when the requests across parties exhibit little\nvariation, resulting in unnecessary resource consumption. In this paper, we\nintroduce Slim-ABC, a novel atomic broadcast protocol that eliminates the\n$O(ln^2 + \\lambda n^3 \\log n)$ term associated with traditional atomic\nbroadcast protocols. While Slim-ABC reduces the number of accepted requests, it\nsignificantly mitigates resource wastage, making it more efficient. The\nprotocol leverages the asynchronous common subset and provable-broadcast\nmechanisms to achieve a communication complexity of $O(ln^2 + \\lambda n^2)$.\nDespite the trade-off in accepted requests, Slim-ABC maintains robust security\nby allowing only a fraction ($f+1$) of parties to broadcast requests. We\npresent an extensive efficiency analysis of Slim-ABC, evaluating its\nperformance across key metrics such as message complexity, communication\ncomplexity, and time complexity. Additionally, we provide a rigorous security\nanalysis, demonstrating that Slim-ABC satisfies the \\textit{agreement},\n\\textit{validity}, and \\textit{totality} properties of the asynchronous common\nsubset protocol.",

    "abstract": "Links are a fundamental part of information networks, turning isolated pieces\nof knowledge into a network of information that is much richer than the sum of\nits parts. However, adding a new link to the network is not trivial: it\nrequires not only the identification of a suitable pair of source and target\nentities but also the understanding of the content of the source to locate a\nsuitable position for the link in the text. The latter problem has not been\naddressed effectively, particularly in the absence of text spans in the source\nthat could serve as anchors to insert a link to the target entity. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce and operationalize the task of entity insertion in\ninformation networks. Focusing on the case of Wikipedia, we empirically show\nthat this problem is, both, relevant and challenging for editors. We compile a\nbenchmark dataset in 105 languages and develop a framework for entity insertion\ncalled LocEI (Localized Entity Insertion) and its multilingual variant XLocEI.\nWe show that XLocEI outperforms all baseline models (including state-of-the-art\nprompt-based ranking with LLMs such as GPT-4) and that it can be applied in a\nzero-shot manner on languages not seen during training with minimal performance\ndrop. These findings are important for applying entity insertion models in\npractice, e.g., to support editors in adding links across the more than 300\nlanguage versions of Wikipedia.",

Extensive computational experiments show that RPF-SFISTA is roughly 3\nto 15 times faster than other state-of-the-art restarted methods on four\nimportant classes of problems. The A-REG method, developed for convex composite\noptimization, solves each of its strongly convex regularized subproblems\naccording to a stationarity criterion by using the RPF-SFISTA method with a\npossibly aggressive choice of initial strong convexity estimate.

    "abstract": "Resolving knowledge conflicts is a crucial challenge in Question Answering\n(QA) tasks, as the internet contains numerous conflicting facts and opinions.\nWhile some research has made progress in tackling ambiguous settings where\nmultiple valid answers exist, these approaches often neglect to provide source\ncitations, leaving users to evaluate the factuality of each answer. On the\nother hand, existing work on citation generation has focused on unambiguous\nsettings with single answers, failing to address the complexity of real-world\nscenarios. Despite the importance of both aspects, no prior research has\ncombined them, leaving a significant gap in the development of QA systems. In\nthis work, we bridge this gap by proposing the novel task of QA with source\ncitation in ambiguous settings, where multiple valid answers exist. To\nfacilitate research in this area, we create a comprehensive framework\nconsisting of: (1) five novel datasets, obtained by augmenting three existing\nreading comprehension datasets with citation meta-data across various ambiguous\nsettings, such as distractors and paraphrasing; (2) the first ambiguous\nmulti-hop QA dataset featuring real-world, naturally occurring contexts; (3)\ntwo new metrics to evaluate models' performances; and (4) several strong\nbaselines using rule-based, prompting, and finetuning approaches over five\nlarge language models. We hope that this new task, datasets, metrics, and\nbaselines will inspire the community to push the boundaries of QA research and\ndevelop more trustworthy and interpretable systems.",

In this\napproach, the comb of extreme ultraviolet harmonics typically lies above the\nionization threshold of the target under investigation, thus releasing a\nphotoelectron by single-photon absorption. The interaction of the outgoing\nphotoelectron with the infrared pulse results in the absorption or emission of\ninfrared photons, thereby creating additional peaks in the photoelectron\nspectrum, referred to as sidebands. While, in the absence of resonances in the\nfirst ionization step, the phases imparted on the photoionization process\nevolve smoothly with the photon energy, the presence of intermediate resonances\nimprints a large additional phase on the outgoing photoelectron wave packet. In\nthis work, using a comb of harmonics below and above the ionization threshold\nof neon, we investigate the effect of intermediate bound excited states on\nattosecond photoelectron interferometry. We show that the phase of the\noscillations of the sidebands and their angular distributions are strongly\naffected by such resonances.

    "abstract": "Domain shifts are ubiquitous in machine learning, and can substantially\ndegrade a model's performance when deployed to real-world data. To address\nthis, distribution alignment methods aim to learn feature representations which\nare invariant across domains, by minimising the discrepancy between the\ndistributions. However, the discrepancy estimates can be extremely noisy when\ntraining via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and shifts in the relative\nproportions of different subgroups can lead to domain misalignments; these can\nboth stifle the benefits of the method. This paper proposes to improve these\nestimates by inducing diversity in each sampled minibatch. This simultaneously\nbalances the data and reduces the variance of the gradients, thereby enhancing\nthe model's generalisation ability. We describe two options for diversity-based\ndata samplers, based on the k-determinantal point process (k-DPP) and the\nk-means++ algorithm, which can function as drop-in replacements for a standard\nrandom sampler. On a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event\ndetection, we show that both options 1) yield minibatches which are more\nrepresentative of the full dataset; 2) reduce the distance estimation error\nbetween distributions, for a given sample size; and 3) improve\nout-of-distribution accuracy for two distribution alignment algorithms, as well\nas standard ERM.",

A combination of DFT-based electronic band\nstructure and projected density of states (PDOS) calculations with simulated\nXANES enables us to explain the observed main XANES features labelled by a, A,\nB', B and C when considering the orbital hybridizations, crystal field\nsplitting (CFS) and core-hole screening of different 3d configurations for\nSL-La214 and BL-La327 nickelates. At high pressure (HP), the delta_E values of\npre-edge peak form a dome-like evolution above 7.7 GPa with the maximum\nlocating at around 20 GPa for metallic BL-La327. Analysis of its integrated\narea and FWHM provides strong evidence that the bonding d_3z^2-r^2 band crosses\nE_F above about 7.7 GPa for the metallic BL-La327. Growth of integrated area of\npre-edge peak and C peak further evidences pressure-induced hole doping effect.\nMeanwhile, the pressure dependent FWHM of pre-edge peak implies a nonmonotonic\nevolution of orbital-selective electronic correlation above 7.7 GPa with\nextrema emerging at about 20 GPa. Moreover, we estimate the relative hole\ndoping level using the energy shift of pre-edge peak, yielding 0.074 hole per\nNi site or equivalently 1.1*10^21 cm^-3 at 20 GPa for the metallic BL-La327,\nwhich is comparable to cuprates.

Methods that construct features solely on voltage-capacity\nprofile data typically fail to generalize across cell chemistries. This study\nintroduces a methodology that combines traditional voltage-capacity features\nwith Direct Current Internal Resistance (DCIR) measurements, enabling more\naccurate and generalizable EOL predictions. The use of early-cycle DCIR data\ncaptures critical degradation mechanisms related to internal resistance growth,\nenhancing model robustness. Models are shown to successfully predict the number\nof cycles to EOL for unseen manufacturers of varied electrode composition with\na mean absolute error (MAE) of 150 cycles. This cross-manufacturer\ngeneralizability reduces the need for extensive new data collection and\nretraining, enabling manufacturers to optimize new battery designs using\nexisting datasets. Additionally, a novel DCIR-compatible dataset is released as\npart of ongoing efforts to enrich the growing ecosystem of cycling data and\naccelerate battery materials development.",

We first prove an equivalence between two\nforms of such algorithms and describe them in terms of suitable characteristic\npolynomials. Then we develop a general expansion of the loss in terms of signal\nand noise propagators. Using it, we show that losses of stationary stable\nmemory-$M$ algorithms always retain the exponent $\\xi$ of plain GD, but can\nhave different constants $C_L$ depending on their effective learning rate that\ngeneralizes that of HB. We prove that in memory-1 algorithms we can make $C_L$\narbitrarily small while maintaining stability. As a consequence, we propose a\nmemory-1 algorithm with a time-dependent schedule that we show heuristically\nand experimentally to improve the exponent $\\xi$ of plain SGD.",

In this\nwork, we aim to assess the limitations introduced in the observational works\nwhen a uniform density is assumed along the line of sight for fitting the\nobservations, developing a very simple numerical model of a turbulent box. We\nperform a MHD simulation in order to reproduce the turbulent steady-state of a\nturbulent box with properties typical of a molecular filament before collapse.\nWe post-process the results of the MHD simulation with a chemical code to\npredict molecular abundances, and then post-process this cube with a radiative\ntransfer code to create synthetic emission maps for a series of rotational\ntransitions observed during the GEMS project. From the chemical point of view,\nwe find that turbulence produces variations on the predicted abundances, but\nthey are more or less critical depending on the chosen transition and the\nchemical age. When compared to real observations, the results from the\nturbulent simulation provides a better fit than when assuming a uniform gas\ndistribution along the line of sight. In the view of our results, we conclude\nthat taking into account turbulence when fitting observations might\nsignificantly improve the agreement with model predictions. This is especially\nimportant for sulfur bearing species that are very sensitive to the variations\nof density produced by turbulence at early times (0.1 Myr). The abundance of CO\nis also quite sensitive to turbulence when considering the evolution beyond a\nfew 0.1 Myr.",

Most existing\nmethods are trying to derive one-step diffusion models from multi-step\ncounterparts through knowledge distillation (KD) or variational score\ndistillation (VSD). However, these methods are limited by the capabilities of\nthe teacher model, especially if the teacher model itself is not sufficiently\nstrong. To tackle these issues, we propose a new One-Step \\textbf{D}iffusion\nmodel with a larger-scale \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{D}iscriminator for SR,\ncalled D$^3$SR. Our discriminator is able to distill noisy features from any\ntime step of diffusion models in the latent space. In this way, our diffusion\ndiscriminator breaks through the potential limitations imposed by the presence\nof a teacher model. Additionally, we improve the perceptual loss with\nedge-aware DISTS (EA-DISTS) to enhance the model's ability to generate fine\ndetails. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared with previous\ndiffusion-based methods requiring dozens or even hundreds of steps, our D$^3$SR\nattains comparable or even superior results in both quantitative metrics and\nqualitative evaluations. Moreover, compared with other methods, D$^3$SR\nachieves at least $3\\times$ faster inference speed and reduces parameters by at\nleast 30\\%.

To address the\nhigh-dimensionality of multi-omics data, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute\nShrinkage and Selection Operator) regression for feature selection, leading to\nthe creation of LASSO-MOGCN, LASSO-MOGAT, and LASSO-MOTGN models. Graph\nstructures for the networks were constructed using gene correlation matrices\nand protein-protein interaction networks for multi-omics integration of\nmessenger-RNA, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation data. Such data integration\nenables the networks to dynamically focus on important relationships between\nbiological entities, improving both model performance and interpretability.\nAmong the models, LASSO-MOGAT with a correlation-based graph structure achieved\nstate-of-the-art accuracy (95.9%) and outperformed the LASSO-MOGCN and\nLASSO-MOTGN models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings\ndemonstrate that integrating multi-omics data in graph-based architectures\nenhances cancer classification performance by uncovering distinct molecular\npatterns that contribute to a better understanding of cancer biology and\npotential biomarkers for disease progression.",

    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems have found\napplications across diverse domains such as recommender systems, healthcare,\nand finance. Traditional MAB algorithms typically assume stationary reward\ndistributions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios\ncharacterized by non-stationary dynamics. This paper addresses this limitation\nby introducing and evaluating novel Bandit algorithms designed for\nnon-stationary environments. First, we present the Adaptive Discounted Thompson\nSampling (ADTS) algorithm, which enhances adaptability through relaxed\ndiscounting and sliding window mechanisms to better respond to changes in\nreward distributions. We then extend this approach to the Portfolio\nOptimization problem by introducing the Combinatorial Adaptive Discounted\nThompson Sampling (CADTS) algorithm, which addresses computational challenges\nwithin Combinatorial Bandits and improves dynamic asset allocation.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel architecture called Bandit Networks, which\nintegrates the outputs of ADTS and CADTS, thereby mitigating computational\nlimitations in stock selection. Through extensive experiments using real\nfinancial market data, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms and\narchitectures in adapting to dynamic environments and optimizing\ndecision-making processes. For instance, the proposed bandit network instances\npresent superior performance when compared to classic portfolio optimization\napproaches, such as capital asset pricing model, equal weights, risk parity,\nand Markovitz, with the best network presenting an out-of-sample Sharpe Ratio\n20% higher than the best performing classical model.",

    "abstract": "Neural Functional Networks (NFNs) have gained increasing interest due to\ntheir wide range of applications, including extracting information from\nimplicit representations of data, editing network weights, and evaluating\npolicies. A key design principle of NFNs is their adherence to the permutation\nand scaling symmetries inherent in the connectionist structure of the input\nneural networks. Recent NFNs have been proposed with permutation and scaling\nequivariance based on either graph-based message-passing mechanisms or\nparameter-sharing mechanisms. However, graph-based equivariant NFNs suffer from\nhigh memory consumption and long running times. On the other hand,\nparameter-sharing-based NFNs built upon equivariant linear layers exhibit lower\nmemory consumption and faster running time, yet their expressivity is limited\ndue to the large size of the symmetric group of the input neural networks. The\nchallenge of designing a permutation and scaling equivariant NFN that maintains\nlow memory consumption and running time while preserving expressivity remains\nunresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel solution with the development of\nMAGEP-NFN (Monomial mAtrix Group Equivariant Polynomial NFN). Our approach\nfollows the parameter-sharing mechanism but differs from previous works by\nconstructing a nonlinear equivariant layer represented as a polynomial in the\ninput weights. This polynomial formulation enables us to incorporate additional\nrelationships between weights from different input hidden layers, enhancing the\nmodel's expressivity while keeping memory consumption and running time low,\nthereby addressing the aforementioned challenge. We provide empirical evidence\ndemonstrating that MAGEP-NFN achieves competitive performance and efficiency\ncompared to existing baselines.",

In this paper, we propose an\nefficient and flexible attention architecture that enables the extension of\ncontext lengths in large language models with reduced computational resources\nand fine-tuning time compared to other excellent methods. Specifically, we\nintroduce correlation-aware selection and merging mechanisms to facilitate\nefficient sparse attention. In addition, we also propose a novel data\naugmentation technique involving positional encodings to enhance generalization\nto unseen positions. The results are as follows: First, using a single A100, we\nachieve fine-tuning on Llama2-7B with a sequence length of 32K, which is more\nefficient than other methods that rely on subsets for regression. Second, we\npresent a comprehensive method for extending context lengths across the\npre-training, fine-tuning, and inference phases. During pre-training, our\nattention mechanism partially breaks translation invariance during token\nselection, so we apply positional encodings only to the selected tokens. This\napproach achieves relatively high performance and significant extrapolation\ncapabilities. For fine-tuning, we introduce Cyclic, Randomly Truncated, and\nDynamically Growing NTK Positional Embedding (CRD NTK). This design allows\nfine-tuning with a sequence length of only 16K, enabling models such as\nLlama2-7B and Mistral-7B to perform inference with context lengths of up to 1M\nor even arbitrary lengths. Our method achieves 100\\% accuracy on the passkey\ntask with a context length of 4M and maintains stable perplexity at a 1M\ncontext length.

Timed testing, an\nattention-demanding stress task, has become increasingly important in assessing\nstudents' academic performance. However, there is insufficient research on how\nbackground noise affects performance in timed stress tasks by impacting\nattention, which this study aims to address. The paper-based SAT math test\nunder increased time pressure was administered twice: once in silence and once\nwith conversational and traffic background noise. Attention is negatively\nattributed to increasing blink rate, measured using eye landmarks from dLib's\nmachine-learning facial-detection model. First, the study affirms that\nbackground noise detriments attention and performance. Attention, through blink\nrate, is established as an indicator of stress task performance. Second, the\nstudy finds that participants whose blink rates increased due to background\nnoise differed in performance compared to those whose blink rates decreased,\npossibly correlating with their self-perception of noise's impact on attention.\nThird, using a case study, the study finds that a student with ADHD had\nenhanced performance and attention from background noise. Fourth, the study\nfinds that although both groups began with similar blink rates, the group\nexposed to noise had significantly increased blink rate near the end,\nindicating that noise reduces attention over time. While schools can generally\nprovide quiet settings for timed stress tasks, the study recommends\npersonalized treatments for students based on how noise affects them.

    "abstract": "Recently, numerous preference optimization algorithms have been introduced as\nextensions to the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) family. While these\nmethods have successfully aligned models with human preferences, there is a\nlack of understanding regarding the contributions of their additional\ncomponents. Moreover, fair and consistent comparisons are scarce, making it\ndifficult to discern which components genuinely enhance downstream performance.\nIn this work, we propose RainbowPO, a unified framework that demystifies the\neffectiveness of existing DPO methods by categorizing their key components into\nseven broad directions. We integrate these components into a single cohesive\nobjective, enhancing the performance of each individual element. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that RainbowPO outperforms existing DPO\nvariants. Additionally, we provide insights to guide researchers in developing\nnew DPO methods and assist practitioners in their implementations.",

    "abstract": "Peer review is the quality assessment of a manuscript by one or more peer\nexperts. Papers are submitted by the authors to scientific venues, and these\npapers must be reviewed by peers or other authors. The meta-reviewers then\ngather the peer reviews, assess them, and create a meta-review and decision for\neach manuscript. As the number of papers submitted to these venues has grown in\nrecent years, it becomes increasingly challenging for meta-reviewers to collect\nthese peer evaluations on time while still maintaining the quality that is the\nprimary goal of meta-review creation. In this paper, we address two peer review\naggregation challenges a meta-reviewer faces: paper acceptance decision-making\nand meta-review generation. Firstly, we propose to automate the process of\nacceptance decision prediction by applying traditional machine learning\nalgorithms. We use pre-trained word embedding techniques BERT to process the\nreviews written in natural language text. For the meta-review generation, we\npropose a transfer learning model based on the T5 model. Experimental results\nshow that BERT is more effective than the other word embedding techniques, and\nthe recommendation score is an important feature for the acceptance decision\nprediction. In addition, we figure out that fine-tuned T5 outperforms other\ninference models. Our proposed system takes peer reviews and other relevant\nfeatures as input to produce a meta-review and make a judgment on whether or\nnot the paper should be accepted. In addition, experimental results show that\nthe acceptance decision prediction system of our task outperforms the existing\nmodels, and the meta-review generation task shows significantly improved scores\ncompared to the existing models. For the statistical test, we utilize the\nWilcoxon signed-rank test to assess whether there is a statistically\nsignificant improvement between paired observations.",

While existing\napproaches like domain adaptation and test-time training (TTT) offer partial\nsolutions, they typically require additional data or domain-specific auxiliary\ntasks. We present Idempotent Test-Time Training (IT$^3$), a novel approach that\nenables on-the-fly adaptation to distribution shifts using only the current\ntest instance, without any auxiliary task design. Our key insight is that\nenforcing idempotence -- where repeated applications of a function yield the\nsame result -- can effectively replace domain-specific auxiliary tasks used in\nprevious TTT methods. We theoretically connect idempotence to prediction\nconfidence and demonstrate that minimizing the distance between successive\napplications of our model during inference leads to improved\nout-of-distribution performance. Extensive experiments across diverse domains\n(including image classification, aerodynamics prediction, and aerial\nsegmentation) and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) show that IT$^3$\nconsistently outperforms existing approaches while being simpler and more\nwidely applicable.

Upon extensive evaluation using\nLongGenBench, we observe that: (1) both API accessed and open source models\nexhibit performance degradation in long-context generation scenarios, ranging\nfrom 1.2% to 47.1%; (2) different series of LLMs exhibit varying trends of\nperformance degradation, with the Gemini-1.5-Flash model showing the least\ndegradation among API accessed models, and the Qwen2 series exhibiting the\nleast degradation in LongGenBench among open source models.",

Recently, methods that combine latent space\nidentification techniques with deep learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders)\nhave shown great potential in describing the dynamical system in the lower\ndimensional latent space, for example, LaSDI, gLaSDI and GPLaSDI.\n  In this paper, a new parametric latent identification of nonlinear dynamics\nneural networks, P-TLDINets, is introduced, which relies on a novel neural\nnetwork structure based on Taylor series expansion and ResNets to learn the\nODEs that govern the reduced space dynamics. During the training process,\nTaylor series-based Latent Dynamic Neural Networks (TLDNets) and identified\nequations are trained simultaneously to generate a smoother latent space. In\norder to facilitate the parameterised study, a $k$-nearest neighbours (KNN)\nmethod based on an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation scheme is\nintroduced to predict the identified ODE coefficients using local information.\nCompared to other latent dynamics identification methods based on autoencoders,\nP-TLDINets remain the interpretability of the model. Additionally, it\ncircumvents the building of explicit autoencoders, avoids dependency on\nspecific grids, and features a more lightweight structure, which is easy to\ntrain with high generalisation capability and accuracy.

Alarmingly,\nrecent advancements in dementia classification make it possible for adversaries\nto violate affected individuals' privacy and infer their sensitive condition\nfrom speech transcriptions. Existing obfuscation methods in text have never\nbeen applied for dementia and depend on the availability of large labeled\ndatasets which are challenging to collect for sensitive medical attributes. In\nthis work, we bridge this research gap and tackle the above issues by\nleveraging Large-Language-Models (LLMs) with diverse prompt designs (zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and knowledge-based) to obfuscate dementia in speech transcripts. Our\nevaluation shows that LLMs are more effective dementia obfuscators compared to\ncompeting methods. However, they have billions of parameters which renders them\nhard to train, store and share, and they are also fragile suffering from\nhallucination, refusal and contradiction effects among others. To further\nmitigate these, we propose a novel method, DiDOTS. DiDOTS distills knowledge\nfrom LLMs using a teacher-student paradigm and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\nDiDOTS has one order of magnitude fewer parameters compared to its teacher LLM\nand can be fine-tuned using three orders of magnitude less parameters compared\nto full fine-tuning. Our evaluation shows that compared to prior work DiDOTS\nretains the performance of LLMs achieving 1.3x and 2.2x improvement in privacy\nperformance on two datasets, while humans rate it as better in preserving\nutility even when compared to state-of-the-art paraphrasing models.",

That is, a triple consisting of a set of objects, $G$,\na set of attributes, $M$, and an incidence relation $I$ on $G \\times M$. A\n\\textit{concept} is then modelled as a pair consisting of a set of objects (the\n\\textit{extent}), and a set of shared attributes (the \\textit{intent}).\nImplications in FCA describe how one set of attributes follows from another.\nThe semantics of these implications closely resemble that of logical\nconsequence in classical logic. In that sense, it describes a monotonic\nconditional. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we introduce\na non-monotonic conditional between sets of attributes, which assumes a\npreference over the set of objects. We show that this conditional gives rise to\na consequence relation that is consistent with the postulates for\nnon-monotonicty proposed by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor (commonly referred to\nas the KLM postulates). We argue that our contribution establishes a strong\ncharacterisation of non-monotonicity in FCA. Typical concepts represent\nconcepts where the intent aligns with expectations from the extent, allowing\nfor an exception-tolerant view of concepts. To this end, we show that the set\nof all typical concepts is a meet semi-lattice of the original concept lattice.\nThis notion of typical concepts is a further introduction of KLM-style\ntypicality into FCA, and is foundational towards developing an algebraic\nstructure representing a concept lattice of prototypical concepts.",

    "abstract": "In 1880, Stokes examined an incompressible irrotational periodic traveling\nwater wave under the influence of gravity and conjectured the existence of an\nextreme wave with a corner of $120^{\\circ}$ at the crest. The first rigorous\nproof of the conjecture was given by Amick, Fraenkel and Toland, as well as by\nPlotnikov independently via the Nekrasov integral equation. In the early 2010s,\nWeiss and Varvarucva revisited the conjecture by applying a new geometric\nmethod, which provided an affirmative answer to the conjecture without\nrequiring structural assumptions such as the isolation of the stagnation\npoints, the symmetry and the monotonicity of the free surface that were\nnecessary in the previous works.\n  The main purpose of this paper is to establish the validity of the Stokes\nconjecture in the context of compressible gravity water waves. More precisely,\nwe prove that a sharp crest forms near each stagnation point of a compressible\ngravity water wave with an included angle of $120^{\\circ}$, which gives a first\nproof to the compressible counterpart of the classical conjecture by Stokes in\n1880.\n  The central aspect of our approach is the discovery of a new monotonicity\nformula for quasilinear free boundary problems of the Bernoulli-type. Another\nobservation is the introduction of a new nonlinear frequency formula, along\nwith a compensated compactness argument for the compressible Euler system. The\ndeveloped monotonicity formula enables us to do blow-up analysis at each\nstagnation point and helps us obtain the singular profile of the free surface\nnear each stagnation points. The degenerate stagnation points can be further\nanalyzed with the help of the compensated compactness argument using the\nfrequency formula.",

In this work, we propose a\ndual-branch adapted SAM framework, named DB-SAM, that strives to effectively\nbridge this domain gap. Our dual-branch adapted SAM contains two branches in\nparallel: a ViT branch and a convolution branch. The ViT branch incorporates a\nlearnable channel attention block after each frozen attention block, which\ncaptures domain-specific local features. On the other hand, the convolution\nbranch employs a light-weight convolutional block to extract domain-specific\nshallow features from the input medical image. To perform cross-branch feature\nfusion, we design a bilateral cross-attention block and a ViT convolution\nfusion block, which dynamically combine diverse information of two branches for\nmask decoder. Extensive experiments on large-scale medical image dataset with\nvarious 3D and 2D medical segmentation tasks reveal the merits of our proposed\ncontributions.

The present study explores the\nresponse of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels\nranging from -5% to 5%.

The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted\nantiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net\nmagnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic\nspin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in\ncontrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by\noctahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn\n$d$ states.

The study is\nbased on a rich set of project-level data on FDI-generated jobs. It utilizes a\nlabor demand function estimated through GMM estimator to account for\nendogeneity. Results indicate that forward GVC participation significantly\nboosts FDI-related job creation by enhancing domestic value-added and\nproduction capacity. However, this effect is moderated by sector-specific\ncharacteristics such as productivity or wages. Conversely, backward GVC\nparticipation, characterized by reliance on foreign inputs, generally reduces\nFDI-generated jobs due to lower domestic labor requirements and diminished\ncompetitiveness. Despite this, the negative impact of backward GVC\nparticipation on employment becomes less significant when regional\ndiversification is considered, highlighting the importance of regional factors\nlike infrastructure and skilled labor. The study also finds that the impact of\nGVC participation on employment varies with EU membership status and sectoral\ncharacteristics, with old EU member states and high-tech sectors benefiting\nmore from forward GVC integration.

Thus, in reality, the space overhead and the noise\nthreshold would depend on the level of gate parallelization. In this paper, we\nobtain an analytical lower bound on the required space overhead in terms of the\nlevel of parallelization for an error correction framework that has more error\ncorrection capability than the existing ones.

In comparison to the known lower bounds\nwhich assume full gate parallelization, our bound is provably strictly larger\ndespite allowing more capability to the error correction framework. This shows\nthe steep price to be paid for lack of gate parallelization.

Liquid noise trades\nconsistency for greater flexibility without resolution limitations. The core\nconcepts also allow other applications such as relighting, seamless upscaling,\nand improved video style transfer. Furthermore, an exploration of the VAE\nembedding used for latent diffusion models is performed, resulting in\ninteresting theoretical insights such as a method for human-interpretable\nlatent spaces.",

While adding new participants to a\nshared model does not pose great technical hurdles, the removal of a\nparticipant and their related information contained in the shared model remains\na challenge. To address this problem, federated unlearning has emerged as a\ncritical research direction, seeking to remove information from globally\ntrained models without harming the model performance on the remaining data.\nMost modern federated unlearning methods use costly approaches such as the use\nof remaining clients data to retrain the global model or methods that would\nrequire heavy computation on client or server side. We introduce Contribution\nDampening (ConDa), a framework that performs efficient unlearning by tracking\ndown the parameters which affect the global model for each client and performs\nsynaptic dampening on the parameters of the global model that have privacy\ninfringing contributions from the forgetting client. Our technique does not\nrequire clients data or any kind of retraining and it does not put any\ncomputational overhead on either the client or server side. We perform\nexperiments on multiple datasets and demonstrate that ConDa is effective to\nforget a client's data. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and\nCIFAR100 datasets, ConDa proves to be the fastest federated unlearning method,\noutperforming the nearest state of the art approach by at least 100x. Our\nemphasis is on the non-IID Federated Learning setting, which presents the\ngreatest challenge for unlearning. Additionally, we validate ConDa's robustness\nthrough backdoor and membership inference attacks. We envision this work as a\ncrucial component for FL in adhering to legal and ethical requirements.",

We find that a too-large performance gap can hamper the\ntraining process, which is also verified in recent studies. To address this, we\npropose a Gap Preserving Distillation (GPD) method that trains an additional\ndynamic teacher model from scratch along with training the student to bridge\nthis gap. In this way, it becomes possible to maintain a reasonable performance\ngap between teacher and student during the whole distillation process. To\nfurther strengthen distillation from the dynamic teacher to the student, we\ndevelop a hard strategy by enforcing them to share parameters and encouraging\nparameter inheritance. Besides hard strategy, we also build the soft\nbidirectional mappings between them which are built on an Inverse\nReparameterization (IR) method and a Channel-Branch Reparameterization (CBR)\nstrategy. We highlight that our IR is able to initialize a larger dynamic\nteacher with an arbitrary expansion ratio, while preserving exactly the same\naccuracy as the given student model. In this way, it guarantees that the\ndynamic teacher and student start from the same point and avoid a too large gap\nin early stage of training. As for our CBR, with parameter-sharing, it directly\nextracts an effective student model from the well-learned dynamic teacher\nwithout any post-training, making our method highly flexible for model\ndeployment. In the experiments, GPD significantly outperforms existing\ndistillation methods on top of both CNNs and transformers architectures,\nachieving up to 1.58% accuracy improvement. Interestingly, GPD also generalizes\nwell to the scenarios without a pre-trained teacher, including training from\nscratch and fine-tuning, yielding a large improvement of 1.80% and 0.89% on\nResNet18, respectively.",

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel\nprompt compression method, namely Reading To Compressing (R2C), utilizing the\nFusion-in-Decoder (FiD) architecture to identify the important information in\nthe prompt. Specifically, the cross-attention scores of the FiD are used to\ndiscern essential chunks and sentences from the prompt. R2C effectively\ncaptures the global context without compromising semantic consistency while\ndetouring the necessity of pseudo-labels for training the compressor. Empirical\nresults show that R2C retains key contexts, enhancing the LLM performance by 6%\nin out-of-domain evaluations while reducing the prompt length by 80%.",

In the athermal limit, the two states are connected by a well-defined\njamming transition, near which the solid is marginally stable. A recent\nmechanical response screening theory proposes an additional transition above\njamming, called a plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating anomalous and\nquasi-elastic mechanical behavior. Through numerical inflation simulations in\ntwo dimensions, we show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular\ncorrelations of particle displacements decouple, occurring respectively at the\njamming and plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is characterized by a\npower-law diverging correlation angle and a power-law spectrum of the\ndisplacements along a circle. This work establishes two-step transitions on the\nmechanical properties during ``decompression melting'' of an athermal\nover-jammed amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural melting of\na crystal in two dimensions.

By incorporating higher-order f(R) corrections into\nclassical black hole metrics, we construct regular black hole solutions that\neliminate classical singularities. Advanced canonical ensemble techniques,\nincluding path integral formulations and stability analyses, are employed to\nexamine the thermodynamic stability, phase transitions, and critical phenomena\nof these f(R)-corrected black holes. The results indicate that f(R) corrections\nsignificantly alter the thermodynamic landscape, introducing novel phase\nstructures and stability conditions. Additionally, numerical simulations are\nconducted to visualize the behavior of thermodynamic quantities under varying\nf(R) correction parameters. This work provides deeper insights into the\ninterplay between modified gravity effects and black hole thermodynamics,\ncontributing to the broader understanding of gravitational phenomena in strong\ngravitational fields.",

To address the challenges of scale and complexity\nin medical tasks, several variants of U-Net have been proposed. In particular,\nmethods based on Vision Transformer (ViT), represented by Swin UNETR, have\ngained widespread attention in recent years. However, these improvements often\nfocus on the encoder, overlooking the crucial role of the decoder in optimizing\nsegmentation details. This design imbalance limits the potential for further\nenhancing segmentation performance. To address this issue, we analyze the roles\nof various decoder components, including upsampling method, skip connection,\nand feature extraction module, as well as the shortcomings of existing methods.\nConsequently, we propose Swin DER (i.e., Swin UNETR Decoder Enhanced and\nRefined) by specifically optimizing the design of these three components. Swin\nDER performs upsampling using learnable interpolation algorithm called offset\ncoordinate neighborhood weighted up sampling (Onsampling) and replaces\ntraditional skip connection with spatial-channel parallel attention gate (SCP\nAG). Additionally, Swin DER introduces deformable convolution along with\nattention mechanism in the feature extraction module of the decoder.

Concerns over collective effects have,\ntherefore, risen, particularly in the transverse planes, since the vacuum\nchamber dimensions tend to be reduced as a way to achieve a stronger focusing\nforce on the beam. In this article, we present numerical studies on transverse\nbeam instabilities, both in the single- and multibunch regimes, in the SOLEIL\nII booster as an example of a low-emittance booster. We show that Landau\ndamping is an efficient mechanism for suppressing both transverse single-bunch\nand coupled-bunch instabilities. We also prove that the damping in the\nlongitudinal plane can diffuse to the transverse plane and limit the transverse\nemittance growth. Moreover, we have discovered that the beam can exhibit\nsawtooth instability at high energy and that broad-band impedance is one of the\nkey factors in suppressing transverse coupled-bunch instability.",

Generally, the SS-OCT captured fringe is linear in\nwavelength space and if Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is applied to\nextract depth-resolved spectral information, the resultant images are blurred\ndue to the broadened Point Spread Function (PSF). Thus, the recorded wavelength\nspace fringe is to be scaled to uniform grid in wavenumber (k) space using\nk-linearization and calibration involving interpolations which may result in\nloss of information along with increased system complexity. Another challenge\nin OCT is the speckle noise, inherent in the low coherence interferometry-based\nsystems. Hence, we propose a systematic design methodology WAVE-UNET to\nreconstruct the high-quality OCT images directly from the {\\lambda}-space to\nreduce the complexity. The novel design paradigm surpasses the linearization\nprocedures and uses DL to enhance the realism and quality of raw\n{\\lambda}-space scans.

As natural extensions of SNL, we further study\nthe computational complexity of its monotone and optimization versions,\nrespectively called MonoSNL and MAXSNL. While SNL does not enjoy the dichotomy\ntheorem unless L$=$NL, we prove the dichotomy theorem for MonoSNL.

In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent\nresistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a\nfundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement\nwhich yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the\nfilm thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\\rho$, in the 1-10 nm\nthickness range, increases exponentially as $\\rho \\sim \\exp(const/L^{1/2})$\nupon decreasing the film thickness $L$.

The drops present a pancake-like initial shape,\ngradually converging towards a spherical one under surface tension effects.\nThree drop retraction regimes are observed: capillary-inertial; mixed\ncapillary-inertio-viscous; and capillary-viscous. In the first regime, the\nretraction is essentially driven by a competition between capillary pressure\nand inertial stresses, which induces a complex flow with equivalent shear,\nuniaxial and biaxial components. As the viscous stress becomes comparable to\nthe capillary and the inertial stresses, the second regime emerges while\nshear-based deformations tend to vanish. Lastly, the third regime is dominated\nby a balance between capillary and viscous stresses, essentially exhibiting\naxial deformation. These physical features are underlined through multiphase\nthree-dimensional numerical simulations and analysed in light of retraction\ndynamics, energy transfer and scaling laws. Our results are rationalised in a\ntwo-dimensional diagram linking the drop retraction time with the observed\nretraction regimes through a single dimensionless parameter combining\ncapillary, inertial, viscous and geometrical effects, i.e., the retraction\nnumber.",

    "abstract": "Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the\nconformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the presence of attractive\ncrowders of varying sizes. For weakly self-attractive polymers, larger crowders\ninduce a transition from an extended state to a bridging-crowder-induced\ncollapse (CB phase) at lower polymer-crowder interaction strengths. Similarly,\nfor strongly self-attractive polymers, a transition from a crowder-excluded\ncollapse (CI phase) to the CB phase occurs with larger crowders and stronger\npolymer-crowder attraction. The simulations reveal that the collapsed states in\nboth weakly and strongly self-attractive polymers are identical when small\nbridging crowders are involved. Near the transition threshold for weakly\nself-attractive polymers, increasing crowder size leads to complex transitions,\nincluding collapse, extension, and re-collapse. Additionally, a confined\ncollapse (CC phase) is observed, where the polymer is confined to interstitial\nspaces among large crowders. Strongly self-attractive polymers show similar\ntransitions, but only with smaller crowders, as larger crowders suppress these\nchanges. These findings underscore the crucial influence of crowder size on the\nconformational behavior of neutral polymers, especially under varying degrees\nof polymer-crowder interaction.",

This paper examines the effectiveness of blob\nsharing based on real-world data collected approximately six months after the\nimplementation of EIP-4844. By simulating cost changes using a simple blob\nsharing format, we demonstrate that blob sharing can substantially improve the\ncosts and DA service quality for small rollups, effectively resolving their\ndilemma.

We first demonstrate\nthat MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing (CS) formulation, albeit\nwith an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this\nincreased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a\nlow-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel\nestimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR) for the\nMC-aware estimation, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing\nmatrices. This method achieves estimation accuracy close to the direct MC-aware\nCS method with less overall computational complexity. Furthermore, we consider\nthe joint optimization of RIS configuration, base station precoding, and user\ncombining in a single-user MIMO system. We employ an alternating optimization\nstrategy to optimize these three beamformers. The primary challenge lies in\noptimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem\nnon-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based\non the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series expansion.\nWithin the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously\nsatisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration\ndirection.

Preliminary experiments demonstrate that PTFS\nachieves better pre-training performance, while CPT has lower training cost.\nMoreover, their performance and training cost gaps widen progressively with\nversion updates. To investigate the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, we\nanalyze the effect of learning rate adjustments during the two stages of CPT:\npreparing an initialization checkpoint and continual pre-training based on this\ncheckpoint.

Our paradigm comprises one main path, where we pre-train a\nLLM with the maximal learning rate, and multiple branching paths, each of which\ncorresponds to an update of the LLM with newly-added training data. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our paradigm.\nParticularly, when training four versions of LLMs, our paradigm reduces the\ntotal training cost to 58% compared to PTFS, while maintaining comparable\npre-training performance.",

We propose parameter optimization strategies to\nmaximize the efficiency of the heat engine, as there are multiple ways for the\neffective coupling constant to move toward its critical value. In the normal\nphase of the system, the efficiency can be improved by increasing the\ntemperature ratio of hot-to-cold reservoirs and enhancing spin-mode coupling\nstrength. However, increasing spin-spin coupling strength inhibits the\nimprovement of the efficiency. As the system goes to its critical point, QHE\nefficiency under low-temperature conditions tends to the Carnot limit. In the\nsuperradiant phase, the efficiency approaches the Carnot limit more closely as\nthe cold reservoir's temperature decreases given a constant temperature ratio.\nConversely, when the cold reservoir's temperature rises, the efficiency\nincreases due to a higher ratio of spin-mode coupling strength to mode\nfrequency. If the spinspin coupling strength is constant, increasing the\nhot-to-cold reservoir temperature ratio requires a corresponding increase in\nspin-mode coupling strength to achieve the Carnot efficiency.

To bridge this gap,\nwe aim to unify Multi-lingual, Cross-lingual and Multi-document Summarization\ninto a novel task, i.e., MCMS, which encapsulates the real-world requirements\nall-in-one. Nevertheless, the lack of a benchmark inhibits researchers from\nadequately studying this invaluable problem. To tackle this, we have\nmeticulously constructed the GLOBESUMM dataset by first collecting a wealth of\nmultilingual news reports and restructuring them into event-centric format.\nAdditionally, we introduce the method of protocol-guided prompting for\nhigh-quality and cost-effective reference annotation. In MCMS, we also\nhighlight the challenge of conflicts between news reports, in addition to the\nissues of redundancies and omissions, further enhancing the complexity of\nGLOBESUMM. Through extensive experimental analysis, we validate the quality of\nour dataset and elucidate the inherent challenges of the task. We firmly\nbelieve that GLOBESUMM, given its challenging nature, will greatly contribute\nto the multilingual communities and the evaluation of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we determine the fine-tuning of parameters in $\\mathcal{N} =\n1$ Supersymmetric QCD, discretized on a Euclidean lattice. Our focus is on the\nrenormalization of Yukawa (gluino-quark-squark interactions) and quartic\n(four-squark interactions) couplings. Given that SUSY is broken on the lattice,\nnon-supersymmetric counterterms must be added to the discretized Lagrangian,\nwith coefficients which must be appropriately fine-tuned in order to recover\nSUSY in the continuum limit. To deduce the renormalization factors and the\ncoefficients of the counterterms, we compute the relevant three-point (for the\nYukawa couplings) and four-point Green's functions (for the quartic couplings)\nperturbatively to one-loop and to the lowest order in lattice spacing. Both\ndimensional and lattice regularizations are used to implement the Modified\nMinimal Subtraction scheme. Our lattice formulation employs the Wilson\ndiscretization for gluino and quark fields, the Wilson gauge action for gluons,\nand naive discretization for squark fields. One main difficulty in this study\nlies in the fact that different components of squark fields mix among\nthemselves at the quantum level. Consequently, for an appropriate fine-tuning\nof the couplings, these mixings must be taken into account in the\nrenormalization conditions. All Green's functions and renormalization factors\nexhibit an explicit dependence on the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of\nflavors, $N_f$, and the gauge parameter, $\\alpha$, which are left unspecified.\nThis work follows previous investigations on SQCD and finalizes the one-loop\nfine-tuning of the SQCD action on the lattice, paving the way for numerical\nsimulations of SQCD.",

In\nthis work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding,\nshifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement.

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in online bidding and sleeping bandits, we examine\nthe problem of contextual bandits with cross learning, where the learner\nobserves the loss associated with the action across all possible contexts, not\njust the current round's context. Our focus is on a setting where losses are\nchosen adversarially, and contexts are sampled i.i.d. from a specific\ndistribution. This problem was first studied by Balseiro et al. (2019), who\nproposed an algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret under the assumption\nthat the context distribution is known in advance. However, this assumption is\noften unrealistic. To address this issue, Schneider and Zimmert (2023) recently\nproposed a new algorithm that achieves nearly optimal expected regret. It is\nwell-known that expected regret can be significantly weaker than\nhigh-probability bounds. In this paper, we present a novel, in-depth analysis\nof their algorithm and demonstrate that it actually achieves near-optimal\nregret with high probability. There are steps in the original analysis by\nSchneider and Zimmert (2023) that lead only to an expected bound by nature. In\nour analysis, we introduce several new insights.

Spectral indices derived from millimeter observations are\nused as a common probe for grain size. Converting observed spectral indices\ninto grain sizes is a complex task that involves solving the radiative transfer\nequation, taking into account the disk structure and dust properties. In this\nwork, we ran reference radiative transfer models with known disk properties,\nand generated four synthetic images at wavelengths of 0.8, 1.3, 3, and 7.8 mm,\nrepresenting high-resolution continuum observations. Rings and gaps were\nconsidered in the setup. We fit the synthetic images using the analytic\nsolution of the radiative transfer equation to investigate the circumstances\nunder which the input grain sizes can be recovered. The results show that\nfitting images at only two wavelengths is not sufficient to retrieve the grain\nsize. Fitting three images improves the retrieval of grain size, but the dust\nsurface density is still not well recovered. When taking all of the four images\ninto account, degeneracies between different parameters are highly reduced, and\nconsequently the best-fit grain sizes are consistent with the reference setup\nat almost all radii. We find that the inclination angle has a significant\nimpact on the fitting results. For disks with low inclinations, the analytic\napproach works quite well. However, when the disk is tilted above about 60\ndegree, neither the grain size nor the dust surface density can be constrained,\nas the inclination effect will smooth out all substructures in the radial\nintensity profile of the disk.",

Since scenes often contain\ndiverse visual information across various regions, such as foreground objects,\nbackground elements, and spatial divisions, dealing with these different\nregions poses unique difficulties. In this paper, we define a sketch as some\nsets of B\\'ezier curves because of their smooth and versatile characteristics.\nWe optimize different regions of input scene in multiple rounds. In each\noptimization round, the strokes sampled from the next region can seamlessly be\nintegrated into the sketch generated in the previous optimization round. We\npropose an additional stroke initialization method to ensure the integrity of\nthe scene and the convergence of optimization. A novel CLIP-based Semantic Loss\nand a VGG-based Feature Loss are utilized to guide our multi-round\noptimization. Extensive experimental results on the quality and quantity of the\ngenerated sketches confirm the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond duration transients observed in the\nradio band, with their origin and radiation mechanism remaining unclear to\ndate. Growing evidence indicates that at least some FRBs originate from\nmagnetars and are likely generated within the magnetospheres of these highly\nmagnetized neutron stars. However, a recent study suggested that FRBs\noriginating from magnetar magnetospheres would be scattered by magnetospheric\nelectron--positron pair plasma, making it impossible for them to escape\nsuccessfully. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the scattering effect\ncan be greatly attenuated if the angle between the FRB propagation direction\nand the background magnetic field is $\\sim10^{-2} \\text{ rad}$ or smaller. When\nthe angle is around $10^{-1} \\text{ rad}$, the beaming effect of FRBs becomes\nsignificant in reducing scattering. Such FRBs have small transverse spatial\nsizes, which can help them instantly push the front plasma laterally out of the\nradiation region. This significantly mitigates the FRB-induced two-photon\nannihilation reaction, $\\gamma+\\gamma\\to e^{-}+e^{+}$, which was previously\nregarded as a key factor hindering the propagation of FRBs. A critical\nradiation cone half-opening angle between $10^{-3}-10^{-2}\\text{ rad}$ is found\nfor an FRB with isotropic luminosity $L_{\\text{iso}}\\sim 10^{42}\\text{ erg\ns}^{-1}$ and emitted at a radius $r_{\\text{em}}\\lesssim 10^9\\text{ cm}$ in the\nmagnetosphere of a magnetar. Smaller beaming angles and larger emission radii\ncan be more advantageous for the propagation of FRBs in magnetospheres. Our\nresult supports the scenario that FRBs could originate from magnetar\nmagnetospheres.",

Recently, the Retentive Network (RetNet) in natural language\nprocessing offers a novel approach to this problem with its low-cost inference\ncapabilities. Inspired by this, we apply RetNet to the pluralistic image\ncompletion task in computer vision. We present RetCompletion, a two-stage\nframework. In the first stage, we introduce Bi-RetNet, a bidirectional sequence\ninformation fusion model that integrates contextual information from images.\nDuring inference, we employ a unidirectional pixel-wise update strategy to\nrestore consistent image structures, achieving both high reconstruction quality\nand fast inference speed. In the second stage, we use a CNN for low-resolution\nupsampling to enhance texture details. Experiments on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ\ndemonstrate that our inference speed is 10$\\times$ faster than ICT and\n15$\\times$ faster than RePaint. The proposed RetCompletion significantly\nimproves inference speed and delivers strong performance.",

    "abstract": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in visual\nand language reasoning tasks, they invariably generate flawed responses.\nSelf-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a\npromising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs,\nparticularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely\nunexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs\nduring both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction\nLearning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated\nself-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without\nrelying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a\nrefinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models\nthrough additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses\ndirectly without further refinement.",

    "abstract": "Social balance is a well-established concept in sociology which dictates how\nindividual interactions can lead a population to become one faction of positive\ninteractions or be divided in two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper,\nwe consider a group of large language models (LLMs) and study how, after\ncontinuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three\ndifferent LLM models, we find that achieving social balance depends on (i) the\ntype of interaction; (ii) whether agents consider homophily or influence from\ntheir peers; and (iii) the population size. We characterize how each model\nachieves social balance with different frequency, diversity of positive or\nnegative interactions, and interaction stability across conditions (i) to\n(iii). We show that models achieve different notions of social balance and\njustify their social dynamics differently. Remarkably, the largest model is not\nnecessarily more likely to achieve social balance with more frequency,\nstability, and diversity than the smaller ones.",

Both\nproblems have already been studied over static as well as dynamic graphs.\nThough dispersion and load balancing share some common features, the tools used\nin solving load balancing differ significantly from those used in solving\ndispersion. One of the reasons is that the load balancing problem is introduced\nand studied heavily over graphs where nodes are the processors and work under\nthe message passing model, whereas dispersion is a task for mobile agents to\nachieve on graphs. To bring the (load) balancing aspect in the dispersion\nproblem, we say, mobile agents move to balance themselves as equally as\npossible across the nodes of the graph, instead of stationary nodes sharing\nloads in the load balancing problem. We call it the \\emph{$k$-balanced\ndispersion} problem and study it on dynamic graphs. This is equivalent to the\nload balancing problem considering movable loads in form of the agents.\n  Earlier, on static graphs, the \\emph{$k$-dispersion} problem [TAMC 2019]\naimed for the same by putting an upper bound on the number of agents on each\nnode in the final configuration; however, the absence of a lower bound on the\nnumber of agents in their problem definition hampers the load-balancing aspect,\nas some nodes may end up with no agents in the final configuration.

MicroBooNE has performed searches to test\nhypothetical interpretations of the MiniBooNE low-energy excess, including the\nunderestimation of the photon background or instrinic $\\nu_{e}$ background.\nThis thesis presents MicroBooNE's searches for two neutral current (NC)\nsingle-photon production processes that contribute to the photon background of\nthe MiniBooNE measurement: NC $\\Delta$ resonance production followed by\n$\\Delta$ radiative decay: $\\Delta \\rightarrow N\\gamma$, and NC coherent\nsingle-photon production. Both searches take advantage of boosted decision\ntrees to yield efficient background rejection, and a high-statistic NC $\\pi^0$\nmeasurement to constrain dominant background, and make use of MicroBooNE's\nfirst three years of data. The NC $\\Delta \\rightarrow N\\gamma$ measurement\nyielded a bound on the $\\Delta$ radiative decay process at 2.3 times the\npredicted nominal rate at 90% confidence level (C.L.), disfavoring a candidate\nphoton interpretation of the MiniBooNE low-energy excess as a factor of 3.18\ntimes the nominal NC $\\Delta$ radiative decay rate at the 94.8% C.L.

    "abstract": "A flatband material is a system characterized by energy bands with zero\ndispersion, allowing for the compact localization of wavefunctions in real\nspace. This compact localization significantly enhances inter-particle\ncorrelations and light-matter interactions, leading to notable advancements\nsuch as fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter systems and flat-band\nlasers in photonics. Previous flatband platforms, including twisted bilayer\ngraphene and artificial kagome/Lieb lattices, typically focused on\nnondegenerate flatbands, lacking access to the high degeneracy that can\nfacilitate the localization of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Here, we propose\na general framework to construct highly degenerate flatbands from bound states\nin the continuum (BICs)--a concept originating from quantum theory but\nsignificantly developed in photonics and acoustics in recent years. The\ndegeneracy of flatbands is determined by the number of BICs within each unit\ncell in a lattice. We experimentally validate this approach in two-dimensional\n(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) acoustic crystals, demonstrating flatbands with\n4-fold and 12-fold degeneracies, respectively. The high degeneracy provides\nsufficient internal degrees of freedom, enabling the selective excitation of\nlocalized OAM at any position in any direction. Our results pave the way for\nexploring BIC-constructed flatbands and their localization properties.",

To address this, we scale up the\ninference-time computation by generating multiple reasoning paths and employing\nverifiers to assess and rank the generated outputs by correctness. To\nfacilitate this, we introduce a comprehensive dataset consisting of correct and\nincorrect solutions for math and code tasks, generated by multiple LLMs. This\ndiverse set of solutions enables verifiers to more effectively distinguish and\nrank correct answers from erroneous outputs. The training methods for building\nverifiers were selected based on an extensive comparison of existing\napproaches.

Furthermore, we propose two useful reward strategies to address\npractical challenges specific to the CSC task. Experiments on five public\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves LLM performance,\nenabling them to compete with state-of-the-art domain-general CSC models.",

In the task of predicting large-scale urban parking data,\nexisting research often lacks effective deep learning models and strategies. To\ntackle this challenge, this paper proposes an innovative framework for\npredicting large-scale urban parking graphs leveraging real-time service\ncapabilities, aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of parking\npredictions. Specifically, we introduce a graph attention mechanism that\nassesses the real-time service capabilities of parking lots to construct a\ndynamic parking graph that accurately reflects real preferences in parking\nbehavior. To effectively handle large-scale parking data, this study combines\ngraph coarsening techniques with temporal convolutional autoencoders to achieve\nunified dimension reduction of the complex urban parking graph structure and\nfeatures. Subsequently, we use a spatio-temporal graph convolutional model to\nmake predictions based on the coarsened graph, and a pre-trained\nautoencoder-decoder module restores the predicted results to their original\ndata dimensions, completing the task. Our methodology has been rigorously\ntested on a real dataset from parking lots in Shenzhen. The experimental\nresults indicate that compared to traditional parking prediction models, our\nframework achieves improvements of 46.8\\% and 30.5\\% in accuracy and\nefficiency, respectively.

Taking the Hopf insulator as\na representative example, we show that the change of the Hopf invariant\nrequires the information of wave functions as well as the gapless band\nstructure simultaneously. More explicitly, the description of the Hopf\ninvariant change requires us to trace not only the trajectory of Weyl points\nbut also the evolution of the preimages for two distinct eigenstates. We show\nthat such an unconventional topological phase transition originates from the\nfact that the Hopf invariant is well-defined when all the lower dimensional\ntopological invariants are trivial, which in turn allows us to lift the\nclassifying space of occupied state projectors to the corresponding universal\n2-covering space of wave functions.

It was shown that the use of this basis leads to\nA-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver.\nThe numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical\nsolution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main\ncharacteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution\ncan be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes,\nthereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The\nclassical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With\nincreasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence\norders p is observed.

    "abstract": "After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only\nelectric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed\nthat there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave\nfield which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually\nopposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the\nlight-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the\nelectric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the\nnodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field\nnodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally\nled to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in\na standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic\nenergy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully\nverified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a\nstanding-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical\ndeductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous\ncommon formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original\nmeaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than\nelectric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180\ndegrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the\nlight-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were\nequal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave\nfield.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's\nconclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to\nform interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the\nelectric-field vector on light interacting with substance.",

Although previous methods have demonstrated the\nimportance of relative encodings for effective temporal link prediction,\ncomputational efficiency remains a major concern in constructing these\nencodings. Moreover, existing relative encodings are usually constructed based\non structural connectivity, where temporal information is seldom considered. To\naddress the aforementioned issues, we first analyze existing relative encodings\nand unify them as a function of temporal walk matrices. This unification\nestablishes a connection between relative encodings and temporal walk matrices,\nproviding a more principled way for analyzing and designing relative encodings.\nBased on this analysis, we propose a new temporal graph neural network called\nTPNet, which introduces a temporal walk matrix that incorporates the time decay\neffect to simultaneously consider both temporal and structural information.\nMoreover, TPNet designs a random feature propagation mechanism with theoretical\nguarantees to implicitly maintain the temporal walk matrices, which improves\nthe computation and storage efficiency. Experimental results on 13 benchmark\ndatasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TPNet, where TPNet\noutperforms other baselines on most datasets and achieves a maximum speedup of\n$33.3 \\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline.

However, it remains an open question whether the default\nEuclidean space is the most suitable choice for embedding tokens in LLMs. In\nthis study, we first investigate the non-Euclidean characteristics of LLMs. Our\nfindings reveal that token frequency follows a power-law distribution, with\nhigh-frequency tokens clustering near the origin and low-frequency tokens\npositioned farther away. Additionally, token embeddings exhibit a high degree\nof hyperbolicity, indicating a latent tree-like structure in the embedding\nspace. Building on the observation, we propose to efficiently fine-tune LLMs in\nhyperbolic space to better exploit the underlying complex structures. However,\nwe found that this fine-tuning in hyperbolic space cannot be achieved with\nnaive application of exponential and logarithmic maps, when the embedding and\nweight matrices both reside in Euclidean space. To address this technique\nissue, we introduce a new method called hyperbolic low-rank efficient\nfine-tuning, HypLoRA, that performs low-rank adaptation directly on the\nhyperbolic manifold, avoiding the cancellation effect caused by the exponential\nand logarithmic maps, thus preserving the hyperbolic modeling capabilities.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that HypLoRA significantly\nenhances the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks, particularly for complex\nreasoning problems.

    "abstract": "Various imaging modalities are used in patient diagnosis, each offering\nunique advantages and valuable insights into anatomy and pathology. Computed\nTomography (CT) is crucial in diagnostics, providing high-resolution images for\nprecise internal organ visualization. CT's ability to detect subtle tissue\nvariations is vital for diagnosing diseases like lung cancer, enabling early\ndetection and accurate tumor assessment. However, variations in CT scanner\nmodels and acquisition protocols introduce significant variability in the\nextracted radiomic features, even when imaging the same patient. This\nvariability poses considerable challenges for downstream research and clinical\nanalysis, which depend on consistent and reliable feature extraction. Current\nmethods for medical image feature extraction, often based on supervised\nlearning approaches, including GAN-based models, face limitations in\ngeneralizing across different imaging environments. In response to these\nchallenges, we propose LTDiff++, a multiscale latent diffusion model designed\nto enhance feature extraction in medical imaging. The model addresses\nvariability by standardizing non-uniform distributions in the latent space,\nimproving feature consistency. LTDiff++ utilizes a UNet++ encoder-decoder\narchitecture coupled with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(DDPM) at the latent bottleneck to achieve robust feature extraction and\nstandardization. Extensive empirical evaluations on both patient and phantom CT\ndatasets demonstrate significant improvements in image standardization, with\nhigher Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) across multiple radiomic\nfeature categories. Through these advancements, LTDiff++ represents a promising\nsolution for overcoming the inherent variability in medical imaging data,\noffering improved reliability and accuracy in feature extraction processes.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of such improvements remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, we offer a novel explanation from the perspective\nof the representation space (i.e., the space of the features obtained at the\npenultimate layer). Our investigation first reveals that the decision regions\nin the representation space form cone-like shapes around the origin after\ntraining regardless of the presence of regularization. However, applying\nregularization causes changes in the distribution of features (or\nrepresentation vectors). The magnitudes of the representation vectors are\nreduced and subsequently the cosine similarities between the representation\nvectors and the class centers (minimal loss points for each class) become\nhigher, which acts as a central mechanism inducing improved calibration and\nrobustness. Our findings provide new insights into the characteristics of the\nhigh-dimensional representation space in relation to training and\nregularization using soft labels.",

    "abstract": "Tungsten (W) is considered a leading candidate for structural and functional\nmaterials in future fusion energy devices. The most attractive properties of\ntungsten for magnetic and inertial fusion energy reactors are its high melting\npoint, high thermal conductivity, low sputtering yield, and low long-term\ndisposal radioactive footprint. However, tungsten also presents a very low\nfracture toughness, primarily associated with inter-granular failure and bulk\nplasticity, limiting its applications. In recent years, several families of\ntungsten-based alloys have been explored to overcome the aforementioned\nlimitations of pure tungsten. These might include tungsten-based high-entropy\nalloys (W-HEAs) and the so-called tungsten-based \"smart alloys\". In this work,\nwe present a computational approach that uses first-principles DFT electronic\nstructure calculations to understand the effect of the chemical environment on\ntungsten-based alloys. In particular, we compared the Special Quasi-random\nStructure (SQS) and the DFT-coupled Monte Carlo (MC-DFT) methods when\ninvestigating the short-range order and elastic properties of two equimolar\nWCrTaTi and WVTaTi W-HEAs, and two WCrTi and WCrY W-SAs. We found that\nstructures after MC-DFT calculation have lower cohesive energies than SQS\nstructures, with shorter lattice constants, and large elastic properties\nvalues.

Recently, large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising\ncandidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the\nmodel size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions\nthat agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL\n(YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning\ncapabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in\ncooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires\none time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state\ninterpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy\ntraining process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time\nassociated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained\ndecentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate\nindependently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different\nenvironments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL\nalgorithms.",

Thus, traditional video-based methods often\nstruggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer a promising alternative.

    "abstract": "In this paper, an enhanced unified differential evolution algorithm, named\nUDE-III, is presented for real parameter-constrained optimization problems\n(COPs). The proposed UDE-III is a significantly enhanced version of the\nImproved UDE (i.e., IUDE or UDE-II), which secured the 1st rank in the CEC 2018\ncompetition on real parameter COPs. To design UDE-III, we extensively targeted\nthe weaknesses of UDE-II. Specifically, UDE-III uses three trial vector\ngeneration strategies - DE/rand/1, DE/current-to-rand/1, and\nDE/current-to-pbest/1. It is based on a dual population approach, and for each\ngeneration, it divides the current population into two sub-populations. In the\ntop sub-population, it employs all three trial vector generation strategies on\neach target vector. On the other hand, the bottom sub-population employs\nstrategy adaptation and one trial vector generation strategy is implemented on\neach target vector. The mutation operation in UDE-III is based on ranking-based\nmutation. Further, it employs the parameter adaptation principle of SHADE. The\nconstraint handling principle in UDE-III is based on a combination of the\nfeasibility rule and epsilon-constraint handling technique. We observed that\nstagnation is a major weakness of UDE-II. To overcome this weakness, we took\ninspiration from the best-discarded vector selection (BDVS) strategy proposed\nin the literature and integrated a novel strategy in UDE-III to address\nstagnation. Additionally, unlike UDE-II, UDE-III considers the size of the two\nsub-populations to be a design element. Moreover, in comparison to UDE-II,\nUDE-III improves upon the strategy adaptation, ranking-based mutation, and the\nconstraint handling technique. The proposed UDE-III algorithm is tested on the\n28 benchmark 30D problems provided for the CEC 2024 competition on real\nparameter COPs. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of UDE-III\nover UDE-II.",

For ReLU networks, we characterize this bias through a variational\nproblem in function space. Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary\ngradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an\nintractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections.\nWe further introduce scaled potentials and show that for these, mirror flow\nstill exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For networks with\nabsolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials\ninduces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS\nnorm. A takeaway is that whereas the parameter initialization determines how\nstrongly the curvature of the learned function is penalized at different\nlocations of the input space, the scaled potential determines how the different\nmagnitudes of the curvature are penalized.",

The SEA utilizes semantic graph maps that intricately delineate the\nrelationships between places and objects, thereby enriching the navigational\ncontext. These maps are constructed from image observations and capture visual\nlandmarks as sparsely encoded nodes within the environment. The SEA integrates\nmultiple semantic maps from various environments, retaining a memory of\nplace-object relationships, which proves invaluable for tasks such as visual\nlocalization and navigation. We developed navigation frameworks that\neffectively leverage the SEA, and we evaluated these frameworks through visual\nlocalization and object-goal navigation tasks. Our SEA-based localization\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods, accurately identifying\nlocations from single query images. Experimental results in Habitat scenarios\nshow that our method not only achieves a success rate of 39.0%, an improvement\nof 12.4% over the current state-of-the-art, but also maintains robustness under\nnoisy odometry and actuation conditions, all while keeping computational costs\nlow.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the interplay between the geometric and topological\nproperties of spherically symmetric black hole metrics within Einstein gravity,\nemphasizing implications for Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC). By analyzing\nmetric functions, scalar fields, and the cosmological constant, we reveal how\nthese black hole solutions are intrinsically linked to the underlying spacetime\ntopology. We establish the uniqueness of a general black hole solution that\nsupports BEC and demonstrate the impossibility of BEC in Kerr black holes.\nAdditionally, through Laurent series expansions, residue calculations, winding\nnumbers, and contour integrals, we confirm the algebraic and dimensional\nconsistency between double Kerr black hole collisions and specific scalar field\nblack hole solutions. This work uncovers fundamental connections in black hole\ninteractions, providing a robust mathematical framework for understanding the\ndynamics of complex black hole systems and their interactions with scalar\nfields.",

    "abstract": "The part-whole relational property endowed by Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has\nbeen known successful for camouflaged object detection due to its segmentation\nintegrity. However, the previous Expectation Maximization (EM) capsule routing\nalgorithm with heavy computation and large parameters obstructs this trend. The\nprimary attribution behind lies in the pixel-level capsule routing.\nAlternatively, in this paper, we propose a novel mamba capsule routing at the\ntype level. Specifically, we first extract the implicit latent state in mamba\nas capsule vectors, which abstract type-level capsules from pixel-level\nversions. These type-level mamba capsules are fed into the EM routing algorithm\nto get the high-layer mamba capsules, which greatly reduce the computation and\nparameters caused by the pixel-level capsule routing for part-whole\nrelationships exploration. On top of that, to retrieve the pixel-level capsule\nfeatures for further camouflaged prediction, we achieve this on the basis of\nthe low-layer pixel-level capsules with the guidance of the correlations from\nadjacent-layer type-level mamba capsules. Extensive experiments on three widely\nused COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-arts.

This paper investigates explanations for a\nstructured prediction task called ``text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing'', which\ntranslates a natural language question into a structured query language (SQL)\nprogram. In this task setting, we designed three levels of model explanation,\neach exposing a different amount of the model's decision-making details (called\n``algorithm transparency''), and investigated how different model explanations\ncould potentially yield different impacts on the user experience. Our study\nwith $\\sim$100 participants shows that (1) the low-/high-transparency\nexplanations often lead to less/more user reliance on the model decisions,\nwhereas the medium-transparency explanations strike a good balance. We also\nshow that (2) only the medium-transparency participant group was able to engage\nfurther in the interaction and exhibit increasing performance over time, and\nthat (3) they showed the least changes in trust before and after the study.",
