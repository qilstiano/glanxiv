Via\nthe method of moments, we show that the transmitted message converges in\ndistribution to the standard continuous uniform random variable on the interval\n[0,1]. It is remarkable that the limiting distribution is the same for all $p$,\nindicating robustness in the performance of arithmetic coding across an entire\nfamily of bit distributions.

However, conventional dimensionality reduction techniques are\ntypically limited to known and constant parameters, inefficient for nonlinear\nand chaotic dynamics, and uninformed to the actual system behavior. In this\nwork, we propose sensor-driven SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks for Reduced\nOrder Modeling (SHRED-ROM). Specifically, we consider the composition of a long\nshort-term memory network, which encodes the temporal dynamics of limited\nsensor data in multiple scenarios, and a shallow decoder, which reconstructs\nthe corresponding high-dimensional states. SHRED-ROM is a robust decoding-only\nstrategy that circumvents the numerically unstable approximation of an inverse\nwhich is required by encoding-decoding schemes. To enhance computational\nefficiency and memory usage, the full-order state snapshots are reduced by,\ne.g., proper orthogonal decomposition, allowing for compressive training of the\nnetworks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. Through applications on chaotic\nand nonlinear fluid dynamics, we show that SHRED-ROM (i) accurately\nreconstructs the state dynamics for new parameter values starting from limited\nfixed or mobile sensors, independently on sensor placement, (ii) can cope with\nboth physical, geometrical and time-dependent parametric dependencies, while\nbeing agnostic to their actual values, (iii) can accurately estimate unknown\nparameters, and (iv) can deal with different data sources, such as\nhigh-fidelity simulations, coupled fields and videos.",

Efficient light outcoupling from the racetrack resonator provides\nmore than 100 mW of continuous-wave output power at room temperature, with beam\nquality on par with that of Fabry--Perot lasers. Experimental waveform\nreconstruction confirms that the combs are frequency-modulated, rather than\namplitude-modulated (as in active mode-locking). We show excellent agreement\nbetween the experimental waveforms and numerical simulations, which are based\non a reduced Maxwell--Bloch model of the laser and include fast gain dynamics,\nfinite group velocity dispersion, and large Kerr nonlinearity. Furthermore, our\noptimized device architecture -- featuring thick Si3N4 passivation and reduced\nparasitic capacitance -- enables modulation bandwidths exceeding 10 GHz.\nCombined with high output powers and the potential for monolithic integration\nof multiple ring lasers and waveguide couplers, these advances pave the way to\nfully integrated dual-comb spectrometers.",

In\nthis fully analytical work, we demonstrate that the collective vibrations of a\nmolecular ensemble under VSC execute a beating with a period inversely\nproportional to the collective vacuum Rabi splitting. Significantly, this\ncollective beating is imprinted on the local dynamics and resonantly suppresses\nindividual molecular vibrations when a fraction of molecules are vibrationally\nexcited, as in activated complexes formed in chemical reactions. This emergent\nbeating occurs on significantly longer time scales than the individual\nmolecular vibration or the cavity field oscillation period, peaking at the\ncavity-molecule resonance, consistent with polaritonic chemistry experiments.\nThe cavity mediates an energy exchange between excited and ground-state\nmolecules, affecting the dynamics of the entire ensemble. These findings\nsuggest that the dynamics in polaritonic chemical reactions may not be in full\nequilibrium. In the ultra-strong coupling regime, we find that the local\nvibrations are modified by the cavity even at short time scales. Our analytical\nmodel offers insights into how collective VSC can dampen local molecular\nvibrations at resonance, potentially altering chemical reactivity.",

Future link prediction, edge\nclassification, relation generation, and other downstream tasks on DyTAGs\nrequire powerful representations that encode structural, temporal, and textual\ninformation. Although graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at handling structured\ndata, encoding temporal information within dynamic graphs remains a significant\nchallenge. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Knowledge Distillation for\nDynamic Text Attributed Graph (LKD4DyTAG) with temporal encoding to address\nthese challenges. We use a simple, yet effective approach to encode temporal\ninformation in edges so that graph convolution can simultaneously capture both\ntemporal and structural information in the hidden representations. To leverage\nLLM's text processing capabilities for learning richer representations on\nDyTAGs, we distill knowledge from LLM-driven edge representations (based on a\nneighborhood's text attributes) into saptio-temporal representations using a\nlightweight GNN model that encodes temporal and structural information. The\nobjective of knowledge distillation enables the GNN to learn representations\nthat more effectively encode the available structural, temporal, and textual\ninformation in DyTAG.

While maintaining this relevance, platforms seek\nopportunities to maximize revenue through search result adjustments. To address\nthe trade-off between relevance and revenue, we propose the $\\mathsf{RARe}$\n($\\textbf{R}$aising $\\textbf{A}$dvertisement $\\textbf{Re}$venue) framework.\n$\\mathsf{RARe}$ stacks a click model and a reranking model. We train the\n$\\mathsf{RARe}$ framework with a loss function to find revenue and relevance\ntrade-offs. According to our experience, the click model is crucial in the\n$\\mathsf{RARe}$ framework. We propose and compare two different click models\nthat take into account the context of items in a search result. The first click\nmodel is a Gradient-Boosting Decision Tree with Concatenation (GBDT-C), which\nincludes a context in the traditional GBDT model for click prediction. The\nsecond model, SAINT-Q, adapts the Sequential Attention model to capture\ninfluences between search results. Our experiments indicate that the proposed\nclick models outperform baselines and improve the overall quality of our\nframework. Experiments on the industrial dataset, which will be released\npublicly, show $\\mathsf{RARe}$'s significant revenue improvements while\npreserving a high relevance.",

Kostochka et al. first conjectured\nthat if a bipartite graph $G=(X, Y)$ satisfies a slightly weaker version of the\ndouble Hall property, then $G$ contains a cycle that covers all vertices of\n$X$. They verified their conjecture for $|X| \\leq 6$. In this paper, we extend\ntheir result to $|X| = 7$. Later, Salia conjectured that every bipartite graph\nsatisfying the double Hall property has a cycle covering all vertices of $X$.\nWe show that Salia's conjecture is almost equivalent to a much weaker\nconjecture requiring vertices in $Y$ to have high degrees. By extending a\nresult of Bar\\'at et al., we also show that Salia's conjecture holds for some\ngraphs where the vertices of $Y$ have degree either $2$ or very high.

The MiniBooNE anomaly has garnered\nsignificant attention over the past 20 years including previous MicroBooNE\ninvestigations into both anomalous electron and photon excesses, but its origin\nstill remains unclear. In this letter, we provide the first direct test of dark\nsector models in which dark neutrinos, produced through neutrino-induced\nscattering, decay into missing energy and visible $e^+e^-$ pairs comprising the\nMiniBooNE anomaly. Many such models have recently gained traction as a viable\nsolution to the anomaly while evading past bounds. Using an exposure of $6.87\n\\times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target in the Booster Neutrino Beam, we implement a\nselection targeting forward-going, coherently produced $e^+e^-$ events. After\nunblinding, we observe 95 events, which we compare with the constrained\nbackground-only prediction of $69.7 \\pm 17.3$. This analysis sets the world's\nfirst direct limits on these dark sector models and, at the 95\\% confidence\nlevel, excludes the majority of the parameter space viable as a solution to the\nMiniBooNE anomaly.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the development and testing of a conversational speech\nsystem designed for robots to detect speech biomarkers indicative of cognitive\nimpairments in people living with dementia (PLwD). The system integrates a\nbackend Python WebSocket server and a central core module with a large language\nmodel (LLM) fine-tuned for dementia to process user input and generate robotic\nconversation responses in real-time in less than 1.5 seconds. The frontend user\ninterface, a Progressive Web App (PWA), displays information and biomarker\nscore graphs on a smartphone in real-time to human users (PLwD, caregivers,\nclinicians). Six speech biomarkers based on the existing literature - Altered\nGrammar, Pragmatic Impairments, Anomia, Disrupted Turn-Taking, Slurred\nPronunciation, and Prosody Changes - were developed for the robot conversation\nsystem using two datasets, one that included conversations of PLwD with a human\nclinician (DementiaBank dataset) and one that included conversations of PLwD\nwith a robot (Indiana dataset). We also created a composite speech biomarker\nthat combined all six individual biomarkers into a single score. The speech\nsystem's performance was first evaluated on the DementiaBank dataset showing\nmoderate correlation with MMSE scores, with the composite biomarker score\noutperforming individual biomarkers. Analysis of the Indiana dataset revealed\nhigher and more variable biomarker scores, suggesting potential differences due\nto study populations (e.g. severity of dementia) and the conversational\nscenario (human-robot conversations are different from human-human). The\nfindings underscore the need for further research on the impact of\nconversational scenarios on speech biomarkers and the potential clinical\napplications of robotic speech systems.",

However, training solely with task rewards introduces\ntwo major challenges: these rewards are prone to exploitation (reward hacking),\nand the exploration process can lack sufficient direction. To address these\nissues, we propose a two-stage training pipeline. First, we introduce the\nUnsupervised Actuator Net (UAN), which leverages real-world data to bridge the\nsim-to-real gap for complex actuation mechanisms without requiring access to\ntorque sensing. UAN mitigates reward hacking by ensuring that the learned\nbehaviors remain robust and transferable. Second, we use a pre-training and\nfine-tuning strategy that leverages reference trajectories as initial hints to\nguide exploration. With these innovations, our robot athlete learns to lift,\nthrow, and drag with remarkable fidelity from simulation to reality.",

    "abstract": "There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners,\nwhich are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some\nnodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete\nunderstanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number\nof faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there\nhave been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch,\nlightness, and number of faults tolerated.\n  We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners,\nobtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be\nunbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We\nthen argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead\nnormalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a\nfault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is\nstill not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight\ncompares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity\npreserver.\n  In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria\nnotions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a\nmin-weight $(f' > f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question\nis to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness\nupper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$.\nIn particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$\nfor a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT\nconnectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT\nconnectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just\n$O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a\n$(1+\\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies\nfor a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback\nlinearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the\nlinear-quadratic-Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC\nand INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the\nSMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and\noptimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems\nwhile remaining unaffected by the SMIB system's internal dynamics and operating\nconditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman\nfilter, designed using the LTR procedure and a detailed frequency-domain\nloop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal\nperformance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability\nmargins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for\nconstructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and\nnonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems by utilizing a\nhigh-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model,\nand the correlations between the two models' control inputs. Rigorous\nsimulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a\nfull-state linear-quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and\ntrade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state\nerror, robustness, rotor angle stability, frequency control, and voltage\nregulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to\nguide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power\nsystems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.",

While prior works have explored\nthis clinically significant task using various strategies of domain alignment,\nthey often lack an explicit and explainable mechanism to ensure that target\nimage features capture meaningful structural information. Besides, these\nmethods are prone to the curse of dimensionality, inevitably leading to\nchallenges in interpretability and computational efficiency. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RemInD, a framework inspired by human adaptation.\nRemInD learns a domain-agnostic latent manifold, characterized by several\nanchors, to memorize anatomical variations. By mapping images onto this\nmanifold as weighted anchor averages, our approach ensures realistic and\nreliable predictions. This design mirrors how humans develop representative\ncomponents to understand images and then retrieve component combinations from\nmemory to guide segmentation. Notably, model prediction is determined by two\nexplainable factors: a low-dimensional anchor weight vector, and a spatial\ndeformation. This design facilitates computationally efficient and\ngeometry-adherent adaptation by aligning weight vectors between domains on a\nprobability simplex. Experiments on two public datasets, encompassing cardiac\nand abdominal imaging, demonstrate the superiority of RemInD, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance using a single alignment approach, outperforming\nexisting methods that often rely on multiple complex alignment strategies.",

Existing Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN)-based methods commonly adopt the \"Node-Edge approach\", in which\nthe model first computes an embedding vector for each variable-node, then uses\nthese variable-wise representations to concurrently and independently predict\nfor each directed causal-edge. In this paper, we first show that this\narchitecture has some systematic bias that cannot be mitigated regardless of\nmodel size and data size. We then propose SiCL, a DNN-based SCL method that\npredicts a skeleton matrix together with a v-tensor (a third-order tensor\nrepresenting the v-structures). According to the Markov Equivalence Class (MEC)\ntheory, both the skeleton and the v-structures are identifiable causal\nstructures under the canonical MEC setting, so predictions about skeleton and\nv-structures do not suffer from the identifiability limit in causal discovery,\nthus SiCL can avoid the systematic bias in Node-Edge architecture, and enable\nconsistent estimators for causal discovery. Moreover, SiCL is also equipped\nwith a specially designed pairwise encoder module with a unidirectional\nattention layer to model both internal and external relationships of pairs of\nnodes. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show\nthat SiCL significantly outperforms other DNN-based SCL approaches.",

Our arguments differ substantially from earlier constructions of\nthe IIC; we do not directly use the machinery of the lace expansion or similar\ndiagrammatic expansions. We show that the IIC may be constructed by\nconditioning on the cluster of a vertex being infinite in the supercritical\nregime $p > p_c$ and then taking $p \\searrow p_c$. Furthermore, at criticality,\nwe show that the IIC may be constructed by conditioning on a connection to an\narbitrary distant set $V$, generalizing previous constructions where one\nconditions on a connection to a single distant vertex or the boundary of a\nlarge box.\n  The input to our proof are the asymptotics for the two-point function\nobtained by Hara, van der Hofstad, and Slade. Our construction thus applies in\nall dimensions for which those asymptotics are known, rather than an\nunspecified high dimension considered in previous works.

While this effectively densifies the matrix\nby assuming users and movies can be represented by linearly dependent latent\nfeatures, it does not capture more complicated interactions. For example,\nvector representations struggle with set-theoretic relationships, such as\nnegation and intersection, e.g. recommending a movie that is \"comedy and\naction, but not romance\". In this work, we formulate the problem of\npersonalized item recommendation as matrix completion where rows are\nset-theoretically dependent. To capture this set-theoretic dependence we\nrepresent each user and attribute by a hyper-rectangle or box (i.e. a Cartesian\nproduct of intervals). Box embeddings can intuitively be understood as\ntrainable Venn diagrams, and thus not only inherently represent similarity (via\nthe Jaccard index), but also naturally and faithfully support arbitrary\nset-theoretic relationships. Queries involving set-theoretic constraints can be\nefficiently computed directly on the embedding space by performing geometric\noperations on the representations.

To address these challenges, this paper incorporates\nmultidimensional graph neural networks (MDGNNs) with edge-graph information\nbottleneck (EGIB) to design a robust framework for signal processing.\nSpecifically, MDGNNs utilize hyper-edges instead of vertices to update\nrepresentations to avoid indistinguishable features and reduce information\nloss, while EGIB encourages providing minimal sufficient information about\noutputs to avoid aggregation of irrelevant information. We numerically\ndemonstrate that compared with existing frameworks, the proposed frameworks\nachieve excellent performance in terms of spectrum efficiency (SE) and network\noverhead under multiple signal processing tasks.

    "abstract": "The application of large language models (LLMs) in the legal domain holds\nsignificant potential for information retrieval and question answering, yet\nThai legal QA systems face challenges due to a lack of standardized evaluation\nbenchmarks and the complexity of Thai legal structures. This paper introduces\nNitiBench, a benchmark comprising two datasets: the NitiBench-CCL, covering\ngeneral Thai financial law, and the NitiBench-Tax, which includes real-world\ntax law cases requiring advanced legal reasoning. We evaluate\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context LLM-based approaches to\naddress three key research questions: the impact of domain-specific components\nlike section-based chunking and cross-referencing, the comparative performance\nof different retrievers and LLMs, and the viability of long-context LLMs as an\nalternative to RAG. Our results show that section-based chunking significantly\nimproves retrieval and end-to-end performance, current retrievers struggle with\ncomplex queries, and long-context LLMs still underperform RAG-based systems in\nThai legal QA. To support fair evaluation, we propose tailored multi-label\nretrieval metrics and the use of an LLM-as-judge for coverage and contradiction\ndetection method. These findings highlight the limitations of current Thai\nlegal NLP solutions and provide a foundation for future research in the field.\nWe also open-sourced our codes and dataset to available publicly.",

    "abstract": "The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the\nimperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space\nAgency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its\nscience return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray\nIntegral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active\ncooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft\nlevel is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned\ncryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit,\nwhile a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift\ndown to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core\nconcept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor\nmicrocalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme.\nNoteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in\nthe multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument\nenergy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV\nresolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more\nthan a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a\n4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an\noverview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated\nperformances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short\nterm focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early\n2027.",

The author showed in $2017$\nthat for any RS function $f_n$ in $n$ variables, the sequence of Hamming\nweights $wt(f_n)$ for all values of $n$ satisfies a linear recurrence with\nassociated recursion polynomial given by the minimal polynomial of a {\\em rules\nmatrix}. Examples showed that the usual formula for the weights $wt(f_n)$ in\nterms of powers of the roots of the minimal polynomial always has simple\ncoefficients. The conjecture that this is always true is the Easy Coefficients\nConjecture (ECC). The present paper proves the ECC if the rules matrix\nsatisfies a certain condition. Major applications include an enormous decrease\nin the amount of computation that is needed to determine the values of\n$wt(f_n)$ for a quadratic RS function $f_n$ if either $n$ or the order of the\nrecursion for the weights is large, and a simpler way to determine the Dickson\nform of $f_n.$ The ECC also enables rapid computation of generating functions\nwhich give the values of $wt(f_n)$ as coefficients in a power series.",

The pristine C$_{36}$N$_{18}$ nanosheets\nexhibit limited HER activity, primarily due to high positive Gibbs free\nenergies ($>$ 2.2 eV). To enhance catalytic performance, doping with B, Si, or\nP at the nitrogen site was explored. Among these systems, B-doped\nC$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets exhibit the most promising catalytic activity, with\na Gibbs free energy close to zero ($\\approx -0.2$ eV), indicating efficient\nhydrogen adsorption. Band structure, projected density of states, charge\ndensity, and Bader charge analyses reveal significant changes in the electronic\nenvironment due to doping. While stacking configurations (AA$'$A$''$ and ABC)\nhave minimal effect on catalytic performance, doping -- particularly with B --\nsubstantially alters the electronic structure, optimizing hydrogen adsorption\nand facilitating efficient HER.

    "abstract": "The co-design of robot morphology and neural control typically requires using\nreinforcement learning to approximate a unique control policy gradient for each\nbody plan, demanding massive amounts of training data to measure the\nperformance of each design. Here we show that a universal, morphology-agnostic\ncontroller can be rapidly and directly obtained by gradient-based optimization\nthrough differentiable simulation. This process of morphological pretraining\nallows the designer to explore non-differentiable changes to a robot's physical\nlayout (e.g. adding, removing and recombining discrete body parts) and\nimmediately determine which revisions are beneficial and which are deleterious\nusing the pretrained model. We term this process \"zero-shot evolution\" and\ncompare it with the simultaneous co-optimization of a universal controller\nalongside an evolving design population. We find the latter results in\ndiversity collapse, a previously unknown pathology whereby the population --\nand thus the controller's training data -- converges to similar designs that\nare easier to steer with a shared universal controller. We show that zero-shot\nevolution with a pretrained controller quickly yields a diversity of highly\nperformant designs, and by fine-tuning the pretrained controller on the current\npopulation throughout evolution, diversity is not only preserved but\nsignificantly increased as superior performance is achieved.",

Indeed, end-to-end latency guarantees require the\nend-to-end management of slice resources. For this purpose, after discussing\nthe main gaps in the state-of-the-art with regards to such an objective, we\npropose a novel slicing architecture that enables the management and\norchestration of slice segments that span over all the domains of an end-to-end\napplication service, including the MEC. We also show how this general\nmanagement architecture can be instantiated into a multi-tenant MEC\ninfrastructure. A preliminary implementation of the proposed architecture\nfocusing on the MEC domain is also provided, together with performance tests to\nvalidate the feasibility and efficacy of our design approach.",

To ensure that hydrogen production\naligns with these goals, the European Commission has introduced criteria for\nadditionality, temporal correlation, and geographical correlation. These\ncriteria are designed to ensure that hydrogen production from renewable sources\nsupports the growth of renewable energy. This study assesses the impact of\nthese criteria on green hydrogen production, focusing on production costs and\ntechnology impacts. The European energy market is simulated up to 2048 using\nstochastic programming, applying these requirements exclusively to green\nhydrogen production without the phased-in compliance period outlined in the EU\nregulations. The findings show that meeting the criteria will increase expected\nsystem costs by 82 EUR billion from 2024 to 2048, largely due to the rapid\nshift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The additionality requirement,\nwhich mandates the use of new renewable energy installations for electrolysis,\nproves to be the most expensive, but also the most effective in accelerating\nrenewable energy adoption.",

However, the convergence of Picard for this system is only linear\nand slows as the Rayleigh number increases, eventually failing for even\nmoderately sized Rayleigh numbers. We consider this solver in the setting where\nsparse solution data is available, e.g. from data measurements or solution\nobservables, and enhance Picard by incorporating the data into the iteration\nusing a continuous data assimilation (CDA) approach. We prove that our approach\nscales the linear convergence rate by $H^{1/2}$, where $H$ is the\ncharacteristic spacing of the measurement locations. This implies that when\nPicard is converging, CDA will accelerate convergence, and when Picard is not\nconverging, CDA (with enough data) will enable convergence. In the case of\nnoisy data, we prove that the linear convergence rate of the nonlinear residual\nis similarly scaled by $H^{1/2}$ but the accuracy is limited by the accuracy of\nthe data.

Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties\nin tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a\ndomain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA\nestimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity\nwithout compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios\nunder a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both\nuniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order\napproximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then\nreinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a\nmultivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance\nstability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the\nMAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on\nmajorization-minimization principles.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that large language model (LLM)-powered\nconversational agents often exhibit `sycophancy', a tendency to adapt their\nresponses to align with user perspectives, even at the expense of factual\naccuracy. However, users' perceptions of LLM sycophancy and its interplay with\nother anthropomorphic features (e.g., friendliness) in shaping user trust\nremains understudied. To bridge this gap, we conducted a 2 (Sycophancy:\npresence vs. absence) x 2 (Friendliness: high vs. low) between-subjects\nexperiment (N = 224). Our study uncovered, for the first time, the intricate\ndynamics between LLM sycophancy and friendliness: When an LLM agent already\nexhibits a friendly demeanor, being sycophantic reduces perceived authenticity,\nthereby lowering user trust; Conversely, when the agent is less friendly,\naligning its responses with user opinions makes it appear more genuine, leading\nto higher user trust. Our findings entail profound implications for AI\npersuasion through exploiting human psychological tendencies and highlight the\nimperative for responsible designs in user-LLM agent interactions.",

LEAPS can be seen as a continuous-time formulation of annealed\nimportance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods, extended so that the\nvariance of the importance weights is offset by the inclusion of the CTMC. To\nderive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym\nderivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these\nweights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate\nmatrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we\ncall \"locally equivariant\" functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a\nfamily of locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and\nconvolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that\npreserve the local equivariance.

Despite its outstanding results on\ndiverse material objects, a typical MVPS experimental setup requires a\nwell-calibrated light source and a monocular camera installed on an immovable\nbase. This restricts the use of MVPS on a movable platform, limiting us from\ntaking MVPS benefits in 3D acquisition for mobile robotics applications. To\nthis end, we introduce a new mobile robotic system for MVPS. While the proposed\nsystem brings advantages, it introduces additional algorithmic challenges.\nAddressing them, in this paper, we further propose an incremental approach for\nmobile robotic MVPS. Our approach leverages a supervised learning setup to\npredict per-view surface normal, object depth, and per-pixel uncertainty in\nmodel-predicted results. A refined depth map per view is obtained by solving an\nMVPS-driven optimization problem proposed in this paper. Later, we fuse the\nrefined depth map while tracking the camera pose w.r.t the reference frame to\nrecover globally consistent object 3D geometry. Experimental results show the\nadvantages of our robotic system and algorithm, featuring the local\nhigh-frequency surface detail recovery with globally consistent object shape.\nOur work is beyond any MVPS system yet presented, providing encouraging results\non objects with unknown reflectance properties using fewer frames without a\ntiring calibration and installation process, enabling computationally efficient\nrobotic automation approach to photogrammetry.

It involves assigning item identifiers for LLMs to encode user history\nand generate the next item. Existing approaches leverage either token-sequence\nidentifiers, representing items as discrete token sequences, or single-token\nidentifiers, using ID or semantic embeddings. Token-sequence identifiers face\nissues such as the local optima problem in beam search and low generation\nefficiency due to step-by-step generation. In contrast, single-token\nidentifiers fail to capture rich semantics or encode Collaborative Filtering\n(CF) information, resulting in suboptimal performance.\n  To address these issues, we propose two fundamental principles for item\nidentifier design: 1) integrating both CF and semantic information to fully\ncapture multi-dimensional item information, and 2) designing order-agnostic\nidentifiers without token dependency, mitigating the local optima issue and\nachieving simultaneous generation for generation efficiency. Accordingly, we\nintroduce a novel set identifier paradigm for LLM-based generative\nrecommendation, representing each item as a set of order-agnostic tokens. To\nimplement this paradigm, we propose SETRec, which leverages CF and semantic\ntokenizers to obtain order-agnostic multi-dimensional tokens. To eliminate\ntoken dependency, SETRec uses a sparse attention mask for user history encoding\nand a query-guided generation mechanism for simultaneous token generation. We\ninstantiate SETRec on T5 and Qwen (from 1.5B to 7B). Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate its effectiveness under various scenarios (e.g., full ranking,\nwarm- and cold-start ranking, and various item popularity groups).

    "abstract": "The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th\ncentury, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the\nmicroscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures\nand phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the\nneed for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of\ncomplex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first\nalgorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to\ncomputational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family\nof differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics --\nand assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall\ndiversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis\nat scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine\nlearning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein\nuniverse, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that\nAlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute\nmost to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database\nled to similar findings: more than $85\\%$ of the crystals with formation energy\ndata are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance\ndiversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as\nmemorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized\ntraining samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the\nbest-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least\nto diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a\npowerful tool for data-driven science.",

Progress in theoretical\nunderstanding, instrumentation, and sample formulation expanded the range of\nmaterials applications and research questions that can benefit from MAS DNP.\nCurrently the most common approach for hyperpolarization under MAS consists in\nimpregnating the sample of interest with a solution containing nitroxide\nradicals, which upon microwave irradiation serve as exogenous polarizing\nagents. On the other hand, in metal ion based (MI)-DNP, inorganic materials are\ndoped with paramagnetic metal centres, which then can be used as endogenous\npolarizing agents. In this work we give an overview of the electron\nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) concepts required to characterize the metal ions\nand discuss the expected changes in the NMR response due to the presence of\nparamagnetic species. We highlight which properties of the electron spins are\nbeneficial for applications as polarizing agents in DNP and how to recognize\nthem, both from the EPR and NMR data. A theoretical description of the main DNP\nmechanisms is given, employing a quantum mechanical formalism, and these\nconcepts are used to explain the spin dynamics observed in the DNP experiment.\nIn addition, we highlight the main differences between MI-DNP and the more\ncommon approaches in MAS DNP, which use organic radicals as exogenous\npolarizing source. Finally, we review some applications of metal ions as\npolarizing agents in general and then focus particularly on research questions\nin materials science that can benefit from MI-DNP.",

A\ncharge-sensitive preamplifier (CSP) is powered by two 3 V lithium batteries\n(A123), providing +/-3 V rail voltages. Both the detector and preamplifier\ncircuits are integrated onto the same 4-layer PCB and housed on the vacuum side\nof the IBS, facing the fusion target. The system employs a CF-2.75 flanged DB-9\nconnector feedthrough to supply the signal, bias voltage, and rail voltages. To\nmitigate the high sensitivity of the detector to optical light, a thin aluminum\nfoil assembly is used to block optical emissions from the ion beam and target.\nCharged particles generate step responses on the preamplifier output, with\npulse rise times on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 us. These signals are recorded\nusing a custom-built data acquisition unit, which features an optical fiber\ndata link to ensure electrical isolation of the detector electronics.\nSubsequent digital signal processing is employed to optimally shape the pulses\nusing a CR-RC^4 filter to produce Gaussian-shaped signals, enabling accurate\nextraction of energy information. Performance results show that the\nsignal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for D-D fusion charged particles - protons,\ntritons, and helions - are approximately 30, 10, and 5, respectively, with a\nshaping time constant of 4 us.",

In order to optimize the use of\nwireless resources, 6G ISAC systems need to harness the communication data\npayload signals, which are inherently random, for both sensing and\ncommunication (S&C) purposes. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive\ntechnical overview of the fundamental theory and signal processing\nmethodologies for ISAC transmission with random communication signals. We begin\nby introducing the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) between S&C from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, emphasizing the need for specialized signal\nprocessing techniques tailored to random ISAC signals. Building on this\nfoundation, we review the core signal models and processing pipelines for\ncommunication-centric ISAC systems, and analyze the average squared\nauto-correlation function (ACF) of random ISAC signals, which serves as a\nfundamental performance metric for multi-target ranging tasks. Drawing insights\nfrom these theoretical results, we outline the design principles for the three\nkey components of communication-centric ISAC systems: modulation schemes,\nconstellation design, and pulse shaping filters. The goal is to either enhance\nsensing performance without compromising communication efficiency or to\nestablish a scalable tradeoff between the two. We then extend our analysis from\na single-antenna ISAC system to its multi-antenna counterpart, discussing\nrecent advancements in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) precoding techniques\nspecifically designed for random ISAC signals.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are models that leverage the graph structure to\ntransmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing\noperation. While widely successful, this approach is well known to suffer from\nthe over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena, which result in\nrepresentational collapse as the number of layers increases and insensitivity\nto the information contained at distant and poorly connected nodes,\nrespectively. In this paper, we present a unified view of these problems\nthrough the lens of vanishing gradients, using ideas from linear control theory\nfor our analysis. We propose an interpretation of GNNs as recurrent models and\nempirically demonstrate that a simple state-space formulation of a GNN\neffectively alleviates over-smoothing and over-squashing at no extra trainable\nparameter cost. Further, we show theoretically and empirically that (i) GNNs\nare by design prone to extreme gradient vanishing even after a few layers; (ii)\nOver-smoothing is directly related to the mechanism causing vanishing\ngradients; (iii) Over-squashing is most easily alleviated by a combination of\ngraph rewiring and vanishing gradient mitigation. We believe our work will help\nbridge the gap between the recurrent and graph neural network literature and\nwill unlock the design of new deep and performant GNNs.",

Subsequently, it\nprogressively encodes information from the largest to the smallest scale,\nthereby mimicking an energy-cascade process. A turbulent channel flow with\n$\\text{Re}_{\\tau} = 180$ is adopted as the training and testing dataset,\nwhereas the rate-of-strain tensor is used as the input variable to adhere the\nrotational invariance. $\\textit{A priori}$ test results show that the MSC-SGS\nmodel predicts the physical quantities of residual stress, SGS dissipation,\nbackscatter, and SGS transport more accurately than two other convolutional\nneural network (CNN)-based monoscale and U-Net, while maintaining high temporal\ncorrelation. Based on $\\textit{a posteriori}$ test, the MSC-SGS model\noutperforms the two other CNN models and the conventional Smagorinsky model in\npredicting turbulence statistics while ensuring numerical stability without\nresorting to ad-hoc treatments such as clipping excessive backscatters.

An initial semantics result was first\nproved by Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi using {\\Sigma}-monoids in their seminal\npaper published at LICS'99. Alternative frameworks were later introduced by\nHirschowitz and Maggesi using modules over monads, and by Matthes and Uustalu\nusing heterogeneous substitution systems.

Doing so we show that modules over monoids\nprovide an abstract and easy to manipulate framework, that {\\Sigma}-monoids and\nstrengths naturally arise when stating and proving an initiality theorem, and\nthat heterogeneous substitution systems enable us to prove the initiality\ntheorem modularly.

We further display how the atomic OAM modulates the\nperiodicity of the output spot pattern in the hybrid system.

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic\ntechnology, already achieving efficiencies surpassing 25%. However, effects\nsuch as hysteresis are commonly observed due to the interplay of ionic and\nelectronic transport occurring over different timescales. Despite the\nwidespread use of impedance spectroscopy (IS), physical interpretation in PSCs\nis specially challenging due to memory effects. In this study, we focus on\nintegrating experimental data with an analytical device transport model. The\nPSCs under investigation were fabricated using a\nCs$_{0.17}$FA$_{0.83}$Pb(I$_{0.83}$Br$_{0.17}$)$_3$ active layer between\nNb$_2$O$_5$/TiO$_2$ (compact/mesoporous) and Spiro-OMeTAD. Our fully analytical\ncharge transport model incorporates independent charge transport channels,\nenabling the correlation of experimental observations in both dark and under\nillumination. We employed IS together with various voltammetry techniques to\nreveal the dynamics of the transport processes, including voltage pulses and\nboth small and large amplitude sinusoidal excitations. Although small\nperturbations are commonly used in IS, our findings demonstrate that large\nsinusoidal excitation provides new valuable insights in the transition from\ncapacitive to inductive-like responses. The proposed model based purely on\ncharge trapping and generation effectively captures device behavior under both\nsmall and large voltages without inductive elements, validated through accurate\nsimulations of hysteresis and other electrical phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative models has led to the proliferation of\nhighly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for\ndetection methods to generalize across diverse and evolving generative\ntechniques. Existing approaches often fail to adapt to unknown models without\ncostly retraining, limiting their practicability. To fill this gap, we propose\nPost-hoc Distribution Alignment (PDA), a novel approach for the generalizable\ndetection for AI-generated images. The key idea is to use the known generative\nmodel to regenerate undifferentiated test images. This process aligns the\ndistributions of the re-generated real images with the known fake images,\nenabling effective distinction from unknown fake images. PDA employs a two-step\ndetection framework: 1) evaluating whether a test image aligns with the known\nfake distribution based on deep k-nearest neighbor (KNN) distance, and 2)\nre-generating test images using known generative models to create pseudo-fake\nimages for further classification. This alignment strategy allows PDA to\neffectively detect fake images without relying on unseen data or requiring\nretraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PDA, achieving\n96.73\\% average accuracy across six state-of-the-art generative models,\nincluding GANs, diffusion models, and text-to-image models, and improving by\n16.07\\% over the best baseline.

Existing approaches either use other learning criteria [BBQ+ 18, TRO23,\nTO21, HDB+ 19], or explicitly set a prior on downstream tasks, such as reward\nfunctions given by a random neural network [FPAL24].\n  Here we prove that the zero-shot RL loss can be optimized directly, for a\nrange of non-informative priors such as white noise rewards, temporally smooth\nrewards, ``scattered'' sparse rewards, or a combination of those.\n  Thus, it is possible to learn the optimal zero-shot features algorithmically,\nfor a wide mixture of priors.\n  Surprisingly, the white noise prior leads to an objective almost identical to\nthe one in VISR [HDB+19], via a different approach. This shows that some\nseemingly arbitrary choices in VISR, such as Von Mises--Fisher distributions,\ndo maximize downstream performance. This also suggests more efficient ways to\ntackle the VISR objective.\n  Finally, we discuss some consequences and limitations of the zero-shot RL\nobjective, such as its tendency to produce narrow optimal features if only\nusing Gaussian dense reward priors.",

Laplacian eigenfunctions (the eigenfunctions of\n$\\Delta+\\Delta^\\ast$ with $\\Delta$ the Laplacian operator of some reference\npolicy and $\\Delta^\\ast$ that of the time-reversed dynamics) have been argued\nto play a role, and offer good empirical performance.\n  Here, for the first time, we identify the optimal base features based on an\nobjective criterion of downstream performance, in a non-tautological way\nwithout assuming the downstream tasks are linear in the features. We do this\nfor three generic classes of downstream tasks: reaching a random goal state,\ndense random Gaussian rewards, and random ``scattered'' sparse rewards. The\nfeatures yielding optimal expected downstream performance turn out to be the\n\\emph{same} for these three task families.

    "abstract": "During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a\nChern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic\ninstability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends\non the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the\naxion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the\nstrength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential\ninfluence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in\nwhich the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong\nbackreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically\noscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak\namplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases\nthe peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of\ngravitational waves.",

Existing frameworks primarily focus on specific dimensions\nsuch as security and privacy, often neglecting critical dimensions such as\nethics, resilience, robustness, and reliability.

We demonstrate the application of DISTAF through a\nreal-world implementation using a Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP)\ninstance, refining its metrics to simplify trustworthiness assessment. Our\napproach introduces clustering mechanisms for metrics, hierarchical scoring,\nand mandatory criteria to ensure robust and consistent evaluations across an\nEIDS in both the design and operation stages. Furthermore, DISTAF is adaptable\nto emerging technologies like Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), integrating\nprivacy-enhancing techniques and ethical considerations to meet modern\nchallenges.

Using the Helfrich Hamiltonian, triangulated membrane models, and\nenergy minimization techniques, we predict multiple stable wrapping states and\nidentify the conditions for their coexistence. Our results demonstrate that\nsofter vesicles bind more easily to planar membranes; however, achieving\ncomplete wrapping requires significantly higher adhesion strengths compared to\nrigid particles. As membrane tension increases, deep-wrapped states disappear\nat a triple point where shallow-wrapped, deep-wrapped, and complete-wrapped\nstates coexist. The coordinates of the triple point are highly sensitive to the\nvesicle shape and stiffness. For stomatocytes, increasing stiffness shifts the\ntriple point to higher adhesion strengths and membrane tensions, while for\noblates it shifts to lower values, influenced by shape changes during wrapping.\nOblate shapes are preferred in shallow-wrapped states and stomatocytes in\ndeep-wrapped states. In contrast to hard particles, where optimal adhesion\nstrength for complete wrapping occurs at tensionless membranes, complete\nwrapping of soft vesicles requires finite membrane tension for optimal adhesion\nstrength.

    "abstract": "User information needs are often highly diverse and varied. A key challenge\nin current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation\nwhile enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test\ntime. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language\nmodels individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and\nwidely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance\ndue to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning.\nTo address this issue, we propose Bone Soup, a novel model merging approach\nthat first seeks a series of backbone models by considering the impacts of\nmultiple objectives and then makes the soup (i.e., merge the backbone models).\nSpecifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for\ndifferent objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each\nbackbone model is guided by a combination of backbone reward signals. To ensure\nthat these models are optimal for the Pareto front, the backbone rewards are\ncrafted by combining standard reward functions into basis vectors, which can\nthen be modified through a rule-based construction method. Bone Soup leverages\na symmetric circulant matrix mapping to generate the merging coefficients,\nwhich are used to merge the backbone models according to user preferences.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that Bone Soup exhibits strong\ncontrollability and Pareto optimality in controllable multi-objective\ngeneration, providing a more effective and efficient approach to addressing\ndiverse user needs at test time.",

This estimator is embedded within the\nwhole-body control framework to compensate for disturbances in the legged\nsystem. Second, a comprehensive whole-body disturbance rejection control\nframework (WB-DRC) is introduced, accounting for the robot's full-body\ndynamics. Compared to previous whole-body control frameworks, WB-DRC\neffectively handles external disturbances and model uncertainties, with the\npotential to adapt to complex terrain. Third, simulations of both biped and\nquadruped robots are conducted in the Gazebo simulator to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and versatility of WB-DRC.

However, a clear under-standing of the dissolution mechanism of\nmagnesium in the most common aqueous environments re-mains a critical\nchallenge, hindering the broader application of magnesium alloys. To address\npending key controversies in magnesium alloys research, the atomic-scale\nhydrogen evolution process and dis-solution mechanism of magnesium were\ninvestigated by combining machine learning molecular dy-namics with density\nfunctional theory. These controversies include the presence of magnesium\nreaction intermediates, the formation of uni-positive Mg+, the specific\nreaction steps involved in hydrogen evo-lution and magnesium dissolution, and\nthe generation and growth mechanisms of the surface films. The results indicate\nthat the intermediate species in the magnesium dissolution process is\nsolid-phase MgOH, which exhibits an MgO-like structure. The magnesium in MgOH\nis identified as the widely recognized uni-positive Mg+. The intermediate film\nis formed, consisting primarily of the MgOH phase with a small amount of MgO.\nThis film grows inward by extending into the magnesium substrate. Un-der\nsufficient water availability, the film undergoes further oxidation to form\nMg(OH)2. These findings highlight the critical role of the MgOH phase in the\nmagnesium dissolution process, leading to the pro-posal of a dissolution model\nbased on MgOH/MgO solid phases as intermediates. These insights deep-en the\nunderstanding of magnesium dissolution, pave the way for the development of\nmore effective anti-corrosion strategies for magnesium alloys, and may also\nadvance the utilization of magnesium in energy storage applications.",

Different from the common methods that fine-tune the model or\nadjust the classifier parameters online, we propose to generate multiple layer\nparameters on the fly during inference by a lightweight meta-learned\ntransformer, which we call \\textit{GeneralizeFormer}. The layer-wise parameters\nare generated per target batch without fine-tuning or online adjustment. By\ndoing so, our method is more effective in dynamic scenarios with multiple\ntarget distributions and also avoids forgetting valuable source distribution\ncharacteristics. Moreover, by considering layer-wise gradients, the proposed\nmethod adapts itself to various distribution shifts. To reduce the\ncomputational and time cost, we fix the convolutional parameters while only\ngenerating parameters of the Batch Normalization layers and the linear\nclassifier. Experiments on six widely used domain generalization datasets\ndemonstrate the benefits and abilities of the proposed method to efficiently\nhandle various distribution shifts, generalize in dynamic scenarios, and avoid\nforgetting.",

Our proposed model aims to\novercome these challenges. In this approach, a conventional volume of solid\nobject is discretized into a number of discrete spherical elements. A bond\nnetwork is added to connect neighbouring particles at micro-scale, forming a\ncohesive structure at macro-scale. It is indeed a combination of particulate\nflow simulation by coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Discrete\nElement Method (DEM) and materials modelling by DEM using a bond model. An\nextensive study of fluid response in both laminar and turbulent flow is\nconducted when the traditional continuous rigid object is replaced by a\ncorresponding discrete deformable object composed of bonded spherical\nparticles. The replacement of discrete object allows this model to naturally\nincorporate the three-way interaction of fluid, structure, and particles. The\ninteraction between fluid and structure at macro-scale is implicitly\nrepresented by the interaction between fluid and bonded particles at\nmicro-scale, while material properties and the micro-structure of the solid\nobject are reproduced by properties of bond that account for deformation and\nfracture.

The X-ray Diffraction (XRD)\nof the as-cleaved ingots indicate that the orientation is mainly along the h0l\ndirection. From the Raman spectra, a comparison of the linewidth variation with\ntemperature for the in-plane (E-mode) vibrations reveals a subtle enhancement\naround 170 K for the less stoichiometric crystal, depicting a more anharmonic\nnature, via the 4-phonon scattering processes. Furthermore, a comparison of the\nout-of-plane A_T^1 mode indicates a sensitivity of a weaker Raman signal (\nabout 239 cm -1) from disordered GeTe4 tetrahedra that has adversely affected\nthe mode dynamics in the less stoichiometric sample (S1). However, this weaker\nsignal is not observed for the more stoichiometric sample (S2) below 200 K. The\nMachine Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations performed to calculate\nthe phonon spectral densities reveal that the heavier atom, Te dominate below\n100 cm-1, while, the lighter Ge has more significant contribution above 100\ncm-1. Thus, the change observed only in the 120 cm-1 (A_T^1) mode is justified\nby defects at the Ge sites. Specific heat capacity measurements are performed\nthat show a broad hump near 14 K, when plotted as Cp/T^3 versus T indicative of\na non-Debye nature. Hence, considering the two optical modes in the Raman\nspectra, a Debye and two-Einstein modes model is conceptualized to explain the\nlow-temperature specific heat. These calculations reveal a softer bonding\nvis-a-vis lowering of Debye temperature in S1. Lower Einstein temperatures are\nalso observed in S1, which is attributed to the easy activation of these\nlocalized modes that affect the harmonicity of the lattice. Finally, the\nlow-temperature resistivity measurements reveal a reduction in the effective\nphonon frequency (w_e) through the estimation of Te.",

We first investigated the design\nspace of impact captions by content analysis and a co-design session with four\nexperts.

    "abstract": "The unconditioned reflex (e.g., protective reflex), which is the innate\nreaction of the organism and usually performed through the spinal cord rather\nthan the brain, can enable organisms to escape harms from environments. In this\npaper, we propose an online, highly-dynamic motion planning algorithm to endow\nmanipulators the highly-dynamic unconditioned reflexes to humans and/or\nenvironments. Our method is based on a chained version of Signed Distance\nFunctions (SDFs), which can be pre-computed and stored. Our proposed algorithm\nis divided into two stages. In the offline stage, we create 3 groups of local\nSDFs to store the geometric information of the manipulator and its working\nenvironment. In the online stage, the pre-computed local SDFs are chained\ntogether according the configuration of the manipulator, to provide global\ngeometric information about the environment. While the point clouds of the\ndynamic objects serve as query points to look up these local SDFs for quickly\ngenerating escape velocity. Then we propose a modified geometric Jacobian\nmatrix and use the Jacobian-pseudo-inverse method to generate real-time reflex\nbehaviors to avoid the static and dynamic obstacles in the environment. The\nbenefits of our method are validated in both static and dynamic scenarios. In\nthe static scenario, our method identifies the path solutions with lower time\nconsumption and shorter trajectory length compared to existing solutions. In\nthe dynamic scenario, our method can reliably pursue the dynamic target point,\navoid dynamic obstacles, and react to these obstacles within 1ms, which\nsurpasses the unconditioned reflex reaction time of humans.",

Although they have achieved remarkable\nperformance on NLP missions, such as semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks,\ntheir black-box nature and large-data-driven training style have raised\nconcerns, including issues related to bias, trust, and safety. Many efforts\nhave been made to improve the interpretability of embedding models, but these\nproblems have not been fundamentally resolved. To achieve inherent\ninterpretability, we propose a purely white-box and human-like sentence\nrepresentation network, PropNet. Inspired by findings from cognitive science,\nPropNet constructs a hierarchical network based on the propositions contained\nin a sentence. While experiments indicate that PropNet has a significant gap\ncompared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models in STS tasks, case studies\nreveal substantial room for improvement.

    "abstract": "Spectre v1 information disclosure attacks, which exploit CPU conditional\nbranch misprediction, remain unsolved in deployed software. Certain Spectre v1\ngadgets can be exploited only by out-of-place mistraining, in which the\nattacker controls a victim branch's prediction, possibly from another address\nspace, by training a branch that aliases with the victim in the branch\npredictor unit (BPU) structure. However, constructing a BPU-alias for a victim\nbranch is hard. Consequently, practical out-of-place mistraining attacks use\nbrute-force searches to randomly achieve aliasing. To date, such attacks have\nbeen demonstrated only on Intel x86 CPUs.\n  This paper explores the vulnerability of Apple M-Series CPUs to practical\nout-of-place Spectre v1 mistraining. We show that brute-force out-of-place\nmistraining fails on the M1. We analytically explain the failure is due to the\nsearch space size, assuming (based on Apple patents) that the M1 CPU uses a\nvariant of the TAGE conditional branch predictor. Based on our analysis, we\ndesign a new BPU-alias search technique with reduced search space.

    "abstract": "The Cosmological Principle states that the universe is statistically\nisotropic and homogeneous on large length scales, typically $\\gtrsim 70$Mpc. A\ndetection of significant deviation would help us falsify the simplest models of\ninflation. In this regard, there are potential indications of departures from\nthis principle, e.g., observations from WMAP and Planck show signs of a\npreferred direction in the temperature fluctuations known as hemispherical\nasymmetry in CMB. Phenomenologically, this has been studied using a dipole\nmodulation model. In addition to this, a number of possible mechanisms have\nbeen proposed in the literature to explain this anomaly. Some of these\nscenarios generate dipolar asymmetry or predict quadrupolar asymmetry in the\nprimordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we study\nboth these asymmetries. To fulfill the objective, we employ 21cm intensity\nmapping technique post during post-reionization era, i.e., $z\\lesssim 7$. We\napply Fisher formalism to constrain dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropy\nparameters using both 21cm power and bispectra and give forecasts for three\nintensity mapping surveys: SKA-Mid, HIRAX and PUMA. Although 21cm intensity\nmapping is a very promising cosmological probe, the signals are severely\naffected by foregrounds. To mitigate the foreground effects, we use foreground\navoidance approach. For the interferometer mode of operation, we also include\nthe wedge effect. From our analysis, we find that PUMA, on account of its high\nredshift range is able to constrain both dipolar and quadrupolar parameters to\nbetter than $\\sim 10^{-3}$ for redshifts $z \\gtrsim 1$. This is one order of\nmagnitude better constraints as compared to those provided by the latest CMB\nsurveys.

We argue that this issue arises because most DG\nstudies focus on establishing theoretical guarantees for generalization under\nunrealistic assumptions, such as the availability of sufficient, diverse (or\neven infinite) domains or access to target domain knowledge. As a result, the\nextent to which domain generalization is achievable in scenarios with limited\ndomains remains largely unexplored. This paper seeks to address this gap by\nexamining generalization through the lens of the conditions necessary for its\nexistence and learnability. Specifically, we systematically establish a set of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for generalization. Our analysis highlights\nthat existing DG methods primarily act as regularization mechanisms focused on\nsatisfying sufficient conditions, while often neglecting necessary ones.\nHowever, sufficient conditions cannot be verified in settings with limited\ntraining domains. In such cases, regularization targeting sufficient conditions\naims to maximize the likelihood of generalization, whereas regularization\ntargeting necessary conditions ensures its existence. Using this analysis, we\nreveal the shortcomings of existing DG algorithms by showing that, while they\npromote sufficient conditions, they inadvertently violate necessary conditions.\nTo validate our theoretical insights, we propose a practical method that\npromotes the sufficient condition while maintaining the necessary conditions\nthrough a novel subspace representation alignment strategy.

Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance\nacross different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP\n(PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Existing supervised action segmentation methods depend on the quality of\nframe-wise classification using attention mechanisms or temporal convolutions\nto capture temporal dependencies. Even boundary detection-based methods\nprimarily depend on the accuracy of an initial frame-wise classification, which\ncan overlook precise identification of segments and boundaries in case of\nlow-quality prediction. To address this problem, this paper proposes ASESM\n(Action Segmentation via Explicit Similarity Measurement) to enhance the\nsegmentation accuracy by incorporating explicit similarity evaluation across\nframes and predictions. Our supervised learning architecture uses frame-level\nmulti-resolution features as input to multiple Transformer encoders. The\nresulting multiple frame-wise predictions are used for similarity voting to\nobtain high quality initial prediction. We apply a newly proposed boundary\ncorrection algorithm that operates based on feature similarity between\nconsecutive frames to adjust the boundary locations iteratively through the\nlearning process. The corrected prediction is then further refined through\nmultiple stages of temporal convolutions. As post-processing, we optionally\napply boundary correction again followed by a segment smoothing method that\nremoves outlier classes within segments using similarity measurement between\nconsecutive predictions. Additionally, we propose a fully unsupervised boundary\ndetection-correction algorithm that identifies segment boundaries based solely\non feature similarity without any training. Experiments on 50Salads, GTEA, and\nBreakfast datasets show the effectiveness of both the supervised and\nunsupervised algorithms. Code and models are made available on Github.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a critical challenge\nin graph learning, as real-world graph data often exhibit diverse and shifting\nenvironments that traditional models fail to generalize across. A promising\nsolution to address this issue is graph invariant learning (GIL), which aims to\nlearn invariant representations by disentangling label-correlated invariant\nsubgraphs from environment-specific subgraphs. However, existing GIL methods\nface two major challenges: (1) the difficulty of capturing and modeling diverse\nenvironments in graph data, and (2) the semantic cliff, where invariant\nsubgraphs from different classes are difficult to distinguish, leading to poor\nclass separability and increased misclassifications. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel method termed Multi-Prototype Hyperspherical\nInvariant Learning (MPHIL), which introduces two key innovations: (1)\nhyperspherical invariant representation extraction, enabling robust and highly\ndiscriminative hyperspherical invariant feature extraction, and (2)\nmulti-prototype hyperspherical classification, which employs class prototypes\nas intermediate variables to eliminate the need for explicit environment\nmodeling in GIL and mitigate the semantic cliff issue. Derived from the\ntheoretical framework of GIL, we introduce two novel objective functions: the\ninvariant prototype matching loss to ensure samples are matched to the correct\nclass prototypes, and the prototype separation loss to increase the distinction\nbetween prototypes of different classes in the hyperspherical space. Extensive\nexperiments on 11 OOD generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPHIL\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing\nmethods across graph data from various domains and with different distribution\nshifts.",

However, training a robust\ncollaborative perception model requires collecting sufficient training data\nthat covers all possible collaboration scenarios, which is impractical due to\nintolerable deployment costs. Hence, the trained model is not robust against\nnew traffic scenarios with inconsistent data distribution and fundamentally\nrestricts its real-world applicability. Further, existing methods, such as\ndomain adaptation, have mitigated this issue by exposing the deployment data\nduring the training stage but incur a high training cost, which is infeasible\nfor resource-constrained agents. In this paper, we propose a\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning-based lightweight framework, CoPEFT, for fast\nadapting a trained collaborative perception model to new deployment\nenvironments under low-cost conditions. CoPEFT develops a Collaboration Adapter\nand Agent Prompt to perform macro-level and micro-level adaptations separately.\nSpecifically, the Collaboration Adapter utilizes the inherent knowledge from\ntraining data and limited deployment data to adapt the feature map to new data\ndistribution. The Agent Prompt further enhances the Collaboration Adapter by\ninserting fine-grained contextual information about the environment.

Specifically, we prove that hallucinations can be made\nstatistically negligible, provided that the quality and quantity of the\ntraining data are sufficient. Interestingly, our positive result coexists with\nthe computability-theoretic result, implying that while hallucinations on an\ninfinite set of inputs cannot be entirely eliminated, their probability can\nalways be reduced by improving algorithms and training data.

The key innovation of our method lies in the utilization\nof the adaptive correntropy function as a localized similarity measure,\nenabling us to treat individual points distinctly.

This\neffectively avoids collapsed, tearing, and other physically implausible\nresults. Moreover, we present a theoretical analysis and establish the\nrelationship between the maximum correntropy criterion and the commonly used\nChamfer distance, highlighting that the correntropy-induced metric can be\nserved as a more universal measure for point cloud analysis. Additionally, we\nintroduce locally linear reconstruction to ensure that regions lacking\ncorrespondences between shapes still undergo physically natural deformations.\nOur method achieves superior or competitive performance compared to existing\napproaches, particularly when dealing with occluded geometries.

    "abstract": "We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each\npossessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization\nover a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize\nspin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic\ndiamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent\nscattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local\nmagnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin\nfiltration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within\nindividual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization\nphenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network\nsize, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due\nto the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate\nenergy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters,\na small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states\nand the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type\nsemiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing\nfuture spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.",

    "abstract": "Contextual memory integration remains a high challenge in the development of\nlanguage models, particularly in tasks that require maintaining coherence over\nextended sequences. Traditional approaches, such as self-attention mechanisms\nand memory-augmented architectures, often prioritize short-term dependencies,\nleading to fragmentation and inconsistency in long-range contextual\nunderstanding. Inspired by principles of synaptic plasticity observed in\nbiological neural systems, a novel mechanism, Synaptic Resonance, is introduced\nto dynamically reinforce relevant memory pathways during training and\ninference. Unlike static memory representations, this mechanism continuously\nadjusts synaptic weight matrices based on contextual relevance, allowing for\nimproved information retention without excessive computational overhead.\nEvaluations conducted on an open-source language model demonstrate reductions\nin perplexity, enhancements in contextual coherence, and increased robustness\nagainst input noise, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven\nmemory modulation. Comparative analysis against baseline models further reveals\nthat the proposed approach achieves higher memory retention efficiency while\nmaintaining computational feasibility. The architectural modifications\nintegrate seamlessly into existing transformer-based frameworks, ensuring\nstable convergence and efficient inference without sacrificing scalability.\nApplications benefiting from improved long-term contextual consistency, such as\ndialogue systems and document summarization, stand to gain from this approach.\nEmpirical findings suggest that dynamically reinforced memory pathways offer a\npromising alternative to conventional memory mechanisms, addressing\nlongstanding limitations in extended sequence modeling.",

    "abstract": "Unit testing attempts to validate the correctness of basic units of the\nsoftware system under test and has a crucial role in software development and\ntesting. Very recent work proposes a retrieve-and-edit approach to generate\nunit test oracles, i.e., assertions. Despite being promising, it is still far\nfrom perfect due to some limitations, such as splitting assertion retrieval and\ngeneration into two separate components without benefiting each other. In this\npaper, we propose AG-RAG, a retrieval-augmented automated assertion generation\napproach that leverages external codebases and joint training to address\nvarious technical limitations of prior work. Inspired by the plastic surgery\nhypothesis, AG-RAG attempts to combine relevant unit tests and advanced\npre-trained language models (PLMs) with retrieval-augmented fine-tuning. AG-RAG\nbuilds a dense retriever to search for relevant test-assert pairs (TAPs) with\nsemantic matching and a retrieval-augmented generator to synthesize accurate\nassertions with the focal-test and retrieved TAPs as input. Besides, AG-RAG\nleverages a code-aware language model CodeT5 as the cornerstone to facilitate\nboth assertion retrieval and generation tasks. Furthermore, the retriever is\noptimized in conjunction with the generator as a whole pipeline with a joint\ntraining strategy. This unified design fully adapts both components\nspecifically for retrieving more useful TAPs, thereby generating accurate\nassertions. We extensively evaluate AG-RAG against six state-of-the-art AG\napproaches on two benchmarks and three metrics. Experimental results show that\nAG-RAG significantly outperforms previous AG approaches on all benchmarks and\nmetrics, e.g., improving the most recent baseline EditAS by 20.82% and 26.98%\nin terms of accuracy. AG-RAG also correctly generates 1739 and 2866 unique\nassertions that all baselines fail to generate, 3.45X and 9.20X more than\nEditAS.",

We address this\nquestion in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved variant of\nisometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows\non the columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward,\nhence the name alternating isometric tensor network states. Second, we\nintroduce a numerical tool -- isometric Gaussian fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) --\nthat incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaussian\nfermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that\nalternating isoTNS represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum\nsystems significantly better than the original isoTNS. First, we show that the\nentanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the isometric arrows and that\nalternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional\nisoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more\nrepresentative, sequential circuit construction of depth $\\mathcal{O}(L_x \\cdot\nL_y)$ compared to the original isoTNS of depth $\\mathcal{O}(L_x + L_y)$. Third,\nusing the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide\nnumerical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of\nalternating isoGfTNS for ground states of various free fermionic models,\nincluding the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and the $p_x + ip_y$\nmean-field superconductor.\n  Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS as compared to\nthe original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse\nfield Ising model.",

    "abstract": "Object detection has advanced significantly with Detection Transformers\n(DETRs). However, these models are computationally demanding, posing challenges\nfor deployment in resource-constrained environments (e.g., self-driving cars).\nKnowledge distillation (KD) is an effective compression method widely applied\nto CNN detectors, but its application to DETR models has been limited. Most KD\nmethods for DETRs fail to distill transformer-specific global context. Also,\nthey blindly believe in the teacher model, which can sometimes be misleading.\nTo bridge the gaps, this paper proposes Consistent Location-and-Context-aware\nKnowledge Distillation (CLoCKDistill) for DETR detectors, which includes both\nfeature distillation and logit distillation components. For feature\ndistillation, instead of distilling backbone features like existing KD methods,\nwe distill the transformer encoder output (i.e., memory) that contains valuable\nglobal context and long-range dependencies. Also, we enrich this memory with\nobject location details during feature distillation so that the student model\ncan prioritize relevant regions while effectively capturing the global context.\nTo facilitate logit distillation, we create target-aware queries based on the\nground truth, allowing both the student and teacher decoders to attend to\nconsistent and accurate parts of encoder memory. Experiments on the KITTI and\nCOCO datasets show our CLoCKDistill method's efficacy across various DETRs,\ne.g., single-scale DAB-DETR, multi-scale deformable DETR, and denoising-based\nDINO. Our method boosts student detector performance by 2.2% to 6.4%.",

Weak inhomogeneities in the natural\nfrequencies are also found to broaden the basin size of synchronous states with\nlower wave-numbers, i.e., more synchronous states.

Existing methods often predict this count without considering\nclass-specific outputs, leading to inaccuracies when such outputs are required.\nThese inaccuracies stem from two key challenges: 1) the prevalence of\nsingle-category images in datasets, which leads models to generalize specific\ncategories as representative of all objects, and 2) the use of mean squared\nerror loss during training, which applies uniform penalization. This uniform\npenalty disregards errors in less frequent categories, particularly when these\nerrors contribute minimally to the overall loss. To address these issues, we\npropose {FocalCount}, a novel approach that leverages diverse feature\nattributes to estimate the number of object categories in an image.

We demonstrate that, in the absence of\ninteraction between dark energy and matter, standard quintessence does not\ngenerate any dynamical friction at the galactic scale.

In this paper, we propose to generate\nhierarchically structured scene descriptions with LLM and then compute the\nscene layouts. Specifically, we train a hierarchy-aware network to infer the\nfine-grained relative positions between objects and design a divide-and-conquer\noptimization to solve for scene layouts. The advantages of using hierarchically\nstructured scene representation are two-fold. First, the hierarchical structure\nprovides a rough grounding for object arrangement, which alleviates\ncontradictory placements with dense relations and enhances the generalization\nability of the network to infer fine-grained placements. Second, it naturally\nsupports the divide-and-conquer optimization, by first arranging the sub-scenes\nand then the entire scene, to more effectively solve for a feasible layout. We\nconduct extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies with both\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations to validate the effectiveness of our\nkey designs with the hierarchically structured scene representation. Our\napproach can generate more reasonable scene layouts while better aligned with\nthe user requirements and LLM descriptions. We also present open-vocabulary\nscene synthesis and interactive scene design results to show the strength of\nour approach in the applications.",

Evaluating these models on six downstream tasks in\nthe few-shot setting reveals that SSL pre-training on RS data offers modest\nperformance improvements over INP, and that it remains competitive in multiple\nscenarios.

The analysis reveals molecular gas formation occurring at column\ndensities up to $\\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, evidenced by an anti-correlation\nbetween $\\textsc{Hi}$ and CO distributions, indicating active\natomic-to-molecular gas conversion. We found a threshold column density for\nmolecular formation at $\\sim5\\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is common among\nmore evolved molecular clouds. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $X_{\\rm CO}$,\nwas found to be $0.7 \\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$,\nlower than the solar neighborhood average. Our chemical models estimate the\ncloud's age to be $\\sim10^{5}-10^{6}$ years, suggesting an early stage of\nmolecular cloud evolution. This interpretation is consistent with the observed\nlow $X_{\\rm CO}$ factor. While virial analysis suggests that the entire cloud\nis gravitationally unbound, we identified several filamentary structures\nextending from the main cloud body. These filaments show systematic velocity\ngradients of $0.5-1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$, and analysis of the velocities\nshows that the molecular gas within them is falling toward the main cloud body,\nfollowing a free-fall model. This suggests ongoing mass accumulation processes\nthrough the filaments, demonstrating that gravitational processes can be\nimportant even at column densities of $\\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.",

We successfully deploy a LLaMA2-7B model,\nachieving a decoding speed of around 5 token/s, utilizing 93.3% of the memory\ncapacity and reaching 85% decoding speed of the theoretical memory bandwidth\nlimit. To fully reserve the memory capacity for model weights and key-value\ncache, we develop the system in a bare-metal environment without an operating\nsystem.

Motivated by\ncancer recurrences, we aim to estimate the optimal individualized treatment\nregime (ITR) that effectively mitigates such recurrent events. An ITR is a\ndecision rule that assigns the optimal treatment to each patient, based on\npersonalized information, with the aim of maximizing the overall therapeutic\nbenefits. However, existing studies of estimating ITR mainly focus on\nfirst-time events rather than recurrent events. To address the issue of\ndetermining the optimal ITR for recurrent events, we propose the Recurrent\nC-learning (ReCL) method to identify the optimal ITR from two or multiple\ntreatment options. The proposed method reformulates the optimization problem\ninto a weighted classification problem. We introduce three estimators for the\nmisclassification cost: the outcome regression estimator, the inverse\nprobability weighting estimator, and the augmented inverse probability\nweighting estimator. The ReCL method leverages classification techniques to\ngenerate an interpretable optimal ITR tailored for recurrent event data. The\nadvantages of the ReCL method are demonstrated through simulations under\nvarious scenarios. Furthermore, based on real data on colorectal cancer\ntreatments, we employ this novel method to derive interpretable tree treatment\nregimes for colorectal cancer, thus providing a practical framework for\nenhancing treatment strategies.",

Unlike\ntraditional methods that rely solely on numerical data, LLM-Lasso incorporates\ndomain-specific knowledge extracted from natural language, enhanced through a\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, to seamlessly integrate\ndata-driven modeling with contextual insights. Specifically, the LLM generates\npenalty factors for each feature, which are converted into weights for the\nLasso penalty using a simple, tunable model. Features identified as more\nrelevant by the LLM receive lower penalties, increasing their likelihood of\nbeing retained in the final model, while less relevant features are assigned\nhigher penalties, reducing their influence. Importantly, LLM-Lasso has an\ninternal validation step that determines how much to trust the contextual\nknowledge in our prediction pipeline. Hence it addresses key challenges in\nrobustness, making it suitable for mitigating potential inaccuracies or\nhallucinations from the LLM. In various biomedical case studies, LLM-Lasso\noutperforms standard Lasso and existing feature selection baselines, all while\nensuring the LLM operates without prior access to the datasets.

It enables\nthe precise management of specific locations and ranges within a sequence,\nallowing for expansion, reduction, or mutation over chosen or random lengths,\nwhile maintaining the integrity of any specified positions or subsequences. In\nthis work, we designed ControllableGPT for drug optimization from the ground\nup, which included proposing the Causally Masked Seq2seq (CMS) objective,\ndeveloping the training corpus, introducing a novel pre-training approach, and\ndevising a unique generation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\ncontrollability of ControllableGPT by conducting experiments on drug\noptimization tasks for both viral and cancer benchmarks, surpassing competing\nbaselines.",

However, the application of LLMs in generating\nreliable medical diagnostic reports remains in the early stages. Currently,\nmedical LLMs typically feature a passive interaction model where doctors\nrespond to patient queries with little or no involvement in analyzing medical\nimages.

The\nproposed ProMRVL-CAD system allows proactive dialogue to provide patients with\nconstant and reliable medical access via an integration of knowledge graph into\na recommendation system.

Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled\npopulations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor\ndispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered\n(spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under\nthe 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may\nsatisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we\nshould expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to\nfurther locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators\non dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a\nfraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new\ninteraction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity\nchange affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our\nresults indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction\n(increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in\necological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range\ndispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of\nIsing spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase\ntransition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that\necosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length\nscale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.",

    "abstract": "Temporal modeling and spatio-temporal collaboration are pivotal techniques\nfor video-based human pose estimation. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt\noptical flow or temporal difference, learning local visual content\ncorrespondence across frames at the pixel level, to capture motion dynamics.\nHowever, such a paradigm essentially relies on localized pixel-to-pixel\nsimilarity, which neglects the semantical correlations among frames and is\nvulnerable to image quality degradations (e.g. occlusions or blur). Moreover,\nexisting approaches often combine motion and spatial (appearance) features via\nsimple concatenation or summation, leading to practical challenges in fully\nleveraging these distinct modalities. In this paper, we present a novel\nframework that learns multi-level semantical dynamics and dense spatio-temporal\ncollaboration for multi-frame human pose estimation. Specifically, we first\ndesign a Multi-Level Semantic Motion Encoder using a multi-masked context and\npose reconstruction strategy. This strategy stimulates the model to explore\nmulti-granularity spatiotemporal semantic relationships among frames by\nprogressively masking the features of (patch) cubes and frames. We further\nintroduce a Spatial-Motion Mutual Learning module which densely propagates and\nconsolidates context information from spatial and motion features to enhance\nthe capability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach sets new state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets,\nPoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.",

    "abstract": "Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) seeks to find relevant labels from\nan extremely large label collection for a given text input. To tackle such a\nvast label space, current state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories.\nThe one-versus-all (OVA) method uses learnable label embeddings for each label,\nexcelling at memorization (i.e., capturing detailed training signals for\naccurate head label prediction). In contrast, the dual-encoder (DE) model maps\ninput and label text into a shared embedding space for better generalization\n(i.e., the capability of predicting tail labels with limited training data),\nbut may fall short at memorization. To achieve generalization and memorization,\nexisting XMC methods often combine DE and OVA models, which involves complex\ntraining pipelines. Inspired by the success of retrieval-augmented language\nmodels, we propose the Retrieval-augmented Encoders for XMC (RAEXMC), a novel\nframework that equips a DE model with retrieval-augmented capability for\nefficient memorization without additional trainable parameter. During training,\nRAEXMC is optimized by the contrastive loss over a knowledge memory that\nconsists of both input instances and labels. During inference, given a test\ninput, RAEXMC retrieves the top-$K$ keys from the knowledge memory, and\naggregates the corresponding values as the prediction scores. We showcase the\neffectiveness and efficiency of RAEXMC on four public LF-XMC benchmarks. RAEXMC\nnot only advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) DE method DEXML, but also\nachieves more than 10x speedup on the largest LF-AmazonTitles-1.3M dataset\nunder the same 8 A100 GPUs training environments.",

Different from most works, we assume the\ncost of evaluating $f$ is potentially nonuniform, and governed by a cost\nfunction $c : D \\rightarrow (0,\\infty)$ which may blow up at certain points. We\ntherefore strive to choose the sampling measure in a way that minimizes the\nexpected total cost. We provide a recovery guarantee which asserts accurate and\nstable recovery with an expected cost depending on the Christoffel function and\nRemez constant of the space $\\mathcal{P}$. This leads to a general recipe for\nfinding a good sampling measure for general $c$. As an example, we consider\none-dimensional polynomial spaces. Here, we provide two strategies for choosing\nthe sampling measure, which we prove are optimal (up to constants and log\nfactors) in the case of algebraically-growing cost functions.",
