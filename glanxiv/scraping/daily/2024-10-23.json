Here we examine $\\textit{equidistributions}$ of finite point\nsets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ by prescribed $\\textit{low dimensional}$ subsets. Our\nmain result states that if $r\\geq 3$ is a prime power, then for any\n$m$-coloring of a sufficiently small point set $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there\nexists an $r$-fan in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ -- that is, the union of $r$ ``half-flats''\nof codimension $r-2$ centered about a common $(r-1)$-codimensional affine\nsubspace -- which captures all the points of $X$ in such a way that each\nhalf-flat contains at most an $r$-th of the points from each color class. The\nnumber of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ we require for this is essentially tight\nwhen $m\\geq 2$. Additionally, we extend our equidistribution results to\n''piercing'' distributions in a similar fashion to Dolnikov's hyperplane\ntransversal generalization of the ham sandwich theorem.

It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse\nsubpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the\nbiological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell\ninteractions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and\nhistological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of\npairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial\ntranscriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they\nare grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for\ncapturing implicit connections among the cells.\n  While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary\nnumber of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks\n(HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than\ntraditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having\nthe actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model\nhas demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of\n1.843 compared to other methods.

    "abstract": "Quantum theory, despite its remarkable success, struggles to represent\ncertain experimental data, particularly those involving integer functions and\ndeterministic relations between quantum jumps. We address this limitation by\nproposing a hidden variable theory compatible with non-relativistic quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). Our approach introduces logical variables to describe\npropositions about the occupation of stationary states, based on three key\nassumptions: (i) the probabilities of propositions are predictable by quantum\ntheory, (ii) the truth values of propositions conform to Boolean logic, and\n(iii) propositions satisfy a novel selection rule:\n${\\rm{Tr}}[\\hat{K}(t)\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{K}^{\\dagger}(t)]={\\rm{Tr}}[({\\mathcal{P}}\\hat{K}(t))\n\\hat{\\rho}({\\mathcal{P}}\\hat{K}(t))^{\\dagger}]$. Here, $\\hat{K}(t)$ is the\nproduct of projection operators for the given propositions, and\n${\\mathcal{P}}\\hat{K}(t)$ denotes $\\hat{K}(t)$ rearranged arbitrarily. This\nselection rule extends the consistency condition in the Consistent Histories\napproach, relaxing constraints imposed by no-go theorems on logical variable\nrepresentation, joint probability existence, and measurement contextuality.\nConsequently, our theory successfully describes the essential properties of\nindividual trials, including the discreteness of quantum jumps, the continuity\nof classical trajectories, and deterministic relations between entangled\nsubsystems. It achieves this without conflicting with quantum equations of\nmotion, canonical commutation relations, or the operator ordering in quantum\ncoherence functions. The direct description of individual trials made possible\nby this approach sheds new light on the discrete nature of quantum phenomena\nand the essence of reality.",

Of particular relevance is the secondary dependence on\nhalo assembly history, known as halo assembly bias.

By analyzing these initial dependencies in\nconnection with halo assembly bias, we intend to provide insight on the\nphysical origins of the effect. To this end, we select halos at $z=0$ in the\nIllustrisTNG DM-only simulation and trace back the positions and velocities of\ntheir DM particles to $z=12$. The resulting initial regions are characterized\naccording to several shape-related and kinematic properties. The secondary bias\nsignal produced by these properties at $z=0$ is measured using an\nobject-by-object bias estimator, which offers significant analytical\nadvantages. We show that, when split by the properties of their initial DM\nclouds, $z=0$ halos display significant secondary bias, clearly exceeding the\namplitude of the well-known halo assembly bias signal produced by concentration\nand age. The maximum bias segregation is measured for cloud velocity dispersion\nand radial velocity, followed by cloud concentration, sphericity, ellipticity\nand triaxiality. We further show that both velocity dispersion and radial\nvelocity are also the properties of the initial clouds that most strongly\ncorrelate with halo age and concentration at fixed halo mass.

    "abstract": "Accurate time series forecasting is a highly valuable endeavour with\napplications across many industries. Despite recent deep learning advancements,\nincreased model complexity, and larger model sizes, many state-of-the-art\nmodels often perform worse or on par with simpler models. One of those cases is\na recently proposed model, FITS, claiming competitive performance with\nsignificantly reduced parameter counts. By training a one-layer neural network\nin the complex frequency domain, we are able to replicate these results. Our\nexperiments on a wide range of real-world datasets further reveal that FITS\nespecially excels at capturing periodic and seasonal patterns, but struggles\nwith trending, non-periodic, or random-resembling behavior. With our two novel\nhybrid approaches, where we attempt to remedy the weaknesses of FITS by\ncombining it with DLinear, we achieve the best results of any known open-source\nmodel on multivariate regression and promising results in multiple/linear\nregression on price datasets, on top of vastly improving upon what FITS\nachieves as a standalone model.",

    "abstract": "A key contribution to X-ray dark-field (XDF) is X-ray diffusion by sample\nstructures smaller than the imaging system's spatial resolution. However, some\nXDF techniques report that resolvable sample edges also generate XDF.\nSpeckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) extracts XDF by analyzing sample-imposed\nchanges to a reference speckle pattern's visibility. We present an algorithm\nfor SBXI (a variant of our Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST)\nalgorithm) capable of separating these two distinct XDF contrast mechanisms.\nThe algorithm uses the 'devolving' X-ray Imaging Fokker-Planck equation as its\nforward model and then solves the associated multimodal inverse problem, to\nretrieve sample attenuation, phase, and XDF. Previous MIST variants were based\non the evolving Fokker-Planck equation, which considers how a reference-speckle\nimage is modified by introducing a sample. The devolving perspective instead\nconsiders how the image collected in the presence of the sample and speckle\nmembrane optically flows in reverse, to generate the reference-speckle image\nwhen the sample is removed from the system. We compare single- and\nmultiple-exposure multimodal retrieval algorithms from the two Fokker-Planck\nperspectives. We demonstrate that the devolving perspective can distinguish\nbetween two physically different XDF contrast mechanisms; unresolved\nmicrostructure- and sharp-edge-induced XDF. This was verified by applying the\nretrieval algorithms to two experimental data sets. We anticipate that this\nwork will be useful in: Yielding a pair of complementary XDF images that\nseparate sharp-edge diffuse scatter from unresolved microstructure diffuse\nscatter. XDF computed tomography, where the strong edge XDF can lead to\ntainting streaking artefacts. Sample preparation, as samples will not need to\nbe embedded since the strong XDF edge signal seen between the sample and air\ncan be separated out.",

A billiard trajectory is\nthen completely characterised by the number of elastic collisions. The rules of\nmathematical billiards may be simple, but the possible behaviours of billiard\ntrajectories are endless. In fact, several fundamental theory questions in\nmathematics can be recast as billiards problems. A billiard trajectory is\ncalled a periodic orbit if the number of distinct collisions in the trajectory\nis finite. We classify all possible periodic orbits on square and rectangular\ntables. We show that periodic orbits on such billiard tables cannot have an odd\nnumber of distinct collisions. We also present a connection between the number\nof different classes of periodic orbits and Euler's totient function, which for\nany integer $N$ counts how many integers smaller than $N$ share no common\ndivisor with $N$ other than $1$. We explore how to construct periodic orbits\nwith a prescribed (even) number of distinct collisions, and investigate\nproperties of inadmissible (singular) trajectories, which are trajectories that\neventually terminate at a vertex (a table corner).",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have sparked a new\nwave of exciting AI applications. However, their high computational costs and\nmemory demands during inference pose significant challenges. Adaptive sparse\nactivation inference, which activates only a small number of neurons for each\ntoken, offers a novel way to accelerate model inference without degrading\nperformance, showing great potential for resource-constrained hardware devices.\nNevertheless, existing methods predict activated neurons based on individual\ntokens with additional MLP, which involve frequent changes in activation maps\nand resource calls, limiting the acceleration benefits of sparse activation. In\nthis paper, we introduce CoreInfer, an MLP-free adaptive sparse activation\ninference method based on sentence-level prediction. Specifically, we propose\nthe concept of sentence-wise core neurons, which refers to the subset of\nneurons most critical for a given sentence, and empirically demonstrate its\neffectiveness. To determine the core neurons, we explore the correlation\nbetween core neurons and the sentence's semantics. Remarkably, we discovered\nthat core neurons exhibit both stability and similarity in relation to the\nsentence's semantics -- an insight overlooked by previous studies. Building on\nthis finding, we further design two semantic-based methods for predicting core\nneurons to fit different input scenarios. In CoreInfer, the core neurons are\ndetermined during the pre-filling stage and fixed during the encoding stage,\nenabling zero-cost sparse inference. We evaluated the model generalization and\ntask generalization of CoreInfer across various models and tasks. Notably, on\nan NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU, CoreInfer achieved a 10.33 times and 2.72 times speedup\ncompared to the Huggingface implementation and PowerInfer, respectively.",

The\nfindings, obtained with both 3-body and 6-body numerical models, align well\nwith predictions from the epicyclic analytical theory.

    "abstract": "The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into 5G new radio (NR) has\nopened up the possibility of developing a new positioning infrastructure using\nNR signals from Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Compared to existing Global\nNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), LEO-based cellular positioning offers\nseveral advantages, such as a superior link budget, higher operating bandwidth,\nand large forthcoming constellations. Due to these factors, LEO-based\npositioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) is a potential enhancement for NTN in\n6G cellular networks. However, extending the existing terrestrial cellular\npositioning methods to LEO-based NTN positioning requires key fundamental\nenhancements. These include creating broad positioning beams orthogonal to\nconventional communication beams, time-domain processing at the user equipment\n(UE) to resolve large delay and Doppler uncertainties, and efficiently\naccommodating positioning reference signals (PRS) from multiple satellites\nwithin the communication resource grid. In this paper, we present the first set\nof design insights by incorporating these enhancements and thoroughly\nevaluating LEO-based positioning, considering the constraints and capabilities\nof the NR-NTN physical layer. To evaluate the performance of LEO-based NTN\npositioning, we develop a comprehensive NR-compliant simulation framework,\nincluding LEO orbit simulation, transmission (Tx) and receiver (Rx)\narchitectures, and a positioning engine incorporating the necessary\nenhancements. Our findings suggest that LEO-based NTN positioning could serve\nas a complementary infrastructure to GNSS and, with appropriate enhancements,\nmay also offer a viable alternative.",

The algorithm samples thrust\nprofiles according to a multivariate Laplace distribution. It is shown that\nmultivariate Laplace distributions are particularly suited to track maneuvering\nspacecraft, leading to a log probability function that is almost linear with\nthe thrust. Principles from rare event simulation theory are used to propagate\nthe tails of the distribution. Fast propagation is enabled by multi-fidelity\nmethods. Because of the diffuse transitional prior, a novel k-nearest\nneighbor-based ensemble Gaussian mixture filter is developed and used.The\nmethod allows Bayesian tracking of maneuvering spacecraft for several scenarios\nwith fewer than two measurement passes per day, and with a mismatch between the\ntrue and expected thrust magnitude of up to a factor of 200.

We address the challenges posed by real-world data that defy\nconventional assumptions, such as complex interactions within neural systems or\nhigh-dimensional dynamical systems. Leveraging insights from both theoretical\nphysics and machine learning, this work unifies diverse reduction methods under\na comprehensive framework, the Deep Variational Multivariate Information\nBottleneck. This framework enables the design of tailored reduction algorithms\nbased on specific research questions. We explore and assert the efficacy of\nsimultaneous reduction approaches over their independent reduction\ncounterparts, demonstrating their superiority in capturing covariation between\nmultiple modalities, while requiring less data. We also introduced novel\ntechniques, such as the Deep Variational Symmetric Information Bottleneck, for\ngeneral nonlinear simultaneous reduction. We show that the same principle of\nsimultaneous reduction is the key to efficient estimation of mutual\ninformation. We show that our new method is able to discover the coordinates of\nhigh-dimensional observations of dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) communication has been an important part of civil and\nmilitary communication for decades. With the increasing complexity of wireless\nenvironments and the growing number of devices sharing the spectrum, it has\nbecome critical to efficiently manage and classify the signals that populate\nthese frequencies. In such scenarios, the accurate classification of wireless\nsignals is essential for effective spectrum management, signal interception,\nand interference mitigation. However, the classification of wireless RF signals\noften faces challenges due to the limited availability of labeled training\ndata, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes the use of a Vector-Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (VQ-VAE) to augment training data, thereby enhancing the\nperformance of a baseline wireless classifier. The VQ-VAE model generates\nhigh-fidelity synthetic RF signals, increasing the diversity and fidelity of\nthe training dataset by capturing the complex variations inherent in RF\ncommunication signals. Our experimental results show that incorporating\nVQ-VAE-generated data significantly improves the classification accuracy of the\nbaseline model, particularly in low SNR conditions. This augmentation leads to\nbetter generalization and robustness of the classifier, overcoming the\nconstraints imposed by limited real-world data. By improving RF signal\nclassification, the proposed approach enhances the efficacy of wireless\ncommunication in both civil and tactical settings, ensuring reliable and secure\noperations. This advancement supports critical decision-making and operational\nreadiness in environments where communication fidelity is essential.",

Before this study, measurement error bias in nonprobability\nsurveys has mostly been overlooked and statistical methods have been devised\nfor reducing only the selection bias, under the assumption of accuracy of\nsurvey responses. Motivated by this case study, our research focuses on\ncombining two key areas in nonprobability sampling research: representativeness\nand measurement error, specifically aiming to mitigate bias from both sampling\nand measurement errors. In the context of finite population mean estimation, we\npropose a new composite estimator that integrates both probability and\nnonprobability surveys, promising improved results compared to benchmark values\nfrom large government surveys. Its performance in comparison to an existing\ncomposite estimator is analyzed in terms of mean squared error, analytically\nand empirically.

Previous work has\nsuggested an increasing trend as a function of redshift. The relevance of the\ncurrent analysis relies on investigating the selection bias method, such as the\neffect of the X-ray spectrum in high-redshift GRBs, which complicates the\nmeasurement of small NHX, have yet to be fully evaluated or discussed\nelsewhere. In this work, we evaluated these effects through simulations to\ndefine appropriate observational limits in the NHX versus redshift plane. We\nthen applied a one-sided nonparametric method developed by Efron and Petrosian.\nWithin the framework of this method, we investigated the redshift dependence of\nNHX and the local distribution function. Our results show that the evolution of\nNHX with redshift firmly exists with a significance of more than four sigma and\nfollows a power law of $(1+z)^{1.39 (+0.22, -0.27)}$. Based on these analyses\nand previous studies, the GRB progenitor mass varies but is more massive in the\nhigh redshift environment and has a higher gas column density. This suggests\nthat part of the luminosity evolution of GRBs, which has been widely reported,\nmay be due to the evolution of the progenitor's mass. Using the same method, we\ndemonstrate that optically dark GRBs show a consistent evolution as\n$(1+z)^{1.15(+0.67, -0.83)}$. By applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, it\nis shown that optically dark GRBs have statistically identical flux and photon\nindex distributions compared to normal GRBs, but the NHX is systematically\nlarger.

At present, no additional neutron star mergers have been jointly\ndetected in GW and EM radiation, but with upgrades in EM and GW facilities now\nis a chance to take stock of almost a decade of observations. We discuss the\nmotivations for following up GW sources and the basic challenges of searching\nlarge areas for a rapidly-evolving EM signal. We examine how the kilonova\ncounterpart to GW170817 was discovered and the association confirmed, and\noutline some of the key physics enabled by this discovery. We then review the\nstatus of EM searches since 2017, highlighting areas where more information (in\nGW alerts or catalogs) can improve efficiency, and discuss what we have learned\nabout kilonovae despite the lack of further multi-messenger detections. We\ndiscuss upcoming facilities and the many lessons learned, considering also how\nthese could inform searches for lensed mergers.",

Existing approaches rely on the\nrestrictive assumption that all the interactions are either observed or missed\nrandomly. We investigate what can be inferred about rankings when this\nassumption is relaxed. First, we demonstrate that in parametric models, such as\nthe popular Bradley-Terry-Luce model, rankings are point-identified if and only\nif the tournament graph is connected. Second, we show that in nonparametric\nmodels based on strong stochastic transitivity, rankings in a connected\ntournament are only partially identified. Finally, we propose two statistical\ntests to determine whether a ranking belongs to the identified set. One test is\nvalid in finite samples but computationally intensive, while the other is easy\nto implement and valid asymptotically.

However, recent research shows that a type of adversarial\nattack ($\\textit{i.e.,}$ backdoor attack) can manipulate the behavior of\nmachine learning models through contaminating their training dataset, posing\nsignificant threat in the real-world application of large pre-trained model,\nespecially for those customized models. Therefore, addressing the unique\nchallenges for exploring vulnerability of pre-trained models is of paramount\nimportance. Through empirical studies on the capability for performing backdoor\nattack in large pre-trained models ($\\textit{e.g.,}$ ViT), we find the\nfollowing unique challenges of attacking large pre-trained models: 1) the\ninability to manipulate or even access large training datasets, and 2) the\nsubstantial computational resources required for training or fine-tuning these\nmodels. To address these challenges, we establish new standards for an\neffective and feasible backdoor attack in the context of large pre-trained\nmodels. In line with these standards, we introduce our EDT model, an\n\\textbf{E}fficient, \\textbf{D}ata-free, \\textbf{T}raining-free backdoor attack\nmethod. Inspired by model editing techniques, EDT injects an editing-based\nlightweight codebook into the backdoor of large pre-trained models, which\nreplaces the embedding of the poisoned image with the target image without\npoisoning the training dataset or training the victim model. Our experiments,\nconducted across various pre-trained models such as ViT, CLIP, BLIP, and stable\ndiffusion, and on downstream tasks including image classification, image\ncaptioning, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nOur code is available in the supplementary material.",

Furthermore, we generalize the\nFloquet $X$-cube model to arbitrary manifolds, provided the lattice is locally\ncubic, consistent with its Fractonic phases. We also introduce a unified\nerror-correction paradigm for Floquet codes by defining a subgroup, the Steady\nStabilizer Group (SSG), of the Instantaneous Stabilizer Group (ISG),\nemphasizing that not all terms in the ISG contribute to error correction, but\nonly those terms that can be referred to at least twice before being removed\nfrom the ISG.

While\nspatial correlation measures, particularly Local Indicators of Spatial\nAssociation (LISA), are widely used to detect spatial patterns, the presence of\nabnormal observations frequently distorts the landscape and conceals critical\nspatial relationships. These outliers can significantly impact analysis due to\nthe inherent spatial dependencies present in the data. Traditional influence\nfunction (IF) methodologies, commonly used in statistical analysis to measure\nthe impact of individual observations, are not directly applicable in the\nspatial context because the influence of an observation is determined not only\nby its own value but also by its spatial location, its connections with\nneighboring regions, and the values of those neighboring observations. In this\npaper, we introduce a local version of the influence function (LIF) that\naccounts for these spatial dependencies.

While performant,\nthis paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL\nliterature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables\nasynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old\nsamples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However,\nasynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy\nRLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a\nworse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how\nmuch off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up\nlearning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test,\nonline DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness\nincreases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute\noptimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance\ncost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous\nRLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an\ninstruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching\nfinal performance.

In interactive LLM\napplications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request\ncompletion times, directly impacting user engagement.

As a result, traditional size-based\nscheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective\nat minimizing completion times.

This constitutes a partially observable Markov decision process\nformulation, from which we analytically derive monotonic policy structures.\nMoreover, we propose an open-loop feedback approach that enables policies\ntrained via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a simulation environment with\naccess to the true parameters to remain effective when deployed with real-time\nBayesian point estimates instead. Complementing this, we develop a Bayesian\nMarkov decision process (BMDP) framework wherein the agent maintains and\nupdates posterior distributions during deployment.

    "abstract": "During the solar cycle, the Sun's magnetic field polarity reverses due to the\nemergence, cancellation, and advection of magnetic flux towards the rotational\npoles. Flux emergence events occasionally cluster together, although it is\nunclear if this is due to the underlying solar dynamo or simply by chance.\nRegardless of the cause, we aim to characterise how the reversal of the Sun's\nmagnetic field and the structure of the solar corona are influenced by nested\nflux emergence. From the spherical harmonic decomposition of the Sun's\nphotospheric magnetic field, we identify times when the reversal of the dipole\ncomponent stalls for several solar rotations. Using observations from sunspot\ncycle 23 to present, we locate the nested active regions responsible for each\nstalling and explore their impact on the coronal magnetic field using potential\nfield source surface extrapolations. Nested flux emergence has a more\nsignificant impact on the topology of the coronal magnetic field than isolated\nemergences as it produces a coherent (low spherical harmonic order)\ncontribution to the photospheric magnetic field. The heliospheric current sheet\n(HCS), that separates oppositely directed coronal magnetic field, can become\nanchored above these regions due to the formation of strong opposing magnetic\nfluxes. Further flux emergence, cancellation, differential rotation, and\ndiffusion, then effectively advects the HCS and shifts the dipole axis. Nested\nflux emergence can restrict the evolution of the HCS and impede the reversal of\nthe coronal magnetic field. The sources of the solar wind can be more\nconsistently identified around nested active regions as the magnetic field\ntopology remains self-similar for multiple solar rotations. This highlights the\nimportance of identifying nested active regions to guide the remote-sensing\nobservations of modern heliophysics missions.",

Given their prevalence, it is timely to\ninvestigate open source co-opetition in such contexts. Towards this end, we\nconduct a mixed-methods analysis of three company-hosted OSS projects in the\nartificial intelligence (AI) industry: Meta's PyTorch (prior to its donation to\nthe Linux Foundation), Google's TensorFlow, and Hugging Face's Transformers. We\ncontribute three key findings. First, while the projects exhibit similar code\nauthorship patterns between host and external companies (80%/20% of commits),\ncollaborations are structured differently (e.g., decentralised vs.\nhub-and-spoke networks). Second, host and external companies engage in\nstrategic, non-strategic, and contractual collaborations, with varying\nincentives and collaboration practices. Some of the observed collaborations are\nspecific to the AI industry (e.g., hardware-software optimizations or AI model\nintegrations), while others are typical of the broader software industry (e.g.,\nbug fixing or task outsourcing). Third, single-vendor governance creates a\npower imbalance that influences open source co-opetition practices and\npossibilities, from the host company's singular decision-making power (e.g.,\nthe risk of license change) to their community involvement strategy (e.g., from\nover-control to over-delegation).

Despite significant progress\nin various simulation aspects, such as graphical realism, an evident gap\npersists between the virtual and real-world environments. Since the ultimate\ngoal is to deploy the autonomous systems in the real world, reducing the\nsim2real gap is of utmost importance. In this paper, we employ a\nstate-of-the-art approach to enhance the photorealism of simulated data,\naligning them with the visual characteristics of real-world datasets. Based on\nthis, we developed CARLA2Real, an easy-to-use, publicly available tool\n(plug-in) for the widely used and open-source CARLA simulator. This tool\nenhances the output of CARLA in near real-time, achieving a frame rate of 13\nFPS, translating it to the visual style and realism of real-world datasets such\nas Cityscapes, KITTI, and Mapillary Vistas. By employing the proposed tool, we\ngenerated synthetic datasets from both the simulator and the enhancement model\noutputs, including their corresponding ground truth annotations for tasks\nrelated to autonomous driving. Then, we performed a number of experiments to\nevaluate the impact of the proposed approach on feature extraction and semantic\nsegmentation methods when trained on the enhanced synthetic data. The results\ndemonstrate that the sim2real appearance gap is significant and can indeed be\nreduced by the introduced approach.

In European and North American data\nfrom 1400 to 1950 we find two distinct patterns of lifetime migration. The\nsteady-state pattern shows a universal power-law distribution of migration\ndistance; by its early appearance it cannot be dependent on post-industrial\ntechnology. The frontier pattern, in contrast, is not scale-free with its much\nlonger average distances. All migration distances are well fit by a three\nparameter model; the temporal and geographic patterns of the fitted parameters\ngive new insight to American internal expansion 1620-1950. Frontier migration\nis also highly directional and asymmetric; gravity models do not apply. The\nAmerican frontier pattern arose from the colonial-era steady-state within a\ngeneration, plateaued for three generations, then returned to a more mobile\nsteady-state, a sequence paralleled by the Steppe migrations that brought the\nBronze Age to Neolithic Europe. The transient frontier pattern is enabled by\nlarge-scale technological or numeric imbalance and geographic opportunity; when\nthese forces abate, a new steady-state begins.",

The HPSQ C total score was\nestimated with a minimum error equal to 10.34 %. Children with DD spent\nsignificantly higher time in-air, they had a higher number of pen elevations, a\nbigger height of on-surface strokes, a lower in-air tempo, and a higher\nvariation in the angular velocity. Although this study shows a promising impact\nof DD assessment via display tablets, it also accents the fact that modelling\nof subjective scores is challenging and a complex and data-driven\nquantification of DD manifestations is needed.",

Despite the numerous registration models that have been proposed,\nexisting methods still fall short in terms of accuracy and interpretability. In\nthis paper, we present MsMorph, a deep learning-based image registration\nframework aimed at mimicking the manual process of registering image pairs to\nachieve more similar deformations, where the registered image pairs exhibit\nconsistency or similarity in features. By extracting the feature differences\nbetween image pairs across various as-pects using gradients, the framework\ndecodes semantic information at different scales and continuously compen-sates\nfor the predicted deformation field, driving the optimization of parameters to\nsignificantly improve registration accuracy. The proposed method simulates the\nmanual approach to registration, focusing on different regions of the image\npairs and their neighborhoods to predict the deformation field between the two\nimages, which provides strong interpretability. We compared several existing\nregistration methods on two public brain MRI datasets, including LPBA and\nMindboggle. The experimental results show that our method consistently\noutperforms state of the art in terms of metrics such as Dice score, Hausdorff\ndistance, average symmetric surface distance, and non-Jacobian.

This estimation is logical and true when a large-size RT is\ninvestigated.

    "abstract": "Many legal computations, including the amount of tax owed by a citizen,\nwhether they are eligible to social benefits, or the wages due to civil state\nservants, are specified by computational laws. Their application, however, is\nperformed by expert computer programs intended to faithfully transcribe the law\ninto computer code. Bugs in these programs can lead to dramatic societal\nimpact, e.g., paying employees incorrect amounts, or not awarding benefits to\nfamilies in need.\n  To address this issue, we consider concolic unit testing, a combination of\nconcrete execution with SMT-based symbolic execution, and propose CUTECat, a\nconcolic execution tool targeting implementations of computational laws. Such\nlaws typically follow a pattern where a base case is later refined by many\nexceptions in following law articles, a pattern that can be formally modeled\nusing default logic. We show how to handle default logic inside a concolic\nexecution tool, and implement our approach in the context of Catala, a recent\ndomain-specific language tailored to implement computational laws. We evaluate\nCUTECat on several programs, including the Catala implementation of the French\nhousing benefits and Section 132 of the US tax code. We show that CUTECat can\nsuccessfully generate hundreds of thousands of testcases covering all branches\nof these bodies of law. Through several heuristics, we improve CUTECat's\nscalability and usability, making the testcases understandable by lawyers and\nprogrammers alike. We believe CUTECat thus paves the way for the use of formal\nmethods during legislative processes.",

We take a further\nstep to understand fine-tuning attacks in multilingual LLMs. We first discover\ncross-lingual generalization of fine-tuning attacks: using a few adversarially\nchosen instruction-following examples in one language, multilingual LLMs can\nalso be easily compromised (e.g., multilingual LLMs fail to refuse harmful\nprompts in other languages). Motivated by this finding, we hypothesize that\nsafety-related information is language-agnostic and propose a new method termed\nSafety Information Localization (SIL) to identify the safety-related\ninformation in the model parameter space. Through SIL, we validate this\nhypothesis and find that only changing 20% of weight parameters in fine-tuning\nattacks can break safety alignment across all languages. Furthermore, we\nprovide evidence to the alternative pathways hypothesis for why freezing\nsafety-related parameters does not prevent fine-tuning attacks, and we\ndemonstrate that our attack vector can still jailbreak LLMs adapted to new\nlanguages.",

Thus, discovery of\nsuch a DM candidate can possibly open the window for post-inflationary\ndynamics. However, there are several challenges in this exercise, as\nfreezing-in DM possesses feeble interaction with the visible sector and\ntherefore very low production cross-section at the collider. We show that\nmono-photon (and dilepton) signal at the ILC, arising from DM effective\noperators connected to the SM field strength tensors, can still warrant a\nsignal discovery. We study both the scalar and fermionic DM production during\nreheating via UV freeze-in, when the inflaton oscillates at the bottom of a\ngeneral monomial potential. Interestingly, we see, right DM abundance can be\nachieved only in the case of bosonic reheating scenario, satisfying bounds from\nbig bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This provides a unique correlation between\ncollider signal and the post-inflationary dynamics of the Universe within\nsingle-field inflationary models.",

In this work,\nwe introduce a novel class of \"pseudochaotic\" quantum Hamiltonians that\nfundamentally challenges the conventional understanding of quantum chaos and\nits relationship to computational complexity. Our ensemble is computationally\nindistinguishable from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of\nstrongly-interacting Hamiltonians, widely considered to be a quintessential\nmodel for quantum chaos. Surprisingly, despite this effective\nindistinguishability, our Hamiltonians lack all conventional signatures of\nchaos: it exhibits Poissonian level statistics, low operator complexity, and\nweak scrambling properties. This stark contrast between efficient computational\nindistinguishability and traditional chaos indicators calls into question\nfundamental assumptions about the nature of quantum chaos. We, furthermore,\ngive an efficient quantum algorithm to simulate Hamiltonians from our ensemble,\neven though simulating Hamiltonians from the true GUE is known to require\nexponential time. Our work establishes fundamental limitations on Hamiltonian\nlearning and testing protocols and derives stronger bounds on entanglement and\nmagic state distillation. These results reveal a surprising separation between\ncomputational and information-theoretic perspectives on quantum chaos, opening\nnew avenues for research at the intersection of quantum chaos, computational\ncomplexity, and quantum information.

The C/O ratio in particular can be used to approximately place a\nplanet's initial formation radius from the stellar host, but a given C/O ratio\nmay not be unique to formation location.

This object's spectrum\nincludes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to\nits high ionization potential energy ($\\sim$ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to\nsimultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy\ncontributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry.

In this\nwork, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS\nobservations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star\nshowing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H$_2$O,\nOH, and CO$_2$, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C$_2$H$_2$ and\nC$_4$H$_2$. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different\nspatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare\nthe column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals.\nWe find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have\ncarbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of\nC$_2$H$_2$ with models that have C/O $=$ 2$-$4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich\ndust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich\nchemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot\nline. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as\nindicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this\nlong-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a\nconsequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central\nstar, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing\nthe chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.",

For individual HII\nregions, $I_\\mathrm{FIR}$ is initially high in the vicinity of young stars, and\nthen moderately decreases as the gas is compressed into shells. In contrast,\n$I_\\mathrm{CII}$ drops strongly over time, to which the second ionisation of\nC$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ contributes. This leads to a large drop in\n$I_\\mathrm{[CII]}/I_\\mathrm{FIR}$ inside HII regions, decreasing from\n10$^{-3}$-10$^{-2}$ at scales above 10 pc to 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-4}$ at scales\nbelow 2pc. However, projection effects can affect the radial profile of\n$I_\\mathrm{[CII]}$ and $I_\\mathrm{FIR}$ and create apparent HII regions without\nany stars. On MC scales, $L_\\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\\mathrm{FIR}$ decreases from\nvalues $\\gtrsim$10$^{-2}$ in MCs without star formation to values around\n$\\sim10^{-3}$ in MCs with star formation. We attribute this and the origin of\nthe [CII] deficit to two main contributors: (i) the saturation of the [CII]\nline and (ii) the conversion of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ by stellar radiation. The\ndrop in $L_\\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\\mathrm{FIR}$ can be divided into two phases: (i)\nearly on, the saturation of [CII] and the further ionisation of C$^+$ limit the\nincrease in $L_\\mathrm{[CII]}$, while $L_\\mathrm{FIR}$ increases rapidly,\nleading to the initial decline of $L_\\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\\mathrm{FIR}$. (ii) In\nmore evolved HII regions, $L_\\mathrm{CII}$ stagnates and even partially drops\ndue to the aforementioned reasons. $L_\\mathrm{FIR}$ stagnates as the gas gets\npushed into the cooler shells keeping $L_\\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\\mathrm{FIR}$ at low\nvalues of $\\sim10^{-3}$.",

For most known planets, including the Solar\nSystem giants, this is difficult as they reside in a temperature regime where\nonly volatile elements (e.g., C, O) can be measured, while refractories (e.g.,\nFe, Ni) are condensed to deep layers of the atmosphere where they cannot be\nremotely probed. With temperatures allowing for even rock-forming elements to\nbe in the gas phase, ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres provide a unique opportunity\nto simultaneously probe the volatile and refractory content of giant planets.\nHere we directly measure and obtain bounded constraints on the abundances of\nvolatile C and O as well as refractory Fe and Ni on the ultra-hot giant\nexoplanet WASP-121b. We find that ice-forming elements are comparatively\nenriched relative to rock-forming elements, potentially indicating that\nWASP-121b formed in a volatile-rich environment much farther away from the star\nthan where it is currently located.

A major challenge lies in the identification and characterization of\nthe different sources of noise that may hamper their sensitivity to GWs. The\npresence of time-correlated noise that resembles the target signal might give\nrise to degeneracies that can directly impact the detection statistics. In this\nwork, we focus on the covariance that exists between a \"chromatic\" dispersion\nmeasure (DM) noise and an \"achromatic\" stochastic gravitational wave background\n(GWB). \"Chromatic\" associated to the DM noise means that its amplitude depends\non the frequency of the incoming pulsar photons measured by the\nradio-telescope. Several frequency channels are then required to accurately\ncharacterise its chromatic features and when the coverage of incoming frequency\nis poor, it becomes impossible to disentangle chromatic and achromatic noise\ncontributions. In this paper, we explore this situation by injecting realistic\nGWB into 100 realizations of two mock versions of the second data release (DR2)\nof the European PTA (EPTA), characterized by different frequency coverage. The\nfirst dataset is a faithful copy of DR2, in which the first half of the data is\ndominated by only one frequency channel of observation; the second one is\nidentical except for a more homogeneous frequency coverage across the full\ndataset. We show that for 91% of the injections, a better frequency coverage\nleads to an improved statistical significance (~1.3dex higher log Bayes factor\non average) of the GWB and a better characterization of its properties. We\npropose a metric to quantify the degeneracy between DM and GWB parameters and\nshow that it is correlated with a loss of significance for the recovered GWB\nand an increase in the GWB bias towards a higher and flatter spectral shape.",

    "abstract": "Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory\ncalculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three\ndenominators in $d=4-2\\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts\nrelations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations\nand a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential\nequation approach we establish results up to order $\\varepsilon$ for general\ninteger exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of\nmasses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general\ndimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the\nrequired amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a\nterm contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the\n$\\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen\nfunctions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic\ngeometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space\ncalculations with multiple observed final-state particles.",

    "abstract": "Quantum algorithms for linear systems produce the solution state\n$A^{-1}|b\\rangle$ by querying two oracles: $O_A$ that block encodes the\ncoefficient matrix and $O_b$ that prepares the initial state.

This\ncontrasts with recent results achieving\n$\\mathbf{O}\\left(\\kappa\\log\\left({1}/{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)$ complexity to\nboth oracles, which, while optimal in $O_A$, is highly suboptimal in $O_b$ as\n$\\kappa$ can be arbitrarily larger than $1/\\sqrt{p}$. In various applications\nsuch as solving differential equations, preparing ground states of operators\nwith real spectra, and estimating and transforming eigenvalues of non-normal\nmatrices, we can further improve the dependence on $p$ using a block\npreconditioning scheme to nearly match or outperform best previous results\nbased on other methods, which also furnishes an extremely simple quantum linear\nsystem algorithm with an optimal query complexity to $O_A$.

    "abstract": "Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous sources of information worldwide,\nspanning a wide variety of domains. This inherent heterogeneity has slowed the\ndevelopment of Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) capable of fast generalization\nto unseen datasets. In-Context Learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a\npromising solution for TFMs, enabling dynamic adaptation to new tasks without\nadditional tuning. While many studies have attempted to re-purpose large\nlanguage models for tabular ICL, they have had limited success, so recent works\nhave focused on developing tabular-specific foundation models. In this work, we\npropose an approach to combine ICL-based retrieval with self supervised\nlearning to train tabular foundation models. We also investigate the utility of\nreal vs. synthetic data for model pre-training, and show that real data can\ncontain useful signal not easily captured in synthetic training. Specifically,\nwe show that incorporating real data during the pre-training phase can lead to\nsignificantly faster training and better downstream generalization to unseen\ndata. Our resulting model, TabDPT, achieves top performance on both regression\n(CTR23) and classification (CC18) benchmarks. Importantly, we also demonstrate\nthat with our pre-training procedure, scaling both model and data size leads to\nconsistent performance improvements that follow power laws. This echoes scaling\nlaws in LLMs and other foundation models, and suggests that Internet-scale TFMs\ncan be achievable. We open-source our full pipeline: inference code including\ntrained model weights can be found at\ngithub.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference, and the training code to reproduce\nexperiments can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training.",

For\nvertex operator algebras, the term \"topological manipulations\" refers to\noperations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal\nsubalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like\ngauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or\ninterpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite\nquantum dimension.\n  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices and tensor categories, we\nsay that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if\ntheir central charges agree and if their modular tensor categories are Witt\nequivalent. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges\nagree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated\nby a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two\ntheories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is\nalso sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.\n  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to\nlore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the\nnotion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of\nunitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite symmetries of the $SU(2)_1$\nWess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. We also sketch a \"quantum Galois\ntheory\" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by\nincorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible\nGalois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce two\nFibonacci lines.

In this\nwork, we address this gap by extending known unitary models for the acquisition\nof quantum knowledge to account for the resources an agent has access to; in\nparticular the dimension of their probe system. We view an agent's knowledge of\na quantum state as their ability to reconstruct it unitarily. In our model an\nagent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system with copies of a lower\n$k$-dimensional probe, which they then use to reconstruct estimates of the\nstate in $d$-dimensional memories.

We find that\nonly a handful of these sources will be detectable with signal-to-noise ratio\nlarger than 8: about 5 sources on average in 4 years of mission duration, among\nwhich only one or two are multiband ones (i.e. merging in less than 15 years).\nWe find that detectable sources have chirp mass $10 M_\\odot<M_c<100 M_\\odot$,\nresidual time-to-coalescence $4yr<t_c<100yr$, and redshift $z<0.1$, much closer\nthan those observed up to now by ground-based detectors. We also explore\ncorrelations between the number of LISA detectable sources and the parameters\nof the population, suggesting that a joint measurement with the stochastic\nsignal might be informative of the population characteristics. By performing\nparameter estimation on a subset of sources from the catalogues, we conclude\nthat, even if LISA measurements will not be directly informative on the\npopulation due to the low number of resolvable sources, it will characterise a\nfew, low-redshift candidates with great precision. Furthermore, we construct\nfor the first time the LISA waterfall plot for low chirp-mass systems, as a\nfunction of their time to coalescence and inclination.

    "abstract": "Spindle and disc solutions have received significant attention in recent\nliterature. However, it is not entirely clear what these supergravity solutions\nrepresent in the dual SCFT. In this work we elucidate this issue by considering\na different global completion of the spindle solution, focusing on a single\nconical defect. We argue that these solutions can be interpreted as the\ninsertion of a single (generalised) Gukov-Witten defect in the bulk SCFT. We\ngive compelling evidence for this claim by uplifting the solutions to type IIB\nsupergravity and showing that the five-dimensional $\\frac{1}{2}$-BPS solutions\nuplifts to the bubbling surface operators solutions. Their less supersymmetric\ncousins give rise to a large class of holographic generalised Gukov-Witten\nsurface operators for which we perform a detailed geometric analysis. To\ncorroborate these claims we compute a variety of holographic observables such\nas the renormalised action, stress tensor one-point function and defect\nentanglement entropy. In addition, we extend the holographic inflow mechanism\nto account for bulk-to-defect inflow to study the symmetries and anomalies of\nthe bulk and defect.",

    "abstract": "Urban scene generation has been developing rapidly recently. However,\nexisting methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes,\noverlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments.\nIn this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D occupancy generation\nframework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality dynamic 4D scenes\nwith semantics. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model\nfor learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive\naveraging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to\neffectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane\nconstruction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to\n12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to\nreconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network\ntraining efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D\npoint (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory\nreduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make\nHexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to\nreorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map.\nIn particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or\nsampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as\ntrajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned\ngeneration. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate\nthat DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D\noccupancy generation methods across multiple metrics. The code and models have\nbeen released to facilitate future research.",

Motivated by the shared\nprinciples between these tasks, they require recovering and preserving fine\nimage details, whether by enhancing resolution for SISR or reconstructing\ncompressed data for Image Compression. Unlike previous methods that mainly\nfocus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a\nbasis-coefficient decomposition as well as an explicit formulation of\nfrequencies to capture structural components and multi-scale visual features in\nimages, which addresses the core challenges of both tasks. We replace the\nrepresentation of prior models from simple feature maps with Factorized\nFeatures to validate the potential for broad generalizability. In addition, we\nfurther optimize the pipelines by leveraging the mergeable-basis property of\nour Factorized Features, which consolidates shared structures on multi-frame\ncompression and super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that our unified\nrepresentation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average\nrelative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution\n(SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous\nSOTA.",

However, uniform\nreplay is inefficient, since certain classes of transitions can be more\nrelevant to learning. While prioritization of more useful samples is helpful,\nthis strategy can also lead to overfitting, as useful samples are likely to be\nmore rare. In this work, we instead propose a prioritized, parametric version\nof an agent's memory, using generative models to capture online experience.\nThis paradigm enables (1) densification of past experience, with new\ngenerations that benefit from the generative model's generalization capacity\nand (2) guidance via a family of \"relevance functions\" that push these\ngenerations towards more useful parts of an agent's acquired history. We show\nthis recipe can be instantiated using conditional diffusion models and simple\nrelevance functions such as curiosity- or value-based metrics. Our approach\nconsistently improves performance and sample efficiency in both state- and\npixel-based domains. We expose the mechanisms underlying these gains, showing\nhow guidance promotes diversity in our generated transitions and reduces\noverfitting.

Building upon our\ncharacterization of the Corona Australis (CrA) chain, we now analyze two\nadditional major cluster chains that exhibit similar characteristics: the Lower\nCentaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco) chains. All three cluster\nchains display distinct sequential patterns in 1) the 3D spatial distribution,\n2) age, 3) velocity, and 4) mass. The Upper-Sco chain is the most massive and\ncomplex cluster chain, possibly consisting of two or more overlapping\nsubchains. We discuss the possible formation of cluster chains and argue for a\nscenario where feedback from the most massive star formation episode 15 Myr ago\ninitiated the formation of these spatio-temporal cluster sequences. Our results\nidentify cluster chains as a distinct type of stellar structure with\nwell-defined physical properties, formed in environments capable of sustaining\nstellar feedback over timescales of 5-10 Myr. We find that around 40% of the\nstellar population in Sco-Cen formed due to triggered star formation, with 35%\nforming along the three cluster chains. We conclude that cluster chains could\nbe common structures in OB associations, particularly in regions that have\nsimilar natal environments as Sco-Cen.

We observed at the IRAM 30 m telescope the CO(1-0)\nand CO(2-1) emission of 106 void galaxies selected from the CAVITY survey.\nTogether with data from the literature, we obtained a sample of 200 void\ngalaxies with CO data. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the specific\nstar formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_*$), the molecular gas fraction\n(MH$_2$/M$_*$), and the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR/MH$_2$) between\nthe void galaxies and a comparison sample of galaxies in filaments and walls,\nselected from the xCOLD GASS survey. We found no statistically significant\ndifference between void galaxies and the comparison sample in the molecular gas\nfraction as a function of stellar mass for galaxies on the star-forming main\nsequence (SFMS). However, for void galaxies, the SFE was found to be constant\nacross all stellar mass bins, while there is a decreasing trend with M$_*$ for\nthe comparison sample. Finally, we found some indications for a smaller\ndynamical range in the molecular gas fraction as a function of distance to the\nSFMS in void galaxies. Overall, our analysis finds that the molecular gas\nproperties of void galaxies are not very different from denser environments.\nThe physical origin of the most significant difference that we found - a\nconstant SFE as a function of stellar mass in void galaxies - is unclear and\nrequires further investigation and higher-resolution data.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in predictive models have demonstrated exceptional\ncapabilities in predicting the future state of objects and scenes. However, the\nlack of categorization based on inherent characteristics continues to hinder\nthe progress of predictive model development. Additionally, existing benchmarks\nare unable to effectively evaluate higher-capability, highly embodied\npredictive models from an embodied perspective. In this work, we classify the\nfunctionalities of predictive models into a hierarchy and take the first step\nin evaluating World Simulators by proposing a dual evaluation framework called\nWorldSimBench. WorldSimBench includes Explicit Perceptual Evaluation and\nImplicit Manipulative Evaluation, encompassing human preference assessments\nfrom the visual perspective and action-level evaluations in embodied tasks,\ncovering three representative embodied scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied\nEnvironment, Autonomous, Driving, and Robot Manipulation. In the Explicit\nPerceptual Evaluation, we introduce the HF-Embodied Dataset, a video assessment\ndataset based on fine-grained human feedback, which we use to train a Human\nPreference Evaluator that aligns with human perception and explicitly assesses\nthe visual fidelity of World Simulators. In the Implicit Manipulative\nEvaluation, we assess the video-action consistency of World Simulators by\nevaluating whether the generated situation-aware video can be accurately\ntranslated into the correct control signals in dynamic environments. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation offers key insights that can drive further innovation\nin video generation models, positioning World Simulators as a pivotal\nadvancement toward embodied artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have received much\nattention for their impressive capabilities. The evaluation of MLLMs is\nbecoming critical to analyzing attributes of MLLMs and providing valuable\ninsights. However, current benchmarks overlook the problem of prompt\nsensitivity - minor prompt variations may lead to significant performance\nfluctuations. Thus, inappropriate prompts may obscure the models' capabilities,\nunderestimating the models' performance. Moreover, different models have\ndifferent preferences for different prompts, and thus, using the same prompt\nfor all models will cause evaluation bias. This paper analyzes this deficiency\nin existing benchmarks and further introduces a new evaluation framework named\nTP-Eval, which introduces a prompt customization method to reduce evaluation\nbiases and tap models' potential. TP-Eval will rewrite the original prompts to\ndifferent customized prompts for different models. In particular, we propose\nsome well-designed modules for prompt customization tailored to the scenario of\nMLLM evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach to uncovering models' capabilities, and TP-Eval should benefit the\ncommunity in developing more comprehensive and convincing MLLM evaluation\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "According to a result of Wigner and von Neumann [1], real symmetric matrices\nwith a doubly degenerate lowest eigenvalue form a submanifold of codimension 2\nwithin the space of all real symmetric matrices. This mathematical result has\nimportant consequences for chemistry. First, it implies that degeneracies do\nnot occur within generic one-parameter families of real symmetric matrices -\nthis is the famous non-crossing rule, and is responsible for the phenomenon of\navoided crossings in the energy levels of diatomic molecules. Second, it\nimplies that energy levels are expected to cross in polyatomic molecules, with\ncrossings taking place on a submanifold of nuclear configuration space which is\ncodimension 2 - this submanifold is the famous conical intersection seam, of\ncentral importance in nonadiabatic chemistry. In this paper we extend the\nanalysis of Wigner and von Neumann to include symmetry. We introduce a symmetry\ngroup, and consider parametrised families of matrices which respect an action\nof that symmetry group on both the parameter space and on the space of\nmatrices. A concrete application is to molecules, for which the relevant\nsymmetry group is generated by permutations of atomic nuclei combined with\nspatial reflections and rotations. In the presence of this extra symmetry, we\nfind that energy level crossings do not typically occur on codimension 2\nsubmanifolds, and connect our findings with the discovery of confluences of\nconical intersection seams in the chemical literature. We give a classification\nof confluences for triatomic molecules and planar molecules, unifying the\nprevious literature on this topic, and predict several new types of confluence.",

In this paper, we propose a strategic\nclassification model that considers behavioral biases in human responses to\nalgorithms. We show how misperceptions of a classifier (specifically, of its\nfeature weights) can lead to different types of discrepancies between biased\nand rational agents' responses, and identify when behavioral agents over- or\nunder-invest in different features. We also show that strategic agents with\nbehavioral biases can benefit or (perhaps, unexpectedly) harm the firm compared\nto fully rational strategic agents. We complement our analytical results with\nuser studies, which support our hypothesis of behavioral biases in human\nresponses to the algorithm. Together, our findings highlight the need to\naccount for human (cognitive) biases when designing AI systems, and providing\nexplanations of them, to strategic human in the loop.",

The length of string can be characterised in\nterms of standard dimensionless parameters $\\zeta_\\text{w}$ and\n$\\zeta_\\text{r}$, the length density measured in the cosmic rest frame and the\nstring rest frame, scaled with the cosmic time. The motion of the string can be\ncharacterised by the root-mean-square (RMS) velocity of the string. Starting\nfrom a range of initial length densities and velocities, we analyse the string\nnetwork in the standard scaling framework and find evolution towards a fixed\npoint with estimated values $\\hat{\\zeta}_{\\text{w},*} = 1.220(57)$ and\n$\\hat{\\zeta}_{\\text{r},*} = 1.491(93)$. The two measures are related by the RMS\nvelocity, which we estimate to be $\\hat{v}_{*} = 0.5705(93)$. The length\ndensity is consistent with previous measurements, while the velocity is about\n5% lower. For simulations starting from low enough density, the length density\nparameters $\\zeta_\\text{w}$ and $\\zeta_\\text{r}$ remain below their fixed point\nvalues throughout, while growing slowly, giving rise to an impression of\napproximately logarithmic increase with time. This has been proposed as the\ntrue long-term behaviour. We find that the growth tends to slow down as the\nvalues of $\\zeta_\\text{w}$ and $\\zeta_\\text{r}$ identified as fixed points are\napproached. In the case of $\\zeta_\\text{r}$, the growth stops for simulations\nwhich started close to the fixed point length density. The difference between\n$\\zeta_\\text{w}$ and $\\zeta_\\text{r}$ can be understood to result from the\ncontinuing velocity evolution. Our results indicate that the growth of\n$\\zeta_\\text{w}$ is a transient appearing at low densities and while the\nvelocity is converging.

We introduce the notion of factor\nargument independence to address the outstanding question of defining when\narguments should be presented jointly or separately and present an algorithm\nthat, starting from the evidence nodes and a target node, produces a list of\nall independent factor arguments ordered by their strength. Finally, we\nimplemented a scheme to build natural language explanations of Bayesian\nReasoning using this approach. Our proposal has been validated in the medical\ndomain through a human-driven evaluation study where we compare the Bayesian\nNetwork Reasoning explanations obtained using factor arguments with an\nalternative explanation method. Evaluation results indicate that our proposed\nexplanation approach is deemed by users as significantly more useful for\nunderstanding Bayesian Network Reasoning than another existing explanation\nmethod it is compared to.",

For a wide class of {\\em local} matching algorithms,\nnamely, algorithms that only use information on the immediate neighborhood of\nthe explored nodes, we propose a joint construction of the graph by the\nconfiguration model, and of the resulting matching on the latter graph. This\nleads to a generalization in infinite dimension of the differential equation\nmethod of Wormald: We keep track of the matching algorithm over time by a\nmeasure-valued CTMC, for which we prove the convergence, to the large-graph\nlimit, to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit, identified as the unique solution\nof a system of ODE's in the space of integer measures. Then, the asymptotic\nproportion of nodes covered by the matching appears as a simple function of\nthat solution. We then make this solution explicit for three particular local\nalgorithms: the classical {\\sc greedy} algorithm, and then the {\\sc uni-min}\nand {\\sc uni-max} algorithms, two variants of the greedy algorithm that select,\nas neighbor of any explored node, its neighbor having the least (respectively\nlargest) residual degree.",

    "abstract": "System call filtering is widely used to secure programs in multi-tenant\nenvironments, and to sandbox applications in modern desktop software deployment\nand package management systems. Filtering rules are hard to write and maintain\nmanually, hence generating them automatically is essential. To that aim,\nanalysis tools able to identify every system call that can legitimately be\ninvoked by a program are needed. Existing static analysis works lack precision\nbecause of a high number of false positives, and/or assume the availability of\nprogram/libraries source code -- something unrealistic in many scenarios such\nas cloud production environments.\n  We present B-Side, a static binary analysis tool able to identify a superset\nof the system calls that an x86-64 static/dynamic executable may invoke at\nruntime. B-Side assumes no access to program/libraries sources, and shows a\ngood degree of precision by leveraging symbolic execution, combined with a\nheuristic to detect system call wrappers, which represent an important source\nof precision loss in existing works. B-Side also allows to statically detect\nphases of execution in a program in which different filtering rules can be\napplied. We validate B-Side and demonstrate its higher precision compared to\nstate-of-the-art works: over a set of popular applications, B-Side's average\n$F_1$ score is 0.81, vs. 0.31 and 0.53 for competitors. Over 557 static and\ndynamically-compiled binaries taken from the Debian repositories, B-Side\nidentifies an average of 43 system calls, vs. 271 and 95 for two state-of-the\nart competitors. We further evaluate the strictness of the phase-based\nfiltering policies that can be obtained with B-Side.",

However, its chunking strategy\ndisrupts the global long-context information, and its low-quality retrieval in\nlong contexts hinders LLMs from identifying effective factual details due to\nsubstantial noise. To this end, we propose LongRAG, a general,\ndual-perspective, and robust LLM-based RAG system paradigm for LCQA to enhance\nRAG's understanding of complex long-context knowledge (i.e., global information\nand factual details). We design LongRAG as a plug-and-play paradigm,\nfacilitating adaptation to various domains and LLMs. Extensive experiments on\nthree multi-hop datasets demonstrate that LongRAG significantly outperforms\nlong-context LLMs (up by 6.94%), advanced RAG (up by 6.16%), and Vanilla RAG\n(up by 17.25%).

This multi-index model arises from\nthe tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem with multiple spikes,\nwhere the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors within the\n$N$-dimensional unit sphere through maximum likelihood estimation from noisy\nobservations of a $p$-tensor. We determine the number of samples and the\nconditions on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to efficiently recover\nthe unknown spikes from natural random initializations. We show that full\nrecovery of all spikes is possible provided a number of sample scaling as\n$N^{p-2}$, matching the algorithmic threshold identified in the rank-one case\n[Ben Arous, Gheissari, Jagannath 2020, 2021]. Our results are obtained through\na detailed analysis of a low-dimensional system that describes the evolution of\nthe correlations between the estimators and the spikes, while controlling the\nnoise in the dynamics. We find that the spikes are recovered sequentially in a\nprocess we term \"sequential elimination\": once a correlation exceeds a critical\nthreshold, all correlations sharing a row or column index become sufficiently\nsmall, allowing the next correlation to grow and become macroscopic. The order\nin which correlations become macroscopic depends on their initial values and\nthe corresponding SNRs, leading to either exact recovery or recovery of a\npermutation of the spikes.

    "abstract": "Lipid membranes, fundamental to cellular function, undergo various mechanical\ndeformations. Accurate modeling of these processes necessitates a thorough\nunderstanding of membrane elasticity. The lateral shear modulus, a critical\nparameter describing membrane resistance to lateral stresses, remains elusive\ndue to the membrane's fluid nature. Two contrasting hypotheses, local fluidity\nand global fluidity, have been proposed. While the former suggests a zero local\nlateral shear modulus anywhere within lipid monolayers, the latter posits that\nonly the integral of this modulus over the monolayer thickness vanishes. These\ndiffering models lead to distinct estimations of other elastic moduli and\naffect the modeling of biological processes, such as membrane fusion/fission\nand membrane-mediated interactions. Notably, they predict distinct local stress\ndistributions in cylindrically curved membranes. The local fluidity model\nproposes isotropic local lateral stress, whereas the global fluidity model\npredicts anisotropy due to anisotropic local lateral stretching of lipid\nmonolayers. Using molecular dynamics simulations, this study directly\ninvestigates these models by analyzing local stress in a cylindrically curved\nmembrane. The results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a static local\nlateral shear stress and anisotropy in local lateral stress within the\nmonolayers of the cylindrical membrane, strongly supporting the global fluidity\nmodel.

We then systematically compare these\ncatalogs with an existing catalog which utilized a traditional workflow.\nResults indicate that the Pickblue-based catalog documents more events and/or\nprovides better-constrained locations than the other catalogs. The different\nperformances of the three phase pickers suggest that detailed assessment of\ncatalogs built using automatic workflows is necessary to prevent\nmisinterpretations, especially when applied to regions without training\nsamples. The Pickblue-based catalog reveals seismicity gaps in three\nextensional segments of BTF which likely represent aseismic slip zones affected\nby seawater infiltration. Furthermore, most earthquakes are shallower than the\n600-degree isotherm predicted by a half-space conductive cooling model, except\nfor the Blanco Ridge segment which has hosted 80% of the Mw > 6.0 earthquakes\nalong BTF since 1976.

Existing LLM-based graph analysis\napproaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine\nlearning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs'\ninternal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address\nthese limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents,\nwhich have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for\nproblem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy\nand collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named\nGraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from\nthree modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with\neach other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output\nnormalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key\narguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding,\nand the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2)\nexternal knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting\nof relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent\nretrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving\nmodule: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent\nuses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case\nthe coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the\nresults without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.\nThe code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.",

To study the\nfunctioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional\norganisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different\nlevels of detail and abstraction.\n  We address these challenges by introducing a category-theoretic formalism for\nbiochemical processes visualised using SBGN Process Description (SBGN-PD)\nlanguage. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric\nmonoidal double category and demonstrate its horizontal 1-morphisms as SBGN\nProcess Descriptions. We obtain organisational principles such as\n'compositionality' (building a large SBGN-PD from smaller ones) and\n'zooming-out' (abstracting away details in biochemical processes) defined in\ncategory-theoretic terms. We also formally investigate how a particular portion\nof a biochemical network influences the remaining portion of the network and\nvice versa. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings using standard\nSBGN-PD examples.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the thermoelectric performance of minimally nonlinear\nirreversible heat engines with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS), realized\nthrough voltage and voltage-temperature probe configurations. Our framework\nextends the Onsager relations by incorporating a nonlinear power dissipation\nterm into the heat current. We derive and analyze analytical expressions for\nthe efficiency at a given power and the efficiency at maximum power (EMP),\nexpressed in terms of asymmetry parameters and generalized figures of merit.\nOur analysis reveals that the combined effects of broken TRS and nonlinear\ndissipation give rise to two universal bounds on the EMP that can surpass the\nCurzon-Ahlborn (CA) limit. Although these bounds share a similar analytical\nform, differences in Carnot efficiency and asymmetry parameters lead to\ndistinct operational characteristics, as shown through numerical simulations.\nWe consider a triple-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm heat engine incorporating either\na voltage probe or a voltage-temperature probe. In both cases, TRS is broken by\nthe magnetic flux. However, the voltage-temperature probe requires an\nadditional anisotropy in the system for its TRS-breaking effects to\nsignificantly influence transport. We examine the role of this anisotropy in\nenhancing performance. Our results show that the EMP and efficiency at a given\npower can be enhanced by increasing the strength of nonlinear power\ndissipation, even though the output power remains unchanged. The voltage probe\nconfiguration generally yields higher power, while the voltage-temperature\nprobe is more efficient, except in certain regimes where large asymmetries and\nhigh figures of merit allow the voltage probe setup to outperform.",

    "abstract": "For particles decaying without parity violation, it is impossible to\nreconstruct the full spin-density matrix from the velocities of their decay\nproducts. In this work, we consider Bell inequalities based on squares of spin\noperators. The corresponding Bell operators probe only the part of the density\nmatrix that can be reconstructed from any gauge boson decay or splitting to\nfermions, which is accessible regardless of whether parity is violated. We find\nthat our new choice of Bell operator has promising properties regarding states\nseen at colliders. In particular, it substantially outperforms the inequality\npreviously used for the $pp \\rightarrow ZZ$ process at the LHC in terms of the\nphase space volume in which it is violated. We also conduct the first\ninvestigation of Bell violation in a system involving gauge bosons mediating\ndifferent interactions, namely the $W$ boson and gluon in the $pp \\rightarrow\nW^{\\pm} (g\\rightarrow b\\bar{b})$ process.",

We use a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the\nlogarithm of a conditional hazard function given covariates and obtain a DNN\nlikelihood-based estimator of the conditional hazard function. Such an\nestimation approach renders model flexibility and hence relaxes structural and\nfunctional assumptions on conditional hazard or survival functions. We\nestablish the nonasymptotic error bound and functional asymptotic normality of\nthe proposed estimator. Subsequently, we develop new one-sample tests for\ngoodness-of-fit evaluation and two-sample tests for treatment comparison. Both\nsimulation studies and real application analysis show superior performances of\nthe proposed estimators and tests in comparison with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Many biological processes occur on time scales longer than those accessible\nto molecular dynamics simulations. Identifying collective variables (CVs) and\nintroducing an external potential to accelerate them is a popular approach to\naddress this problem. In particular, $\\texttt{PLUMED}$ is a community-developed\nlibrary that implements several methods for CV-based enhanced sampling. This\nchapter discusses two recent developments that have gained popularity in recent\nyears. The first is the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method\nas a biasing scheme. This provides a unified approach to enhanced sampling able\nto cover many different scenarios: from free energy convergence to the\ndiscovery of metastable states, from rate calculation to generalized ensemble\nsimulation. The second development concerns the use of machine learning (ML)\napproaches to determine CVs by learning the relevant variables directly from\nsimulation data. The construction of these variables is facilitated by the\n$\\texttt{mlcolvar}$ library, which allows them to be optimized in Python and\nthen used to enhance sampling thanks to a native interface inside\n$\\texttt{PLUMED}$. For each of these methods, in addition to a brief\nintroduction, we provide guidelines, practical suggestions and point to\nexamples from the literature to facilitate their use in the study of the\nprocess of interest.",

Unfortunately, successful\napplication of DPO to T2I models requires a huge amount of resources to collect\nand label large-scale datasets, e.g., millions of generated paired images\nannotated with human preferences. In addition, these human preference datasets\ncan get outdated quickly as the rapid improvements of T2I models lead to higher\nquality images. In this work, we investigate a scalable approach for collecting\nlarge-scale and fully synthetic datasets for DPO training. Specifically, the\npreferences for paired images are generated using a pre-trained reward\nfunction, eliminating the need for involving humans in the annotation process,\ngreatly improving the dataset collection efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat such datasets allow averaging predictions across multiple models and\ncollecting ranked preferences as opposed to pairwise preferences. Furthermore,\nwe introduce RankDPO to enhance DPO-based methods using the ranking feedback.\nApplying RankDPO on SDXL and SD3-Medium models with our synthetically generated\npreference dataset \"Syn-Pic\" improves both prompt-following (on benchmarks like\nT2I-Compbench, GenEval, and DPG-Bench) and visual quality (through user\nstudies).

    "abstract": "With the development of intelligent connected vehicle technology,\nhuman-machine shared control has gained popularity in vehicle following due to\nits effectiveness in driver assistance. However, traditional vehicle following\nsystems struggle to maintain stability when driver reaction time fluctuates, as\nthese variations require different levels of system intervention. To address\nthis issue, the proposed human-machine shared vehicle following assistance\nsystem (HM-VFAS) integrates driver outputs under various states with the\nassistance system. The system employs an intelligent driver model that accounts\nfor reaction time delays, simulating time-varying driver outputs. A control\nauthority allocation strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the level of\nintervention based on real-time driver state assessment. To handle instability\nfrom driver authority switching, the proposed solution includes a two-layer\nadaptive finite time sliding mode controller (A-FTSMC). The first layer is an\nintegral sliding mode adaptive controller that ensures robustness by\ncompensating for uncertainties in the driver output. The second layer is a fast\nnon-singular terminal sliding mode controller designed to accelerate\nconvergence for rapid stabilization. Using real driver videos as inputs, the\nperformance of the HM-VFAS was evaluated. Results show that the proposed\ncontrol strategy maintains a safe distance under time-varying driver states,\nwith the actual acceleration error relative to the target acceleration\nmaintained within 0.5m/s~2 and the maximum acceleration error reduced by\n1.2m/s~2.

    "abstract": "Fatigue fracture is one of the main causes of failure in structures. However,\nthe simulation of fatigue crack growth is computationally demanding due to the\nlarge number of load cycles involved. Metals in the low cycle fatigue range\noften show significant plastic zones at the crack tip, calling for\nelastic-plastic material models, which increase the computation time even\nfurther. In pursuit of a more efficient model, we propose a simplified\nphase-field model for ductile fatigue fracture, which indirectly accounts for\nplasticity within the fatigue damage accumulation. Additionally, a\ncycle-skipping approach is inherent to the concept, reducing computation time\nby up to several orders of magnitude.\n  Essentially, the proposed model is a simplification of a phase-field model\nwith elastic-plastic material behavior. As a reference, we therefore implement\na conventional elastic-plastic phase-field fatigue model with nonlinear\nhardening and a fatigue variable based on the strain energy density, and\ncompare the simplified model to it. Its approximation of the stress-strain\nbehavior, the neglect of the plastic crack driving force and consequential\nrange of applicability are discussed.\n  Since in fact the novel efficient model is similar in its structure to a\nphase-field fatigue model we published in the past, we include this older\nversion in the comparison, too. Compared to this model variant, the novel model\nimproves the approximation of the plastic strains and corresponding stresses\nand refines the damage computation based on the Local Strain Approach. For all\nmodel variants, experimentally determined values for elastic, plastic, fracture\nand fatigue properties of AA2024 T351 aluminum sheet material are employed.",

This property is particularly useful for comparing datasets\nthat naturally admit isomorphic representations, such as unlabelled graphs or\nobjects embedded in space. However, apart from the recently derived empirical\nconvergence rates for the quadratic GW problem, a statistical theory for valid\nestimation and inference remains largely obscure. Pushing the frontier of\nstatistical GW further, this work derives the first limit laws for the\nempirical GW distance across several settings of interest: (i)~discrete,\n(ii)~semi-discrete, and (iii)~general distributions under moment constraints\nunder the entropically regularized GW distance. The derivations rely on a novel\nstability analysis of the GW functional in the marginal distributions. The\nlimit laws then follow by an adaptation of the functional delta method. As\nasymptotic normality fails to hold in most cases, we establish the consistency\nof an efficient estimation procedure for the limiting law in the discrete case,\nbypassing the need for computationally intensive resampling methods. We apply\nthese findings to testing whether collections of unlabelled graphs are\ngenerated from distributions that are isomorphic to each other.",

Initially proposed for\ncollinear magnets, the concept has since been extended to include certain\nnon-collinear structures. A recent development in Landau theory for collinear\naltermagnets incorporates spin-space symmetries, providing a robust framework\nfor identifying this class of materials. Here we expand on that theory to\nidentify altermagnetic multipolar order parameters in non-collinear chiral\nmaterials. We demonstrate that the interplay between non-collinear\naltermagnetism and chirality allows for spatially odd multipole components,\nleading to non-trivial spin textures on Fermi surfaces and unexpected transport\nphenomena, even in the absence of SOC. This makes such chiral altermagnets\nfundamentally different from the well-known SOC-driven Rashba-Edelstein and\nspin Hall effects used for 2D spintronics. Choosing the chiral topological\nmagnetic material Mn$_3$IrSi as a case study, we apply toy models and\nfirst-principles calculations to predict experimental signatures, such as large\nspin-Hall and Edelstein effects, that have not been previously observed in\naltermagnets. These findings pave the way for a new realm of spintronics\napplications based on spin-transport properties of chiral altermagnets.",

In this study, we report a novel finding in the\nchemiresistive behavior of magnetite (Fe3O4), where its response has been found\nto be modulated in an anisotropic manner when exposed to an external magnetic\nfield, analogous to Earth's magnetic field. Remarkably, substantial variations\nhave been observed in response to analytes naturally present in the atmosphere.\nThis chemiresistive response exhibits a strong anisotropic dependence on the\nstrength, direction and inclination of the magnetic field, suggesting that\nmagnetite's electrical resistance dynamically adapts to both magnetic and\nchemical environmental changes. The observed behavior under Earth-like magnetic\nfield closely mirrors the magnetoreception seen in migratory species that rely\non magnetite for navigation.

In this \"proof of concept\" paper we posit\nthe superiority of neural network models over statistical models for predicting\nmusical events. Specifically, we compare LSTM, Transformer, and GPT models\nagainst a widely-used markov model to predict a chord event following a\nsequence of chords.\n  Utilizing chord sequences from the McGill Billboard dataset, we trained each\nmodel to predict the next chord from a given sequence of chords.

A key challenge is the\nlack of generalized methods for segmenting RGB-D data into semantically\nmeaningful components while maintaining accurate geometric representations. We\nintroduce a novel end-to-end modular pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art\nsemantic segmentation, human tracking, point-cloud fusion, and scene\nreconstruction. Our approach improves semantic segmentation accuracy by\nleveraging the foundational segmentation model SAM2 with a hybrid method that\ncombines its mask generation with a semantic classification model, resulting in\nsharper masks and high classification accuracy. Compared to SegFormer and\nOneFormer, our method achieves a similar semantic segmentation accuracy (mIoU\nof 47.0% vs 45.9% in the ADE20K dataset) but provides much more precise object\nboundaries. Additionally, our human tracking algorithm interacts with the\nsegmentation enabling continuous tracking even when objects leave and re-enter\nthe frame by object re-identification. Our point cloud fusion approach reduces\ncomputation time by 1.81x while maintaining a small mean reconstruction error\nof 25.3 mm by leveraging the semantic information. We validate our approach on\nbenchmark datasets and real-world Kinect RGB-D data, demonstrating improved\nefficiency, accuracy, and usability.

Among its variants,\nVertical Federated Learning (VFL) is particularly relevant in real-world,\ncross-organizational collaborations, where distinct features of a shared\ninstance group are contributed by different parties. In these scenarios,\nparties are often linked using fuzzy identifiers, leading to a common practice\ntermed as multi-party fuzzy VFL. Existing models generally address either\nmulti-party VFL or fuzzy VFL between two parties. Extending these models to\npractical multi-party fuzzy VFL typically results in significant performance\ndegradation and increased costs for maintaining privacy. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce the Federated Transformer (FeT), a novel framework\nthat supports multi-party VFL with fuzzy identifiers. FeT innovatively encodes\nthese identifiers into data representations and employs a transformer\narchitecture distributed across different parties, incorporating three new\ntechniques to enhance performance. Furthermore, we have developed a multi-party\nprivacy framework for VFL that integrates differential privacy with secure\nmulti-party computation, effectively protecting local representations while\nminimizing associated utility costs. Our experiments demonstrate that the FeT\nsurpasses the baseline models by up to 46\\% in terms of accuracy when scaled to\n50 parties.

A strong correlation is found between the iron-to-silicate mass fraction\nof protoplanetary disks and planets, while no significant correlation was\nobserved for water mass fractions.

    "abstract": "The self-attention mechanism traditionally relies on the softmax operator,\nnecessitating positional embeddings like RoPE, or position biases to account\nfor token order. But current methods using still face length generalisation\nchallenges. We investigate an alternative attention mechanism based on the\nstick-breaking process in larger scale settings. The method works as follows:\nFor each token before the current, we determine a break point, which represents\nthe proportion of the stick, the weight of the attention, to allocate to the\ncurrent token. We repeat this on the remaining stick, until all tokens are\nallocated a weight, resulting in a sequence of attention weights. This process\nnaturally incorporates recency bias, which has linguistic motivations for\ngrammar parsing. We study the implications of replacing the conventional\nsoftmax-based attention mechanism with stick-breaking attention. We then\ndiscuss implementation of numerically stable stick-breaking attention and adapt\nFlash Attention to accommodate this mechanism. When used as a drop-in\nreplacement for current softmax+RoPE attention systems, we find that\nstick-breaking attention performs competitively with current methods on length\ngeneralisation and downstream tasks. Stick-breaking also performs well at\nlength generalisation, allowing a model trained with $2^{11}$ context window to\nperform well at $2^{14}$ with perplexity improvements.",

Recent machine learning\n(ML) models can harness vast datasets for accurate predictions at large spatial\nscales. However, there are open questions regarding model design and data\nneeded for inputs and training to improve performance. This study explores\nthese questions while demonstrating the ability of deep learning models to make\naccurate stream temperature predictions in unmonitored basins across the\nconterminous United States. First, we compare top-down models that utilize data\nfrom a large number of basins with bottom-up methods that transfer ML models\nbuilt on local sites, reflecting traditional regionalization techniques. We\nalso evaluate an intermediary grouped modeling approach that categorizes sites\nbased on regional co-location or similarity of catchment characteristics.\nSecond, we evaluate trade-offs between model complexity, prediction accuracy,\nand applicability for more target locations by systematically removing inputs.\nWe then examine model performance when additional training data becomes\navailable due to reductions in input requirements. Our results suggest that\ntop-down models significantly outperform bottom-up and grouped models.\nMoreover, it is possible to get acceptable accuracy by reducing both dynamic\nand static inputs enabling predictions for more sites with lower model\ncomplexity and computational needs. From detailed error analysis, we determined\nthat the models are more accurate for sites primarily controlled by air\ntemperatures compared to locations impacted by groundwater and dams. By\naddressing these questions, this research offers a comprehensive perspective on\noptimizing ML model design for accurate predictions in unmonitored regions.",

However, with the recent growth in the number of mobile\ndevices, the wireless spectrum is becoming scarce, resulting in low spectral\nefficiency for D2D communications. To address this problem, this paper aims to\nintegrate the ambient backscatter communication technology into D2D devices to\nallow them to backscatter ambient RF signals to transmit their data when the\nshared spectrum is occupied by mobile users. To obtain the optimal spectrum\naccess policy, i.e., stay idle or access the shared spectrum and perform active\ntransmissions or backscattering ambient RF signals for transmissions, to\nmaximize the average throughput for D2D users, deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) can be adopted. However, DRL-based solutions may require long training\ntime due to the curse of dimensionality issue as well as complex deep neural\nnetwork architectures. For that, we develop a novel quantum reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm that can achieve a faster convergence rate with fewer\ntraining parameters compared to DRL thanks to the quantum superposition and\nquantum entanglement principles. Specifically, instead of using conventional\ndeep neural networks, the proposed quantum RL algorithm uses a parametrized\nquantum circuit to approximate an optimal policy. Extensive simulations then\ndemonstrate that the proposed solution not only can significantly improve the\naverage throughput of D2D devices when the shared spectrum is busy but also can\nachieve much better performance in terms of convergence rate and learning\ncomplexity compared to existing DRL-based methods.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a superior alternative to\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) for high-fidelity image generation, with\nwide applications in text-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, and\nsuper-resolution. However, their real-time feasibility is hindered by slow\ntraining and inference speeds. This study addresses this challenge by proposing\na wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image\nSuper-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to\nreduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete\nWavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing\ntraining and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental\nvalidation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed\nscheme. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methodologies\nsuccessfully ensuring high-fidelity output while overcoming inherent drawbacks\nassociated with diffusion models in time-sensitive applications.",

We emphasize\nthat dark photon production occurs successfully when the dark Higgs field\nremains in the symmetric phase due to non-thermal trapping effects. For\nrenormalizable Higgs potentials, our bound reads $$\\frac{m_{\\gamma'}}{q_H\ne_H}\\;\\gg \\;60\\,{\\rm eV}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^{1/4}$$ where\n$m_{\\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, $q_H$ is\nthe charge of the dark Higgs boson, and $\\lambda$ is the Higgs quartic\ncoupling}. This constraint holds independently of any complications arising\nfrom the Schwinger effect and vortex formation in the Higgsed phase. For more\ngeneral Higgs potentials such as the Coleman-Weinberg type potential, our bound\nyields different forms. We argue that late-time symmetry breaking of the dark\nU(1) symmetry satisfying our bound has only a mild impact on both the abundance\nand momentum distribution of dark photon dark matter, and therefore does not\npose any serious problem for the dark photon dark matter scenario.",

In addition, we present an adaptive version of our method that\nautomatically selects the appropriate noise magnitude during sampling, striking\na good balance between exploration efficiency and approximation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the variability of seasonal snow cover, in particular snow depth\nin remote areas, poses significant challenges due to limited spatial and\ntemporal data availability. This study uses snow depth measurements from the\nICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which are sparse in both space and time,\nand incorporates them with climate reanalysis data into a\ndownscaling-calibration scheme to produce monthly gridded snow depth maps at\nmicroscale (10 m). Snow surface elevation measurements from ICESat-2 along\nprofiles are compared to a digital elevation model to determine snow depth at\neach point. To efficiently turn sparse measurements into snow depth maps, a\nregression model is fitted to establish a relationship between the retrieved\nsnow depth and the corresponding ERA5 Land snow depth. This relationship,\nreferred to as subgrid variability, is then applied to downscale the monthly\nERA5 Land snow depth data. The method can provide timeseries of monthly snow\ndepth maps for the entire ERA5 time range (since 1950). The validation of\ndownscaled snow depth data was performed at an intermediate scale (100 m x 500\nm) using datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in the Hardangervidda\nregion of southern Norway. Results show that snow depth prediction achieved R2\nvalues ranging from 0.74 to 0.88 (post-calibration). The method relies on\nglobally available data and is applicable to other snow regions above the\ntreeline. Though requiring area-specific calibration, our approach has the\npotential to provide snow depth maps in areas where no such data exist and can\nbe used to extrapolate existing snow surveys in time and over larger areas.\nWith this, it can offer valuable input data for hydrological, ecological or\npermafrost modeling tasks.",

Unfortunately, these directions require\neither a large number of small Gaussians or expensive per-pixel post-processing\nfor reconstructing fine details, which negatively impacts rendering\nperformance. To meet the high performance demands of virtual reality (VR)\nsystems, primitive or pixel counts therefore must be kept low, affecting visual\nquality.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on foveated rendering\nas a promising solution that combines the strengths of both point rendering\ndirections regarding performance sweet spots. Analyzing the compatibility with\nthe human visual system, we find that using a low-detailed, few primitive\nsmooth Gaussian representation for the periphery is cheap to compute and meets\nthe perceptual demands of peripheral vision. For the fovea only, we use neural\npoints with a convolutional neural network for the small pixel footprint, which\nprovides sharp, detailed output within the rendering budget. This combination\nalso allows for synergistic method accelerations with point occlusion culling\nand reducing the demands on the neural network.\n  Our evaluation confirms that our approach increases sharpness and details\ncompared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration, and participants of a user\nstudy overwhelmingly preferred our method.

Among various memory technologies, ReRAM crossbars show promising\nperformance in computing dot-product operations in the analog domain.\nNevertheless, the expensive writing procedure of ReRAM cells has led\nresearchers to design accelerators whose crossbars have enough capacity to\nstore the full DNN. Given the tremendous and continuous increase in DNN model\nsizes, this approach is unfeasible for some networks, or inefficient due to the\nhuge hardware requirements. Those accelerators lack the flexibility to adapt to\nany given DNN model, facing an challenge.\n  To address this issue we introduce ARAS, a cost-effective ReRAM-based\naccelerator that employs a smart scheduler to adapt different DNNs to the\nresource-limited hardware. ARAS also overlaps the computation of a layer with\nthe weight writing of several layers to mitigate the high writing latency of\nReRAM. Furthermore, ARAS introduces three optimizations aimed at reducing the\nenergy overheads of writing in ReRAM. Our key optimization capitalizes on the\nobservation that DNN weights can be re-encoded to augment their similarity\nbetween layers, increasing the amount of bitwise values that are equal or\nsimilar when overwriting ReRAM cells and, hence, reducing the amount of energy\nrequired to update the cells. Overall, ARAS greatly reduces the ReRAM writing\nactivity. We evaluate ARAS on a popular set of DNNs. ARAS provides up to 2.2x\nspeedup and 45% energy savings over a baseline PUM accelerator without any\noptimization. Compared to a TPU-like accelerator, ARAS provides up to 1.5x\nspeedup and 61% energy savings.",

Despite\nthis simple training objective, they have proved to be powerful AI tools.\nHowever, only predicting the next token results in top layer embedding vectors\nthat are highly token-focused. There may be benefits in generating embedding\nvectors at each token position that better capture the overall meaning of\nlonger sequences of future text. Recent studies matching brain scans with deep\nlanguage models suggest that humans also predict upcoming words when listening\nor reading but consider multiple future tokens rather than just one.\n  This research investigates a new pretraining method called Future Token\nPrediction (FTP). In FTP, a large transformer encoder generates top layer\nembedding vectors for each token position, which, instead of being passed to a\nlanguage head, are linearly and expansively projected to a pseudo-sequence,\nwhich is cross attended to by a small transformer decoder to predict the next N\ntokens forward from that position in the sequence.\n  The top layer embedding vectors from FTP models exhibit distinct properties\ncompared to those from standard GPT models, varying smoothly along a text\nsequence as measured by cosine similarity between adjacent tokens. Text\ngenerated by FTP models show improved topic coherence compared to standard\nGPT-like models trained with the same prediction perplexity for the next single\ntoken.

    "abstract": "Heap-based exploits that leverage memory management errors continue to pose a\nsignificant threat to application security. The root cause of these\nvulnerabilities are the memory management errors within the applications,\nhowever various hardened allocator designs have been proposed as mitigation. A\ncommon feature of these designs is the strategic decision to store heap\nmetadata separately from the application data in use, thereby reducing the risk\nof metadata corruption leading to security breaches. Despite their potential\nbenefits, hardened allocators have not been widely adopted in real-world\napplications. The primary barrier to their adoption is the performance\noverheads they introduce. These overheads can negatively impact the efficiency\nand speed of applications, which is a critical consideration for developers and\nsystem administrators. Having learned from previous implementations, we\ndeveloped SJMalloc, a general-purpose, high-performance allocator that\naddresses these concerns. SJMalloc stores its metadata out-of-band, away from\nthe application's data on the heap. This design choice not only enhances\nsecurity but also improves performance. Across a variety of real-world\nworkloads, SJMalloc demonstrates a ~6% performance improvement compared to\nGLibcs allocator, while using only ~5% more memory.

We find accretion to be suppressed\nin the most massive black holes below $z\\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the\nanti-hierarchical growth hypothesis.

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent observations of rapid (interannual) signals in the\ngeomagnetic data, and by advances in numerical simulations approaching the\nEarth's outer core conditions, we present a study on the dynamics of\nhydromagnetic waves evolving over a static base state. Under the assumption of\ntimescales separation between the rapid waves and the slow convection, we\nlinearise the classical magneto-hydrodynamics equations over a steady\nnon-axisymmetric background magnetic field and a zero velocity field. The\ninitial perturbation is a super-rotating pulse of the inner core, which sets\nthe amplitude and length-scales of the waves in the system. The initial pulse\ntriggers axisymmetric, outward propagating torsional Alfv\\'en waves, with\ncharacteristic thickness scaling with the magnetic Ekman number as\n$Ek_M^{1/4}$. Because the background state is non-axisymmetric, the pulse also\ntriggers non-axisymmetric, quasi-geostrophic Alfv\\'en waves. As these latter\nwaves propagate outwards, they turn into quasi-geostrophic, magneto-Coriolis\nwaves (QG-MC) as the Coriolis force supersedes inertia in the force balance.\nThe period of the initial wave packet is preserved across the shell but the\nQG-MC wave front disperses and a westward drift is observed after this\ntransformation. Upon reaching the core surface, the westward drift of the QG-MC\nwaves presents an estimated phase speed of about $1100\\,km/y$. This analysis\nconfirms the QG-MC nature of the rapid magnetic signals observed in geomagnetic\nfield models near the equator.",

When high resolution\ndata become available, it is natural to seek model correction to improve the\nresolution of the model predictions.

In this paper, we address these challenges with a\nmodel-correction method which only requires a scarce high-fidelity data set.\nOur method first seeks a deep neural network (DNN) model to approximate the\nexisting low-fidelity model. By using the scarce high-fidelity data, the method\nthen corrects the DNN model via transfer learning (TL). After TL, an improved\nDNN model with high prediction accuracy to the underlying dynamics is obtained.\nOne distinct feature of the propose method is that it does not assume a\nspecific form of the model correction terms.

Their analysis\nclarified how ART requires a quadratic number of distance computations as the\nnumber of test executions increases, which limits its scalability in scenarios\nrequiring extensive testing to uncover faults. Simulation results support this,\nshowing that the computational overhead of these distance calculations often\noutweighs ART's benefits. While various ART variants have attempted to reduce\nthese costs, they frequently do so at the expense of fault detection, lack\ncomplexity guarantees, or are restricted to specific input types, such as\nnumerical or discrete data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for\nadaptive random testing that replaces pairwise distance computations with a\ncompact aggregation of past executions, such as counting the q-grams observed\nin previous runs. Test case selection then leverages this aggregated data to\nmeasure diversity (e.g., entropy of q-grams), allowing us to reduce the\ncomputational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments with a benchmark\nof six web applications, show that ART with q-grams covers, on average, 4x more\nunique targets than random testing, and 3.5x more than ART using traditional\ndistance-based methods.",

Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for\ntraditional analysis methods.

In response to this challenge, we developed a novel\napproach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental\nmode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical\nG-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly\nadvanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity\nfrom time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive\nperformance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance\nof 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE)\nis 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These\nresults showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating\nmetallicity values.

On the statistical side, our main negative result shows that most\nwell-studied settings for reinforcement learning with function approximation\nbecome intractable when composed with rich observations; we complement this\nwith a positive result, identifying latent pushforward coverability as a\ngeneral condition that enables statistical tractability. Algorithmically, we\ndevelop provably efficient observable-to-latent reductions -- that is,\nreductions that transform an arbitrary algorithm for the latent MDP into an\nalgorithm that can operate on rich observations -- in two settings: one where\nthe agent has access to hindsight observations of the latent dynamics [LADZ23],\nand one where the agent can estimate self-predictive latent models [SAGHCB20].\nTogether, our results serve as a first step toward a unified statistical and\nalgorithmic theory for reinforcement learning under latent dynamics.",

Various techniques have been\ndeveloped to tackle these challenges, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which\ninvolves introducing a parallel trainable low-rank matrix to the fixed\npre-trained weights at each layer. However, these methods often fall short\ncompared to the full-rank weight training approach, as they restrict the\nparameter search to a low-rank subspace. This limitation can disrupt training\ndynamics and require a full-rank warm start to mitigate the impact. In this\npaper, we introduce a new method inspired by a phenomenon we formally prove: as\ntraining progresses, the rank of the estimated layer gradients gradually\ndecreases, and asymptotically approaches rank one.

    "abstract": "Residential location choices are traditionally modelled using factors related\nto accessibility and socioeconomic environments, neglecting the importance of\nlocal street-level conditions. Arguably, this neglect is due to data practices.\nToday, however, street-level images -- which are highly effective at encoding\nstreet-level conditions -- are widely available. Additionally, recent advances\nin discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities offer\nopportunities to integrate street-level conditions into residential location\nchoice analysis. This study leverages these developments to investigate the\nspatial distribution of utility derived from street-level conditions in\nresidential location choices on a city-wide scale. In our case study of\nRotterdam, the Netherlands, we find that the utility derived from street-level\nconditions varies significantly on a highly localised scale, with conditions\nrapidly changing even within neighbourhoods. Our results also reveal that the\nhigh real-estate prices in the city centre cannot be attributed to attractive\nstreet-level conditions. Furthermore, whereas the city centre is characterised\nby relatively unattractive residential street-level conditions, neighbourhoods\nin the southern part of the city -- often perceived as problematic -- exhibit\nsurprisingly appealing street-level environments. The methodological\ncontribution of this paper is that it advances the discrete choice models\nincorporating computer vision capabilities by introducing a semantic\nregularisation layer to the model. Thereby, it adds explainability and\neliminates the need for a separate pipeline to extract information from images,\nstreamlining the analysis.

To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at\na granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most\ncritical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a\nbinary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an\nindicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite\nsubstantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model\nidentified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\\% overlap, highlighting fundamental\npatterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing\nnon-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively\ntuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency\nwith minimal performance loss.

By going beyond the mean-field\napproximation and incorporating screening effects via ring diagrams, we explore\nthe chiral symmetry restoration in extreme conditions, such as high\ntemperatures, high densities, and large angular velocities. Our analysis\nreveals how the critical temperature decreases as the angular velocity\nincreases, suggesting that vorticity catalyzes the symmetry restoration.\nAdditionally, we observe a shift in the Critical End Point (CEP) in the\neffective QCD phase diagram, where higher angular velocities move the CEP to\nlower quark chemical potentials and higher temperatures. Moreover, we analyze\nthe baryon number fluctuations through the normalized fourth moment $\\kappa\n\\sigma^2 = c_4/c_2$ as a function of the collision energy in heavy-ion\nreactions $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, which serves as a key observable to identify the\nCEP. Our study reveals that for high collision energies, $\\kappa \\sigma^2$\nremains nearly constant; however, as the system approaches the CEP, the ratio\nincreases sharply, indicating the proximity of the critical region. This rise\nis influenced by the presence of vorticity, which causes the CEP to shift to\nhigher collision energies.

We study the\neffect of various passenger movement variables on the boarding process. We\nevaluate the impact of these factors on the boarding time when the boarding\nprocess runs sequentially and in parallel with the aisles of the Flying Wing\nlayout. Then, we analyze the impact of an increase in the number of aisles on\nthe relative speed of all boarding methods and conclude that methods utilizing\nboarding of the separate aisles simultaneously (parallel boarding) converge to\nthe fastest boarding time given by the Steffen method. With parallel boarding\nof the aisles the relative advantage of the Steffen method compared to\nWindows-Middle-Aisle (WMA) or Back-to-front boarding decreases, from being\n1.6-2.1 times as fast to being approximately equal for our fiducial Flying Wing\nseating arrangement. Standard methods such as Back-to-front or WMA are about\ntwice as fast to board a four-aisle Flying Wing plane, compared to a\nsingle-aisle aircraft with the same number of passengers. We also investigate\nthe difference between the optimal approach to parallel boarding, where\nconsecutive passengers always enter separate aisles, and a less optimal but\nmore practical approach. The practical approach is only up to 1.06 times slower\nthan the optimal, meaning that the advantages of parallel boarding can be\nutilized without resorting to impractical boarding methods. Hence, the\nintroduction of multiple aisles into aircraft seating design offers the\nprospect of significantly decreasing the boarding time for passengers, without\nthe introduction of inconvenient boarding methods.",

Here, we provide\nnew insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational\ndesign of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl\nglycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational\nmodes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time\nthe molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the\nuse high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with\nquasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive\nmicroscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the\nmolecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in\ncalorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular\nrotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen\nbonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main\nreorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve\nan outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change.\nThese results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the\nthermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials.

    "abstract": "The most massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are known to form through\nnumerous galaxy mergers. Thus, it is intriguing to study whether their\nformation in low-density environments, where nearby companions are almost\nabsent, is associated with mergers, which are directly traced by tidal\nfeatures. Using the 436 most massive ETGs with\n$M_\\mathrm{star}>10^{11.2}\\,M_{\\odot}$ at $z<0.04$, we determine the variation\nin the fraction of massive ETGs with tidal features ($f_T$) across different\nenvironments and verify whether the most massive ETGs commonly have tidal\nfeatures in very low density environments. Our main discovery is that the most\nmassive ETGs exhibit tidal features more frequently in lower-density\nenvironments. In the highest-density environments, like galaxy clusters, $f_T$\nis $0.21\\pm0.06$, while in the lowest-density environments it triples to\n$0.62\\pm0.06$. This trend is stronger for more extremely massive ETGs, with\n$f_T$ reaching $0.92\\pm0.08$ in the lowest-density environments. One\nexplanation for our finding is that the most massive ETGs in lower-density\nenvironments have genuinely experienced recent mergers more frequently than\ntheir counterparts in higher-density environments, suggesting that they possess\nextended formation histories that continue into the present. Another\npossibility is that tidal features last shorter in denser environments owing to\nexternal factors inherent in these environments. Our additional findings that\nmassive ETGs with bluer $u-r$ colors are a more dominant driver of our main\ndiscovery and that dust lanes are more commonly observed in massive ETGs in\nlow-density environments imply that gas-abundant mergers primarily contribute\nto the increased rate of recent mergers in low-density environments.",

To\nsurmount this hurdle, we introduce TAGE, an innovative image generation network\ncomprising three integral modules: the Codebook Learning Module (CLM), the Code\nPrediction Module (CPM) and the Prompt-driven Semantic Module (PSM). The CPM\nmodule delves into the semantic dimensions of category-agnostic attributes,\nencapsulating them within a discrete codebook. This module is predicated on the\nconcept that images are assemblages of attributes, and thus, by editing these\ncategory-independent attributes, it is theoretically possible to generate\nimages from unseen categories. Subsequently, the CPM module facilitates\nnaturalistic image editing by predicting indices of category-independent\nattribute vectors within the codebook. Additionally, the PSM module generates\nsemantic cues that are seamlessly integrated into the Transformer architecture\nof the CPM, enhancing the model's comprehension of the targeted attributes for\nediting. With these semantic cues, the model can generate images that\naccentuate desired attributes more prominently while maintaining the integrity\nof the original category, even with a limited number of samples. We have\nconducted extensive experiments utilizing the Animal Faces, Flowers, and\nVGGFaces datasets. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed method not only achieves superior performance but also exhibits a high\ndegree of stability when compared to other few-shot image generation\ntechniques.",

Although various adaptations of TMs have expanded their\napplicability across diverse domains, a fundamental gap remains in\nunderstanding how TMs quantify uncertainty in their predictions. In response,\nthis paper introduces the Probabilistic Tsetlin Machine (PTM) framework, aimed\nat providing a robust, reliable, and interpretable approach for uncertainty\nquantification. Unlike the original TM, the PTM learns the probability of\nstaying on each state of each Tsetlin Automaton (TA) across all clauses. These\nprobabilities are updated using the feedback tables that are part of the TM\nframework: Type I and Type II feedback. During inference, TAs decide their\nactions by sampling states based on learned probability distributions, akin to\nBayesian neural networks when generating weight values. In our experimental\nanalysis, we first illustrate the spread of the probabilities across TA states\nfor the noisy-XOR dataset. Then we evaluate the PTM alongside benchmark models\nusing both simulated and real-world datasets. The experiments on the simulated\ndataset reveal the PTM's effectiveness in uncertainty quantification,\nparticularly in delineating decision boundaries and identifying regions of high\nuncertainty. Moreover, when applied to multiclass classification tasks using\nthe Iris dataset, the PTM demonstrates competitive performance in terms of\npredictive entropy and expected calibration error, showcasing its potential as\na reliable tool for uncertainty estimation. Our findings underscore the\nimportance of selecting appropriate models for accurate uncertainty\nquantification in predictive tasks, with the PTM offering a particularly\ninterpretable and effective solution.",

    "abstract": "Determining the underlying equations of motion and parameter values for\nvibrating structures is of great concern in science and engineering. This work\nintroduces a new data-driven approach called the energy-based dual-phase\ndynamics identification (EDDI) method for identifying the nonlinear dynamics of\nsingle-degree-of-freedom oscillators. The EDDI method leverages the energies of\nthe system to identify the governing dynamics through the forces acting on the\noscillator. The approach consists of two phases: a model-dissipative and\nmodel-stiffness identification. In the first phase, the fact that kinetic and\nmechanical energies are equivalent when the displacement is zero is leveraged\nto compute the energy dissipated and a corresponding model for the nonlinear\ndamping of the system. In the second phase, the energy dissipated is used to\ncompute the mechanical energy (ME), which is then used to obtain a reformulated\nLagrangian. The conservative forces acting on the oscillator are then computed\nby taking the derivative the Lagrangian, then a model for the nonlinear\nstiffness is identified by solving a system of linear equations. The resulting\ngoverning equations are identified by including both the nonlinear damping and\nstiffness terms. A key novelty of the EDDI method is that the only thing\nrequired to perform the identification is free-response measurements and the\nmass of the oscillator. No prior understanding of the dynamics of the system is\nnecessary to identify the underlying dynamics, such that the EDDI method is a\ntruly data-driven method. The method is demonstrated using simulated and\nmeasured responses of nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom systems with a variety\nof nonlinear mechanisms.",

In\nparticular, probabilistic models capture the stochasticity inherent to these\ncomplex relations. We compare different probabilistic machine learning methods\nto model the uncertainty in the halo-galaxy connection and efficiently generate\ngalaxy catalogs that faithfully resemble the reference sample by predicting\njoint distributions of central galaxy properties conditioned to their host halo\nfeatures. The analysis is based on the IllustrisTNG300 simulation. The methods\nmodel the distributions in different ways. We compare a multilayer perceptron\nthat predicts the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, a\nmultilayer perceptron classifier, and the method of normalizing flows. The\nclassifier predicts the parameters of a Categorical distribution, which are\ndefined in a high-dimensional parameter space through a Voronoi cell-based\nhierarchical scheme. We evaluate the model's performances under various sample\nselections based on halo properties. The three methods exhibit comparable\nresults, with normalizing flows showing the best performance in most scenarios.\nThe models reproduce the main features of galaxy properties distributions with\nhigh-fidelity and reproduce the results obtained with traditional,\ndeterministic, estimators.

This claim is mostly based on\npast calculations using vertex corrections within the crude local-density\napproximation. Here, we explore a wide variety of non-local vertex corrections\nin the polarizability and the self-energy, using first-order approximations or\ninfinite summations to all orders. In particular, we use vertices based on\nstatically screened interactions like in the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

Existing approaches for ground-based mobile systems primarily focus on\nsmall wheeled robots, which face minimal constraints with overhanging obstacles\nand cannot manage steps or stairs, making the problem effectively 2D. However,\nnavigation for legged robots (or even humans) has to consider an extra\ndimension. This paper proposes a tailored scene representation coupled with an\nadvanced trajectory optimisation algorithm to enable safe navigation. Our 3D\nnavigation approach is suitable for any ground-based mobile robot, whether\nwheeled or legged, as well as for human assistance. Given a 3D point cloud of\nthe scene and the segmentation of the ground and non-ground points, we\nformulate two Gaussian Process distance fields to ensure a collision-free path\nand maintain distance to the ground constraints. Our method adeptly handles\nuneven terrain, steps, and overhanging objects through an innovative use of a\nquadtree structure, constructing a multi-resolution map of the free space and\nits connectivity graph based on a 2D projection of the relevant scene.\nEvaluations with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that this\napproach provides safe and smooth paths, accommodating a wide range of\nground-based mobile systems.",

Due to the nonlinear behavior and the inevitable feedback of\nthe structure on the exciter, higher harmonics in the applied excitation are\ngenerated. This is undesired, because the acquired response may deviate\nsubstantially from that of the structure under purely sinusoidal excitation, in\nparticular if one of the higher harmonics engages into resonance. We present a\nnew approach to suppress those higher excitation harmonics and thus the\nunwanted exciter-structure interaction: Higher harmonics are added to the\nvoltage input to the shaker whose Fourier coefficients are adjusted via\nfeedback control until the excitation is purely sinusoidal. The stability of\nthis method is analyzed for a simplified model; the resulting closed-form\nexpressions are useful, among others, to select an appropriate exciter\nconfiguration, including the drive point. A practical procedure for the control\ndesign is suggested. The proposed method is validated in virtual and real\nexperiments of internally resonant structures, in the two common configurations\nof force excitation via a stinger and base excitation. Excellent performance is\nachieved already when using the same control gains for all harmonics,\nthroughout the tested range of amplitudes and frequencies, even in the strongly\nnonlinear regime. Compared to the iterative state of the art, it is found that\nthe proposed method is simpler to implement, enables faster testing and it is\neasy to achieve a lower harmonic distortion.",

First, DREB-Net addresses\nthe particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a\nBlurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase.\nSecond, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level\nAttention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features.\nHere, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention\nmodules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the\ninference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to\nreduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function,\na combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images.\nFinally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of\nfeature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation\nModule (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing\ncapability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively\nperform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing\nexcellent performance and broad application prospects.

    "abstract": "Even with the significant advances of AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-Multimer) and\nAlphaFold3 (AF3) in protein complex structure prediction, their accuracy is\nstill not comparable with monomer structure prediction. Efficient quality\nassessment (QA) or estimation of model accuracy (EMA) models that can evaluate\nthe quality of the predicted protein-complexes without knowing their native\nstructures, are of key importance for protein structure generation and model\nselection. In this paper, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to capture the\natomic-level topological information around residues and design a topological\ndeep learning-based QA method, TopoQA, to assess the accuracy of protein\ncomplex interfaces. We integrate PH from topological data analysis into graph\nneural networks (GNNs) to characterize complex higher-order structures that\nGNNs might overlook, enhancing the learning of the relationship between the\ntopological structure of complex interfaces and quality scores. Our TopoQA\nmodel is extensively validated based on the two most-widely used datasets,\nDBM55-AF2 and HAF2, along with our newly constructed ABAG-AF3 dataset to\nfacilitate comparisons with AF3. For all three datasets, TopoQA outperforms\nAF-Multimer-based AF2Rank and shows an advantage over AF3 in nearly half of the\ntargets. In particular, in the DBM55-AF2 dataset, a ranking loss of 73.6% lower\nthan AF-Multimer-based AF2Rank is obtained. Further, other than AF-Multimer and\nAF3, we have also extensively compared with nearly-all the state-of-the-art\nmodels (as far as we know), it has been found that our TopoQA can achieve the\nhighest Top 10 Hit-rate on the DBM55-AF2 dataset and the lowest ranking loss on\nthe HAF2 dataset. Ablation experiments show that our topological features\nsignificantly improve the model performance. At the same time, our method also\nprovides a new paradigm for protein structure representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in learning-based methods have markedly enhanced the\ncapabilities of image compression. However, these methods struggle with high\nbit-depth volumetric medical images, facing issues such as degraded\nperformance, increased memory demand, and reduced processing speed. To address\nthese challenges, this paper presents the Bit-Division based Lossless\nVolumetric Image Compression (BD-LVIC) framework, which is tailored for high\nbit-depth medical volume compression. The BD-LVIC framework skillfully divides\nthe high bit-depth volume into two lower bit-depth segments: the Most\nSignificant Bit-Volume (MSBV) and the Least Significant Bit-Volume (LSBV). The\nMSBV concentrates on the most significant bits of the volumetric medical image,\ncapturing vital structural details in a compact manner. This reduction in\ncomplexity greatly improves compression efficiency using traditional codecs.\nConversely, the LSBV deals with the least significant bits, which encapsulate\nintricate texture details. To compress this detailed information effectively,\nwe introduce an effective learning-based compression model equipped with a\nTransformer-Based Feature Alignment Module, which exploits both intra-slice and\ninter-slice redundancies to accurately align features. Subsequently, a Parallel\nAutoregressive Coding Module merges these features to precisely estimate the\nprobability distribution of the least significant bit-planes. Our extensive\ntesting demonstrates that the BD-LVIC framework not only sets new performance\nbenchmarks across various datasets but also maintains a competitive coding\nspeed, highlighting its significant potential and practical utility in the\nrealm of volumetric medical image compression.",

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel PGDiffSeg (Prior-Guided\nDiffusion Denoising Model with Parameter-Shared Attention) that applies\ndiffusion denoising methods to breast cancer medical image segmentation,\naccurately recovering the affected areas from Gaussian noise.

Our objective is to improve our knowledge of the properties of\nmassive stars and the Arches cluster through high angular resolution radio\ncontinuum studies. We observed the Arches cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array in the C- and X-bands throughout 2016, 2018, and 2022. We used the\nA-configuration to achieve the highest possible angular resolution and\ncross-matched the detected point sources with stars detected in the infrared,\nusing proper motion catalogues to ensure cluster membership. We report the most\nextensive radio point source catalogue of the cluster to date, with a total of\n25 radio detections. We also created the deepest radio images of the cluster so\nfar. Most of our stellar radio sources (12/18) show a positive spectral index,\nindicating that the dominant emission process is free-free thermal radiation,\nwhich probably originates from stellar winds. We found that radio variability\nis more frequent than what was inferred from previous observations, affecting\nup to 60% of the sources associated with bright stellar counterparts. We\npropose four of our detections (F6, F18, F19 and F26) as primary candidates for\ncolliding-wind binaries based on their consistent flat-to-negative spectral\nindex. We classify F7, F9, F12, F14, and F55 as secondary colliding wind binary\ncandidates based on their high flux and/or spectral index variability, and\nX-ray counterparts.

UDC discretizes a mesh in a regular grid and divides it into\nthe face and vertex parts, recovering both complex structures and fine details.\nAs a result, the one-to-one mapping between UDC and mesh resolves the ambiguity\nproblem. In addition, GenUDC adopts a two-stage, coarse-to-fine generative\nprocess for 3D mesh generation. It first generates the face part as a rough\nshape and then the vertex part to craft a detailed shape. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate the superiority of UDC as a mesh representation and the favorable\nperformance of GenUDC in mesh generation.

However, existing solutions cannot interpret raw signals\ndirectly if a reference genome is unknown due to a lack of accurate mechanisms\nto handle increased noise in pairwise raw signal comparison. Our goal is to\nenable the direct analysis of raw signals without a reference genome. To this\nend, we propose Rawsamble, the first mechanism that can identify regions of\nsimilarity between all raw signal pairs, known as all-vs-all overlapping, using\na hash-based search mechanism. We show that an off-the-shelf assembler (i.e.,\nminiasm) can use the overlaps found by Rawsamble to construct genomes from\nscratch (i.e., de novo assembly). Our extensive evaluations across multiple\ngenomes of varying sizes show that Rawsamble provides a significant speedup (on\naverage by 4.48x and up to 23.10x) and reduces peak memory usage (on average by\n4.33x and up to by 22.00x) compared to a conventional genome assembly pipeline\nusing the state-of-the-art tools for basecalling (Dorado's fastest mode) and\noverlapping (minimap2) on a CPU. We find that 30.94% of overlapping pairs\ngenerated by Rawsamble are identical to those generated by minimap2. We further\nevaluate the benefits and directions that this new overlapping approach can\nenable in two ways. First, by constructing and evaluating the assembly graphs\nfrom the Rawsamble overlaps, we show that we can construct accurate and\ncontiguous assembly segments (unitigs) up to 2.3 million bases in length\n(almost half the genome length of E. coli). Second, we identify previously\nunexplored directions that can be enabled by finding overlaps and constructing\nde novo assemblies as well as the challenges to tackle these future directions.\nSource code: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash",

    "abstract": "With the growing number of forecasting techniques and the increasing\nsignificance of forecast-based operation - particularly in the rapidly evolving\nenergy sector - selecting the most effective forecasting model has become a\ncritical task. Given the dynamic nature of energy forecasting, it is highly\nadvantageous to assess the superiority of forecasting models not only\nretrospectively but continuously in real-time as new data and evidence becomes\navailable, while simultaneously providing strong probabilistic guarantees for\nthese decisions. In this work, we show that this can be achieved through the\nmathematical concept of e-values, which has recently gained massive attention\nin the field of statistics. It allows for unified construction principles for\npowerful tests and accurate statistical decisions, which can be evaluated at\nany chosen time points while maintaining an overall probabilistic error\ncontrol. We extend the use of e-values by developing a simple persistence\napproach that dynamically combines input forecasts to generate new fused\npredictions. To demonstrate the performance of our method we apply it to\nelectricity demand forecasts based on different artificial intelligence based\nmodels. Our results indicate that e-values are able to improve the accuracy and\nreliability of forecasts in a dynamic environment, offering a valuable tool for\nreal-time decision-making in the energy sector.",

    "abstract": "Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems significantly surpass traditional\nturn-based dialogue systems, as they allow simultaneous bidirectional\ncommunication, closely mirroring human-human interactions. However, achieving\nlow latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a\nsignificant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such\nas interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex\nconversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to\nnatural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex conversation\ncapabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively\nadapts a text large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue\nLLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the\narchitecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises three stages:\nmodality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue\nlearning. In all training stages, we standardize the data using a flattening\noperation, which enables unifying the training methods and the GPT backbone\nacross different modalities and tasks. Our approach offers a simple modeling\ntechnique and a promising research direction for developing efficient and\nnatural end-to-end full-duplex spoken dialogue systems.

Traditional approaches often rely on\nspecific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state.\nIn this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation\ndirectly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of\nthe subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the\nreduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in\nsystems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the\nevolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably\ndiminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of\noperators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models,\nincluding the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body\nlocalization, and the transverse field Ising chain.

Phenotypic plasticity\nand bet-hedging strategy, two key evolutionary traits living systems harness to\noptimize fitness in dynamic environments, have been widely reported yet how\ninterplays therein could mediate fitness landscapes of heterogeneous\npopulations remain unknown. Leveraging the financial asset pricing model, here\nwe provide a dynamical framework for fitness of heterogeneous populations,\nunderpinned by the interrelations between sub-populations exhibiting phenotypic\nplasticity and bet-hedgeding. Our framework, independent of the definition of\nfitness, employs a nonlinear difference equation to present fitness dynamics,\nand capture the emergence of tipping points, marking the onset of critical\nstate transitions which lead to catastrophic shifts. This study identifies\nlimits on the selective advantage conferred by bet-hedging through reduction in\nthe temporal variance of fitness, with far-reaching ramifications on our\ncurrent understanding of hedging-mediated fitness enhancement of a population.\nThe lower bound of the effective fitness variance is set by a maximum number of\nbet-hedgers, beyond which the fitness landscape approaches critical transition,\nas confirmed by critical slowing down in the vicinity of tipping points. We\nestimate the scaling law for the critical slowing down numerically and derive\nthe characteristic recovery time for heterogeneous populations.

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks\nseparately with specialized models.

Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively\ncaptures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner.\nThe model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or\nyet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent\nto classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions,\nuncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement\nin modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show\nthat TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player\nforecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball\nimputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE",

Our\nevaluation shows positive results in all metrics by employing domain\nadaptation, demonstrating strong performance on QA tasks and providing insights\ninto their efficacy in reducing hallucinations.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal fusion have witnessed the remarkable\nsuccess of vision-language (VL) models, which excel in various multimodal\napplications such as image captioning and visual question answering. However,\nbuilding VL models requires substantial hardware resources, where efficiency is\nrestricted by two key factors: the extended input sequence of the language\nmodel with vision features demands more computational operations, and a large\nnumber of additional learnable parameters increase memory complexity. These\nchallenges significantly restrict the broader applicability of such models. To\nbridge this gap, we propose ADEM-VL, an efficient vision-language method that\ntunes VL models based on pretrained large language models (LLMs) by adopting a\nparameter-free cross-attention mechanism for similarity measurements in\nmultimodal fusion. This approach only requires embedding vision features into\nthe language space, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters\nand accelerating both training and inference speeds. To enhance representation\nlearning in fusion module, we introduce an efficient multiscale feature\ngeneration scheme that requires only a single forward pass through the vision\nencoder. Moreover, we propose an adaptive fusion scheme that dynamically\ndiscards less relevant visual information for each text token based on its\nattention score. This ensures that the fusion process prioritizes the most\npertinent visual features. With experiments on various tasks including visual\nquestion answering, image captioning, and instruction-following, we demonstrate\nthat our framework outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, our method\nsurpasses existing methods by an average accuracy of 0.77% on ScienceQA\ndataset, with reduced training and inference latency, demonstrating the\nsuperiority of our framework.

We are given a set of $\\ell$ servers. On each\nserver we can schedule up to $k$ processes simultaneously. The demand is\ndescribed as a sequence of requests $\\sigma_t=\\{p_i, p_{j}\\}$, which means that\nthe two processes $p_i,p_{j}$ communicate. A process can be migrated from one\nserver to another which costs 1 unit per process move. If the communicating\nprocesses are on different servers, it further incurs a communication cost of 1\nunit for this request. The objective is to minimize the competitive ratio: the\ncost of serving such a request sequence compared to the cost incurred by an\noptimal offline algorithm.\n  Henzinger et al. (at SIGMETRICS 2019) introduced a learning variant of this\nproblem where the cost of an online algorithm is compared to the cost of a\nstatic offline algorithm that does not perform any communication, but which\nsimply learns the communication graph and keeps the discovered connected\ncomponents together. This problem variant was recently also studied at SODA\n2021.\n  In this paper, we consider a more general learning model (i.e., stronger\nadversary), where the offline algorithm is not restricted to keep connected\ncomponents together. Our main contribution are tight bounds for this problem.\nIn particular, we present two deterministic online algorithms: (1) an online\nalgorithm with competitive ratio $O(\\max(\\sqrt{k\\ell \\log k}, \\ell \\log k))$\nand augmentation $1+\\epsilon$; (2) an online algorithm with competitive ratio\n$O(\\sqrt{k})$ and augmentation $2+\\epsilon$.

In this paper, the studies of the\ncosmic muons registered by ALICE during Run 2 (2015--2018) are described. The\nanalysis is limited to multimuon events defined as events with more than four\ndetected muons ($N_\\mu>4$) and in the zenith angle range\n$0^{\\circ}<\\theta<50^{\\circ}$. The results are compared with Monte Carlo\nsimulations using three of the main hadronic interaction models describing the\nair shower development in the atmosphere: QGSJET-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL\n2.3d. The interval of the primary cosmic-ray energy involved in the measured\nmuon multiplicity distribution is about $ 4 \\times 10^{15}<E_\\mathrm{prim}< 6\n\\times 10^{16}$~eV. In this interval none of the three models is able to\ndescribe precisely the trend of the composition of cosmic rays as the energy\nincreases. However, QGSJET-II-04 is found to be the only model capable of\nreproducing reasonably well the muon multiplicity distribution, assuming a\nheavy composition of the primary cosmic rays over the whole energy range, while\nSIBYLL 2.3d and EPOS-LHC underpredict the number of muons in a large interval\nof multiplicity by more than $20\\%$ and $30\\%$, respectively. The rate of high\nmuon multiplicity events ($N_\\mu>100$) obtained with QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL\n2.3d is compatible with the data, while EPOS-LHC produces a significantly lower\nrate ($55\\%$ of the measured rate). For both QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d, the\nrate is close to the data when the composition is assumed to be dominated by\nheavy elements, an outcome compatible with the average energy $E_\\mathrm{prim}\n\\sim 10^{17}$ eV of these events.

By comparing the corresponding\nsingular vectors to eigenvectors of activation covariance matrices, we observe\nsubstantial overlap precisely where the spectra deviate from RMT expectations.\nOur analysis further reveals the important role of small singular values in\nLLMs, showing that these values contain significant information, a claim\nsupported by increased perplexity when they are removed from the model.\nAlthough these small values may appear unimportant prior to task-specific\nfine-tuning, removing them afterward significantly degrades performance,\nrevealing that fine-tuning refines the model primarily in these spectral\nregions.

However, contemporary QoS prediction\nmethods frequently encounter data sparsity and cold-start issues, which hinder\naccurate QoS predictions and limit the ability to capture diverse user\npreferences. Additionally, these methods often assume QoS data reliability,\nneglecting potential credibility issues such as outliers and the presence of\ngreysheep users and services with atypical invocation patterns.

HCTN combines a hypergraph structure with graph\nconvolution over hyper-edges to effectively address high-sparsity issues by\ncapturing complex, high-order correlations. Complementing this, the transformer\nnetwork utilizes multi-head attention along with parallel 1D convolutional\nlayers and fully connected dense blocks to capture both fine-grained and\ncoarse-grained dynamic patterns.

This paper argues that the field of computational literary\nstudies is the ideal place to conduct a study of intertextuality since we have\nnow the ability to systematically compare texts with each others. Specifically,\nwe present a work on a corpus of more than 12.000 French fictions from the\n18th, 19th and early 20th century.

Previous\nresearch (Hughes, 2012) supports the existence of a literary \"style of a time\",\nand our findings further reinforce this concept. Our findings also suggest that\nboth subgenres and canonicity play a significant role in shaping textual\nsimilarities within French fiction.

This concerns particularly\nsmall-scale flows and, more generally, highly-resolved liquid-gas simulations\nwith moderate inertia. To date, the majority of interfacial-flow simulations\nare performed using an explicit surface-tension treatment, which restrains the\nperformance of such simulations. Recently, an implicit treatment of surface\ntension able to breach the capillary time-step constraint using the\nvolume-of-fluid (VOF) method was proposed, based on a fully-coupled\npressure-based finite-volume algorithm. To this end, the interface-advection\nequation is incorporated implicitly into the linear flow solver, resulting in a\ntight coupling between all implicit solution variables (colour function,\npressure, velocity). However, this algorithm is limited to uniform density and\nviscosity fields. Here, we present a fully-coupled algorithm for interfacial\nflows with implicit surface tension applicable to interfacial flows with large\ndensity and viscosity ratios. This is achieved by solving the continuity and\nmomentum equations in conservative form, whereby the density is treated\nimplicitly with respect to the colour function, and the advection term of the\ninterface-advection equation is discretised using the THINC/QQ algebraic VOF\nscheme, yielding a consistent discretisation of the advective terms. This new\nalgorithm is tested by considering representative surface-tension-dominated\ninterfacial flows, including the Laplace equilibrium of a stationary droplet\nand the three-dimensional Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a liquid filament.\nThe presented results demonstrate that interfacial flows with large density and\nviscosity ratios can be simulated and energy conservation is ensured, even with\na time step larger than the capillary time-step constraint.",

As incidents of\nviolence continue to rise globally, there is an urgent need for effective\nsurveillance technologies that can quickly identify potential threats. Our\napproach focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to create a\nhighly accurate and efficient system capable of detecting weapons in real-time\nvideo streams. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset containing\nthousands of images depicting various types of firearms and edged weapons,\nensuring a robust learning process. We evaluated the model's performance using\nkey metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision\n(mAP) across multiple Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, revealing a\nsignificant capability to differentiate between weapon and non-weapon classes\nwith minimal error. Furthermore, we assessed the system's operational\nefficiency, demonstrating that it can process frames at high speeds suitable\nfor real-time applications. The findings indicate that our YOLOv8-based weapon\ndetection model not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge in\ncomputer vision but also addresses critical societal needs for improved safety\nmeasures in vulnerable environments.

This is adeptly fused with the cutting-edge neural\nradiance field technology, Instant-NGP, and the state-of-the-art articulated\nmodel, Fast-SNARF, to enhance the reconstruction fidelity and speed. By\ncombining these two technologies, a system is created that can render quickly\nand effectively while also providing estimation of human pose parameters that\nare unmatched in accuracy. We have enhanced our system with an advanced\nposture-sensitive space reduction technique, which optimally balances rendering\nquality with computational efficiency. In our detailed experimental analysis\nusing both artificial and real-world monocular videos, we establish the\nadvanced performance of our approach. HumanAvatar consistently equals or\nsurpasses contemporary leading-edge reconstruction techniques in quality.\nFurthermore, it achieves these complex reconstructions in minutes, a fraction\nof the time typically required by existing methods. Our models achieve a\ntraining speed that is 110X faster than that of State-of-The-Art (SoTA)\nNeRF-based models. Our technique performs noticeably better than SoTA dynamic\nhuman NeRF methods if given an identical runtime limit. HumanAvatar can provide\neffective visuals after only 30 seconds of training.",

    "abstract": "The field of autonomous navigation for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is in\ncontinuous growth and increasing levels of autonomy have been reached in the\nlast few years. However, the task becomes more challenging when the focus is on\nthe exploration of planet surfaces such as Mars. In those situations, UGVs are\nforced to navigate through unstable and rugged terrains which, inevitably, open\nthe vehicle to more hazards, accidents, and, in extreme cases, complete mission\nfailure. The paper addresses the challenges of autonomous navigation for\nunmanned ground vehicles in planetary exploration, particularly on Mars,\nintroducing a hybrid architecture for terrain traversability analysis that\ncombines two approaches: appearance-based and geometry-based. The\nappearance-based method uses semantic segmentation via deep neural networks to\nclassify different terrain types. This is further refined by pixel-level\nterrain roughness classification obtained from the same RGB image, assigning\ndifferent costs based on the physical properties of the soil. The\ngeometry-based method complements the appearance-based approach by evaluating\nthe terrain's geometrical features, identifying hazards that may not be\ndetectable by the appearance-based side. The outputs of both methods are\ncombined into a comprehensive hybrid cost map. The proposed architecture was\ntrained on synthetic datasets and developed as a ROS2 application to integrate\ninto broader autonomous navigation systems for harsh environments. Simulations\nhave been performed in Unity, showing the ability of the method to assess\nonline traversability analysis.",

A point-wise\nobservation of the process (in other words, observing $h(X_t)$ in isolation)\ncannot identify $X_t$ unless the $h$ is injective. However observing $h(X_s)$\non a small interval $[t,t+\\varepsilon]$ can be enough to determine $X_t$\nexactly. The paper contain results that expand on this idea; in particular, a\nproperty of `fine total asymmetry' of twice continuously differentiable $h$ is\nintroduced that depends on the fine topology of potential theory and that is\nboth necessary and sufficient for $X$ to be adapted to a natural\nright-continuous filtration generated by the observations. This particular\nfiltration, though augmented with null sets, does not depend on the\ndistribution of $X_0$. For real-analytic $h$ the property reduces to simple\nasymmetry; that is, there is no nontrivial affine isometry $\\kappa$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $h = h \\circ \\kappa$. A second result concerns the\ncase where $X_0$ is given and $h$ is merely Borel; then $X$ is adapted to an\naugmented filtration generated by the observation process $(h(X_t))_{t\\geq 0}$\nif $h$ is `locally invertible' on a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ dense in the fine\ntopology on $\\mathbb{R}^d$.",

Experimental results demonstrate that on the KITTI dataset,\nthe YOLO-Vehicle-v1s model achieved 92.1% accuracy while maintaining a\ndetection speed of 226 FPS and an inference time of 12ms, meeting the real-time\nrequirements of autonomous driving.

Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark\nmatter in Earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is\nmore than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter including\nthe two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter\nspecies(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter\nparticles (subdominant) in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter\nspecies is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves\n(semi)relativistic velocity or {\\it boost}. These boosted dark matter particles\nsuffer from scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere\nand the Earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the\nkinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two-component dark\nmatter framework, we examine how the boost of the dark matter influences the\nattenuation of kinetic energy across a broad spectrum of dark matter masses. We\nperform a detailed study at various DM-electron and DM-nucleus cross sections\nincluding the effect of nuclear form factor and elastic and inelastic\nscattering (for large kinetic energy). For a 10 MeV boosted dark matter with\nboost $\\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe\nthan the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) if DM-nucleon scattering\ncross section is $10^{-29}$cm$^2$.

Although the early Universe is supposed to\nbe extremely flat from an inflationary point of view, the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) data alone from the Planck satellite measurement prefers an\nenhanced lensing amplitude that can be explained by a closed Universe. In this\npaper, we propose an independent method to constrain the early-universe\nflatness from the anisotropies of CGWB. Using the generalized harmonic\ndecompositions in the non-flat spacetime, we find CGWBs from different physical\nmechanisms such as cosmic inflation and phase transitions share the same\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) term but possess different SW terms, which would\nexhibit different behaviors when including the spatial curvature since the ISW\neffect is more sensitive to the spatial curvature than the SW effect.\nFurthermore, we provide the cross-correlations between CGWB and CMB, implying a\npositive or negative correlation between their SW effect terms depending on the\nGW mechanisms, which may hint at the sign of $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ when considering\nnon-Gaussianity contributions to anisotropies.",

However, modelling cloud\nformation consistently within the 3D atmosphere remains computationally\nchallenging. The aim is to explore the combined atmospheric and micro-physical\ncloud structure, and the kinetic gas-phase chemistry for the warm Saturn\nHATS0-6b orbiting an M-dwarf. A combined 3D cloudy atmosphere model is\nconstructed by iteratively executing the 3D General Circulation Model (GCM)\nexpeRT/MITgcm and a kinetic cloud formation model, each in its full complexity.\nResulting cloud particle number densities, sizes, and compositions are used to\nderive the local cloud opacity which is then utilised in the next GCM\niteration. The disequilibrium H/C/O/N gas-phase chemistry is calculated for\neach iteration to assess the resulting transmission spectrum in\npost-processing. The cloud opacity feedback causes a temperature inversion at\nthe sub-stellar point and at the evening terminator at gas pressures higher\nthan 0.01 bar. Furthermore, clouds cool the atmosphere between 0.01 bar and 10\nbar, and narrow the equatorial wind jet. The transmission spectrum shows muted\ngas-phase absorption and a cloud particle silicate feature at approximately 10\nmicron. The combined atmosphere-cloud model retains the full physical\ncomplexity of each component and therefore enables a detailed physical\ninterpretation with JWST NIRSpec and MIRI LRS observational accuracy. The model\nshows that warm Saturn type exoplanets around M-dwarfs are ideal candidates to\nsearch for limb asymmetries in clouds and chemistry, identify cloud particle\ncomposition by observing their spectral features, and identify the\ncloud-induced strong thermal inversion that arises on these planets\nspecifically.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across various fields,\nmodel compression has become increasingly crucial for reducing costs and\nimproving inference efficiency. Post-training pruning is a promising method\nthat does not require resource-intensive iterative training and only needs a\nsmall amount of calibration data to assess the importance of parameters. Recent\nresearch has enhanced post-training pruning from different aspects but few of\nthem systematically explore the effects of calibration data, and it is unclear\nif there exist better calibration data construction strategies. We fill this\nblank and surprisingly observe that calibration data is also crucial to\npost-training pruning, especially for high sparsity. Through controlled\nexperiments on important influence factors of calibration data, including the\npruning settings, the amount of data, and its similarity with pre-training\ndata, we observe that a small size of data is adequate, and more similar data\nto its pre-training stage can yield better performance. As pre-training data is\nusually inaccessible for advanced LLMs, we further provide a self-generating\ncalibration data synthesis strategy to construct feasible calibration data.\nExperimental results on recent strong open-source LLMs (e.g., DCLM, and\nLLaMA-3) show that the proposed strategy can enhance the performance of strong\npruning methods (e.g., Wanda, DSnoT, OWL) by a large margin (up to $2.68\\%$).\nCode is available at https://github.com/Dereck0602/calibration_data.",

We perform general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics\n(GR-RMHD) simulations of super-Eddington accretion flows onto a magnetized NS\nwith dipole and/or quadrupole magnetic fields. Our results show that an\naccretion disk and optically thick outflows form outside the magnetospheric\nradius, while inflows aligned with magnetic field lines appear inside. When the\ndipole field is more prominent than the quadrupole field at the magnetospheric\nradius, accretion columns form near the magnetic poles, whereas a quadrupole\nmagnetic field stronger than the dipole field results in the formation of a\nbelt-like accretion flow near the equatorial plane. The NS spins up as the\nangular momentum of the accreting gas is converted into the angular momentum of\nthe electromagnetic field, which then flows into the NS. Even if an accretion\ncolumn forms near one of the magnetic poles, the observed luminosity is almost\nthe same on both sides with the accretion column and the side without it\nbecause the radiation energy is transported to both sides through scattering.\nOur model suggests that galactic ULXP, Swift J0243.6+6124, has a quadrupole\nmagnetic field of $2\\times10^{13}~{\\rm G}$ and a dipole magnetic field of less\nthan $4\\times10^{12}~{\\rm G}$.",

While it has been broadly investigated for over a decade both in\nvivo and in vitro, large scale coherent flocking phases remain underexplored\nand have so far been mostly described as fluid. In this work, we report a mode\nof large-scale collective motion for different epithelial cell types in vitro\nwith distinctive new features. By tracking individual cells, we show that cells\nmove over long time scales coherently not as a fluid, but as a polar elastic\nsolid with negligible cell rearrangements. Our analysis reveals that this solid\nflocking phase exhibits signatures of long-range polar order, unprecedented in\ncellular systems, such as scale-free correlations, anomalously large density\nfluctuations, and shear waves. Based on a general theory of active polar\nsolids, we argue that these features result from massless Goldstone modes,\nwhich, in contrast to polar fluids where they are generic, require the\ndecoupling of global rotations of the polarity and in-plane elastic\ndeformations in polar solids. We theoretically show and consistently observe in\nexperiments that the fluctuations of elastic deformations diverge for large\nsystem size in such polar active solid phases, leading eventually to rupture\nand thus potentially loss of tissue integrity at large scales.",

Our comprehensive\nmodel traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and\ninto the SN remnant (SNR) phase. We simulate the remnant's expansion over\napproximately 15 years, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star's\noutflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the\nremnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from $4.3\\times\n10^{16}\\,$cm to $1.5\\times 10^{17}$ cm in the equatorial plane, with a\nthickness of approximately $1.2\\times 10^{17}$ cm. The nebula's density peaks\nat approximately $3\\times 10^6\\,$cm$^{-3}$ at the inner boundary, gradually\ndecreasing as $\\approx r^{-2}$ at greater distances. This nebula formed due to\nintense mass-loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000\nyears before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached\nabout $8\\times 10^{-4}\\,M_{\\odot}\\,$yr$^{-1}$, ejecting $\\approx\n2.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately\nreproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the Fe K line, throughout the\nremnant's evolution.

The impact of selecting each SPL is\ncompared to the consequence of changing the model implementation in the SED\nfitting process, including the implementation of metallicity evolution versus a\nfixed or constant metallicity, and a functional parametric star formation\nhistory (SFH) versus a stepwise parametric (or \"non-parametric\") SFH.\nFurthermore, we use ProGeny to assess the impact of sub-SPL choices, including\nisochrone selection, stellar spectra selection, and IMF selection. Through a\ncomparison of derived stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities,\nages, and the inferred cosmic star formation history (CSFH), we rank the impact\nof varying choices. Overall the assumption of a solar metallicity creates the\ngreatest biases, with a substantial impact also caused by the choice of a\nspecific SPL. To recover a CSFH most consistent with observations, we advocate\nfor the use of the fiducial implementation with a skewed Normal functional form\nfor the SFH, and an evolving metallicity, although we note that all studied\nSPLs underestimate the peak in the CSFH.",

Introducing new information to a machine learning system can interfere\nwith previously stored data and potentially alter the global model paradigm,\nespecially when dealing with non-stationary sources.

While these approaches mainly deal with control flow variability, in\nprevious work we introduced an approach to manage implementation variants of\ndigitised business processes. In this context Software Product Line (SPL)\nEngineering was applied to manage a set of common core artefacts including a\nprocess model from which Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS) can be\nderived, which differ in the implementation of their process activities. When\nderiving a PAIS, implementations are selected for each process activity and\nthen included in the PAIS at compilation time.

Consequently, it becomes\npossible to defer the decision as to which implementation should be selected to\nstart time and runtime. Furthermore, multiple implementations of a particular\nactivity may be selected and executed concurrently. The presented approach also\nallows customising the input and output data of activities.

The HSC-y band magnitudes show that\nour LAEs are UV-bright, with rest-frame absolute UV magnitudes -19.7 < $M_{UV}$\n< -23.3. We find that the Lya line width increases with luminosity, and this\ntrend becomes more prominent at z > 6 where Lya lines become significantly\nbroadened (> 260 $kms^{-1}$) at luminosities log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$]) > 43.\nThis broadening is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that these\nsources are located inside larger ionized bubbles. We observe a slightly\nelevated ionizing photon production efficiency estimated for LAEs at z > 6,\nindicating that younger galaxies could be producing more ionizing photons per\nUV luminosity. A tentative anti-correlation between ionizing photon production\nefficiency and Lya rest-frame equivalent width is noticed, which could indicate\na time delay between production and escape of ionizing photon primarily due to\nsupernovae activity. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between bubble\nradius and Lya line width, which again suggests that large ionized bubbles are\ncreated around these LAEs, allowing them to self-shield from the scattering\neffects of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We also detect two closely separated\nLAEs at z=6.046 (projected spatial separation is 15.92 kpc). The size of their\nrespective bubbles suggests that they likely sit inside a common large ionized\nregion. Such a closely-separated LAE pair increases the size of ionized bubble,\npotentially allowing a boosted transmission of Lya through neutral IGM.\n(Abridged)",

Otherwise, robber wins. The minimum number of cops\nneeded to win the game on a graph $G$ is the $k$-hyperopic cop number\n$c_{H,k}(G)$ of $G$.\n  In addition to basic properties of the new invariant, cop-win graphs are\ncharacterized and a general upper bound in terms of the matching number of the\ngraph is given. The invariant is also studied on trees where the upper bounds\nmostly depend on the relation between $k$ and the diameter of the tree.

RhSi exists\nin two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The\nnoncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting\nunconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure,\nwhich crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and\nbelongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we\ninvestigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi\ntextured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the\northorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current\ntransport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge\ncurrent conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally\ndetermined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value\nof 126 ($\\hbar$/e)($\\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well\nwith first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi\nto the spin Berry curvature mechanism.

Despite significant\nprogress, it remains challenging to deterministically create SPEs at precise\nlocations with a specific type of element for creating defects. In this study,\nwe present a straightforward approach to generate site-deterministic\ncarbon-functionalized quantum emitters in hBN by harnessing ultrasonic\nnanoindentation. The obtained SPEs are high-quality and can be scaled up to\nlarge arrays in a single fabrication step. Comprehensive experimental analyses\nreveal that the insertion of carbon atoms into the hBN lattice is the source of\nthe robust quantum emission. Complementary theoretical studies suggest possible\ncandidates for the structural origin of the defects based on our experimental\nresults.

This capability is necessary for agents to remain effective\nwhen deployed in dynamically changing environments, such as an enterprise\nnetwork where devices may frequently join and leave. Standard approaches to\ndeep reinforcement learning, where policies are parameterised using a\nfixed-input multi-layer perceptron (MLP) expect fixed-size observation and\naction spaces. In autonomous cyber defence, this makes it hard to develop\nagents that generalise to environments with network topologies different from\nthose trained on, as the number of nodes affects the natural size of the\nobservation and action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we reframe the\nproblem of autonomous network defence using entity-based reinforcement\nlearning, where the observation and action space of an agent are decomposed\ninto a collection of discrete entities. This framework enables the use of\npolicy parameterisations specialised in compositional generalisation. We train\na Transformer-based policy on the Yawning Titan cyber-security simulation\nenvironment and test its generalisation capabilities across various network\ntopologies. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an\nMLP-based policy when training across fixed-size networks of varying\ntopologies, and matches performance when training on a single network. We also\ndemonstrate the potential for zero-shot generalisation to networks of a\ndifferent size to those seen in training.

However, the computational complexity of solving a\nreceding horizon problem at each time step remains a challenge for the\ndeployment of MPC. This is particularly the case for systems constrained by\nmany inequalities. Recently, we introduced the concept of constraint-adaptive\nMPC (ca-MPC) to address this challenge for linear systems with hard\nconstraints. In ca-MPC, at each time step, a subset of the constraints is\nremoved from the optimization problem, thereby accelerating the optimization\nprocedure, while resulting in identical closed-loop behavior. The present paper\nextends this framework to soft-constrained MPC by detecting and removing\nconstraints based on sub-optimal predicted input sequences, which is rather\neasy for soft-constrained MPC due to the receding horizon principle and the\ninclusion of slack variables. We will translate these new ideas explicitly to\nan offset-free output tracking problem. The effectiveness of these ideas is\ndemonstrated on a two-dimensional thermal transport model, showing a three\norder of magnitude improvement in online computational time of the MPC scheme.",

Additionally, we used Monte Carlo simulations\nto determine the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic and spin reorientation transition\ntemperatures for various morphology parameters and we show how\nnanoconstrictions and shapes of the atomic clusters can modify these transition\ntemperatures. Our results demonstrate the possibility to account for the\nmorphology of ultrathin structures with significant roughness. We believe that\nour approach makes it possible to model complete devices as close as possible\nto experimental reality.",

    "abstract": "Visual preference alignment involves training Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) to predict human preferences between visual inputs. This is typically\nachieved by using labeled datasets of chosen/rejected pairs and employing\noptimization algorithms like direct preference optimization (DPO). Existing\nvisual alignment methods, primarily designed for single-image scenarios,\nstruggle to effectively handle the complexity of multi-image tasks due to the\nscarcity of diverse training data and the high cost of annotating\nchosen/rejected pairs. We present Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference\nOptimization (MIA-DPO), a visual preference alignment approach that effectively\nhandles multi-image inputs. MIA-DPO mitigates the scarcity of diverse\nmulti-image training data by extending single-image data with unrelated images\narranged in grid collages or pic-in-pic formats, significantly reducing the\ncosts associated with multi-image data annotations. Our observation reveals\nthat attention values of LVLMs vary considerably across different images. We\nuse attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses the model\nmay have mistakenly focused on. Our attention-aware selection for constructing\nthe chosen/rejected pairs without relying on (i) human annotation, (ii) extra\ndata, and (iii) external models or APIs. MIA-DPO is compatible with various\narchitectures and outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks,\nachieving an average performance boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on the\nrecent InternLM-XC2.5.

One of the most common use cases is conversational interactions,\nenabled by the language generation capabilities of LLMs. Just as between two\nhumans, a conversation between an LLM-powered entity and a human depends on the\npersonality of the conversants. However, measuring the personality of a given\nLLM is currently a challenge. This paper introduces the Language Model\nLinguistic Personality Assessment (LMLPA), a system designed to evaluate the\nlinguistic personalities of LLMs. Our system helps to understand LLMs' language\ngeneration capabilities by quantitatively assessing the distinct personality\ntraits reflected in their linguistic outputs. Unlike traditional human-centric\npsychometrics, the LMLPA adapts a personality assessment questionnaire,\nspecifically the Big Five Inventory, to align with the operational capabilities\nof LLMs, and also incorporates the findings from previous language-based\npersonality measurement literature. To mitigate sensitivity to the order of\noptions, our questionnaire is designed to be open-ended, resulting in textual\nanswers. Thus, the AI rater is needed to transform ambiguous personality\ninformation from text responses into clear numerical indicators of personality\ntraits. Utilising Principal Component Analysis and reliability validations, our\nfindings demonstrate that LLMs possess distinct personality traits that can be\neffectively quantified by the LMLPA. This research contributes to\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Human-Centered AI, providing a robust framework\nfor future studies to refine AI personality assessments and expand their\napplications in multiple areas, including education and manufacturing.",

Most current work focuses on supervised learning, which requires a\nlarge amount of labeled and diverse images, while FER suffers from the scarcity\nof large, diverse datasets and annotation difficulty. To address these\nproblems, we focus on utilizing large unlabeled Face Recognition (FR) datasets\nto boost semi-supervised FER. Specifically, we first perform face\nreconstruction pre-training on large-scale facial images without annotations to\nlearn features of facial geometry and expression regions, followed by two-stage\nfine-tuning on FER datasets with limited labels. In addition, to further\nalleviate the scarcity of labeled and diverse images, we propose a Mixup-based\ndata augmentation strategy tailored for facial images, and the loss weights of\nreal and virtual images are determined according to the intersection-over-union\n(IoU) of the faces in the two images. Experiments on RAF-DB, AffectNet, and\nFERPlus show that our method outperforms existing semi-supervised FER methods\nand achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, with only 5%, 25%\ntraining sets,our method achieves 64.02% on AffectNet,and 88.23% on RAF-DB,\nwhich is comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art methods.

The {\\it Fraunhofer distance} which is the boundary\nbetween near and far field has been well studied in the literature on the\nprincipal axis (PA) of single-element center-fed antennas, where PA denotes the\naxis perpendicular to the antenna surface passing from the antenna center. The\nresults are also valid for phased arrays if the PA coincides with the\nboresight, which is not commonly the case in practice. In this work, we\ncompletely characterize the Fraunhofer distance by considering various angles\nbetween the PA and the boresight. For the {\\it radial-focal distance}, below\nwhich beamfocusing is feasible in the radial domain, a formal characterization\nof the corresponding region based on the general model of near-field channels\n(GNC) is missing in the literature. We investigate this and elaborate that the\nmaximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) beamforming based on the simple uniform\nspherical wave (USW) channel model results in a radial gap between the achieved\nand the desired focal points. While the gap vanishes when the array size $N$\nbecomes sufficiently large, we propose a practical algorithm to remove this gap\nin the non-asymptotic case when $N$ is not very large. Finally, the {\\it\nnon-radiating} distance, below which the reactive power dominates active power,\nhas been studied in the literature for single-element antennas. We analytically\nexplore this for phased arrays and show how different excitation phases of the\nantenna array impact it.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of how to integrate\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with cooperative non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA), considering URLLC. We consider a downlink two-user\ncooperative NOMA system employing short-packet communications, where the two\nusers are denoted by the central user (CU) and the cell-edge user (CEU),\nrespectively, and an RIS is deployed to enhance signal quality. Specifically,\ncompared to CEU, CU lies nearer from BS and enjoys the higher channel gains.\nClosed-form expressions for the CU's average block error rate (BLER) are\nderived. Furthermore, we evaluate the CEU's BLER performance utilizing\nselective combining (SC) and derive a tight lower bound under maximum ratio\ncombining (MRC). Simulation results are provided to our analyses and\ndemonstrate that the RIS-assisted system significantly outperforms its\ncounterpart without RIS in terms of BLER. Notably, MRC achieves a squared\nmultiple of the diversity gain of the SC, leading to more reliable performance,\nespecially for the CEU. Furthermore, by dividing the RIS into two zones, each\ndedicated to a specific user, the average BLER can be further reduced,\nparticularly for the CEU.",

Nonetheless, conventional DFKD methods that employ\nsynthesized training data are prone to the limitations of inadequate diversity\nand discrepancies in distribution between the synthesized and original\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative\napproach to DFKD through diverse diffusion augmentation (DDA). Specifically, we\nrevise the paradigm of common data synthesis in DFKD to a composite process\nthrough leveraging diffusion models subsequent to data synthesis for\nself-supervised augmentation, which generates a spectrum of data samples with\nsimilar distributions while retaining controlled variations. Furthermore, to\nmitigate excessive deviation in the embedding space, we introduce an image\nfiltering technique grounded in cosine similarity to maintain fidelity during\nthe knowledge distillation process.

The same cyl. coordinates have also been widely used for\nrepresenting 3D MHD equilibria of non-axisymmetric configurations\n(stellarators), with cross-sections, defined in RZ-planes, that vary over\n$\\phi$. Stellarator equilibria have been found, however, for which cyl.\ncoordinates are not at all a natural choice, for instance certain stellarators\nobtained using the near-axis expansion (NAE), defined by a magn. axis curve and\nits Frenet frame.\n  In this contribution, we propose an alternative approach for representing the\nboundary in a fixed-boundary 3D MHD equil. solver, moving away from cyl.\ncoordinates. Instead, we use planar cross-sections whose orientation is\ndetermined by a general coordinate frame (G-Frame). This frame is similar to\nthe conventional Frenet frame, but more flexible. As an additional part of the\nboundary representation, it becomes an input to the equil. solve, along with\nthe geometry of the cross-sections. We see two advantages: 1) the capability to\neasily represent configurations where the magn. axis is highly non-planar or\neven knotted 2) a reduction in the degrees of freedom needed for the boundary\nsurface, and thus the equil. solver, enabling progress in optimization of these\nconfigurations.\n  We discuss the properties of the G-Frame, starting from the conventional\nFrenet frame. Then we show two exemplary ways of constructing it, first from a\nNAE solution and also from a given boundary surface. We present the details of\nthe implementation of the new frame in the 3D MHD equil. solver GVEC.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate for a highly shaped QI-optimized stellarator that\nfar fewer degrees of freedom are necessary to find a high quality equil.\nsolution, compared to the solution computed in cyl. coordinates.",

    "abstract": "Custom diffusion models (CDMs) have attracted widespread attention due to\ntheir astonishing generative ability for personalized concepts. However, most\nexisting CDMs unreasonably assume that personalized concepts are fixed and\ncannot change over time. Moreover, they heavily suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and concept neglect on old personalized concepts when continually\nlearning a series of new concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel Concept-Incremental text-to-image Diffusion Model (CIDM), which can\nresolve catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect to learn new customization\ntasks in a concept-incremental manner. Specifically, to surmount the\ncatastrophic forgetting of old concepts, we develop a concept consolidation\nloss and an elastic weight aggregation module. They can explore task-specific\nand task-shared knowledge during training, and aggregate all low-rank weights\nof old concepts based on their contributions during inference. Moreover, in\norder to address concept neglect, we devise a context-controllable synthesis\nstrategy that leverages expressive region features and noise estimation to\ncontrol the contexts of generated images according to user conditions.\nExperiments validate that our CIDM surpasses existing custom diffusion models.\nThe source codes are available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/CIFC.",

However, it is still\nchallenging to enhance performance them without sharing private data and models\nfrom individual parties. One recent promising approach is to develop\ndistillation-based algorithms that exploit unlabeled public data but the\nresults are still unsatisfactory in both theory and practice. To tackle this\nproblem, we rigorously analyze a representative distillation-based algorithm in\nthe view of kernel regression. This work provides the first theoretical results\nto prove the (nearly) minimax optimality of the nonparametric collaborative\nlearning algorithm that does not directly share local data or models in\nmassively distributed statistically heterogeneous environments. Inspired by our\ntheoretical results, we also propose a practical distillation-based\ncollaborative learning algorithm based on neural network architecture. Our\nalgorithm successfully bridges the gap between our theoretical assumptions and\npractical settings with neural networks through feature kernel matching. We\nsimulate various regression tasks to verify our theory and demonstrate the\npractical feasibility of our proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "At millimeter wavelengths, the atmospheric emission is circularly polarized\nowing to the Zeeman splitting of molecular oxygen by the Earth's magnetic\nfield. We report a measurement of the signal in the 150 GHz band using 3 years\nof observational data with the \\textsc{Polarbear} project. Non-idealities of a\ncontinuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP) partially convert circularly\npolarized light to linearly polarized light. While \\textsc{Polarbear} detectors\nare sensitive to linear polarization, this effect makes them sensitive to\ncircular polarization. Although this was not the intended use, we utilized this\nconversion to measure circular polarization. We reconstruct the azimuthal\ngradient of the circular polarization signal and measure its dependency from\nthe scanning direction and the detector bandpass. We compare the signal with a\nsimulation based on atmospheric emission theory, the detector bandpass, and the\nHWP leakage spectrum model. We find the ratio of the observed azimuthal slope\nto the simulated slope is $0.92 \\pm 0.01\\rm{(stat)} \\pm 0.07\\rm{(sys)}$. This\nratio corresponds to a brightness temperature of $3.8\\,\\mathrm{m K}$ at the\neffective band center of $121.8\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$ and bandwidth of\n$3.5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$ estimated from representative detector bandpass and the\nspectrum of Zeeman emission. This result validates our understanding of the\ninstrument and reinforces the feasibility of measuring the circular\npolarization using the imperfection of continuously rotating HWP. Continuously\nrotating HWP is popular in ongoing and future cosmic microwave background\nexperiments to modulate the polarized signal. This work shows a method for\nsignal extraction and leakage subtraction that can help measuring circular\npolarization in such experiments.",

    "abstract": "We propose the first learning scheme for functional differential equations\n(FDEs). FDEs play a fundamental role in physics, mathematics, and optimal\ncontrol. However, the numerical analysis of FDEs has faced challenges due to\nits unrealistic computational costs and has been a long standing problem over\ndecades. Thus, numerical approximations of FDEs have been developed, but they\noften oversimplify the solutions. To tackle these two issues, we propose a\nhybrid approach combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the\n\\textit{cylindrical approximation}. The cylindrical approximation expands\nfunctions and functional derivatives with an orthonormal basis and transforms\nFDEs into high-dimensional PDEs. To validate the reliability of the cylindrical\napproximation for FDE applications, we prove the convergence theorems of\napproximated functional derivatives and solutions. Then, the derived\nhigh-dimensional PDEs are numerically solved with PINNs. Through the\ncapabilities of PINNs, our approach can handle a broader class of functional\nderivatives more efficiently than conventional discretization-based methods,\nimproving the scalability of the cylindrical approximation. As a proof of\nconcept, we conduct experiments on two FDEs and demonstrate that our model can\nsuccessfully achieve typical $L^1$ relative error orders of PINNs $\\sim\n10^{-3}$. Overall, our work provides a strong backbone for physicists,\nmathematicians, and machine learning experts to analyze previously challenging\nFDEs, thereby democratizing their numerical analysis, which has received\nlimited attention.

Our study uncovers significant shortcomings in current\ngraph condensation techniques. First, the majority of the algorithms\nparadoxically require training on the full dataset to perform condensation.\nSecond, due to their gradient-emulating approach, these methods require fresh\ncondensation for any change in hyperparameters or GNN architecture, limiting\ntheir flexibility and reusability. Finally, they fail to achieve substantial\nsize reduction due to synthesizing fully-connected, edge-weighted graphs.

Bonsai condenses datasets\nby encoding a careful selection of \\textit{exemplar} trees that maximize the\nrepresentation of all computation trees in the training set. This unique\napproach imparts Bonsai as the first linear-time, model-agnostic graph\ncondensation algorithm for node classification that outperforms existing\nbaselines across $7$ real-world datasets on accuracy, while being $22$ times\nfaster on average.

To bridge this gap\nand examine whether evaluator LLMs can reliably assess the outputs of\nmultilingual LLMs, we introduce MM-Eval, a multilingual meta-evaluation\nbenchmark comprising five core subsets covering 18 languages and a Language\nConsistency subset spanning 122 languages. A core attribute of MM-Eval is that,\ninstead of merely translating existing English meta-evaluation benchmarks, it\nis designed with multilingual-specific challenges in mind. Additionally, unlike\nexisting meta-evaluation benchmarks that focus solely on ranking accuracy over\npairwise data, MM-Eval also evaluates the consistency and fairness of absolute\nscore values across a wide range of languages. Our results show that existing\nevaluator LLMs that excel in English contexts have considerable room for\nimprovement when assessing non-English outputs. Furthermore, we find that\nevaluators are unfair and inconsistent when evaluating lower-resourced\nlanguages.

Cutting sound detection using machine\nlearning (ML) models, inspired by experienced machinists, can be employed as a\ncost-effective and non-intrusive monitoring method in a complex manufacturing\nenvironment. However, labeling industry data for training is costly and\ntime-consuming. Moreover, industry data is often scarce. In this study, we\npropose a novel adversarial domain adaptation (DA) approach to leverage\nabundant lab data to learn from scarce industry data, both labeled, for\ntraining a cutting-sound detection model. Rather than adapting the features\nfrom separate domains directly, we project them first into two separate latent\nspaces that jointly work as the feature space for learning domain-independent\nrepresentations. We also analyze two different mechanisms for adversarial\nlearning where the discriminator works as an adversary and a critic in separate\nsettings, enabling our model to learn expressive domain-invariant and\ndomain-ingrained features, respectively. We collected cutting sound data from\nmultiple sensors in different locations, prepared datasets from lab and\nindustry domain, and evaluated our learning models on them.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving\nprivacy. Recently, the integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has\nenhanced performance but introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism.\nAttackers can exploit FM vulnerabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data\ngenerated by FMs. During global model fusion, these backdoors are transferred\nto the global model through compromised synthetic data, subsequently infecting\nall client models. Existing FL backdoor defenses are ineffective against this\nnovel attack due to its fundamentally different mechanism compared to classic\nones. In this work, we propose a novel data-free defense strategy that\naddresses both classic and novel backdoor attacks in FL. The shared attack\npattern lies in the abnormal activations within the hidden feature space during\nmodel aggregation. Hence, we propose to constrain internal activations to\nremain within reasonable ranges, effectively mitigating attacks while\npreserving model functionality. The activation constraints are optimized using\nsynthetic data alongside FL training.

    "abstract": "Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has attracted attention as an emerging\ntechnology that will bring innovation to urban transportation and aviation\nsystems. Since the UAM systems pursue fully autonomous flight without a pilot,\nwireless communication is a key function not only for flight control signals,\nbut also for navigation and safety information. The essential information is\ncalled a command and control (C2) message, and the UAM networks must be\nconfigured so that the UAM can receive the C2 message by securing a continuous\nlink stability without any interruptions. Nevertheless, a lot of prior works\nhave focused only on improving the average performance without solving the\nlow-reliability in the cell edges and coverage holes of urban areas. In this\ndissertation, we identify the factors that hinder the communication link\nreliability in considering three-dimensional (3D) urban environments, and\npropose a antenna configuration, resource utilization, and transmission\nstrategy to enable UAM receiving C2 messages regardless of time and space.\nFirst, through stochastic geometry modeling, we analyze the signal blockage\neffects caused by the urban buildings. The blockage probability is calculated\naccording to the shape, height, and density of the buildings, and the coverage\nprobability of the received signal is derived by reflecting the blockage\nevents. Furthermore, the low-reliability area is identified by analyzing the\ncoverage performance according to the positions of the UAMs. To overcome the\nlow-reliability region, we propose three methods for UAM network operation: i)\noptimization of antennas elevation tilting, ii) frequency reuse with\nmulti-layered narrow beam, and iii) assistive transmissions by the master UAM.",

We show that pulse tails, controlling interactions, depend on\nthe dominant spatial eigenvalues, whose real part is closest to zero, with a\ntransition at $\\kappa_c>0$: below $\\kappa_c$, both dominant eigenvalues are\ncomplex, and the tails are oscillatory. Above $\\kappa_c$, the dominant spatial\neigenvalue with a positive real part becomes real, and the downslope tail\ntransitions from oscillatory to monotonic. Below $\\kappa_c$, bound states with\ndifferent numbers of pulses exist whose collisions are studied. Well above\n$\\kappa_c$, adjacent pulses repel each other, spreading out and becoming\nequispaced in the domain. A reduced model is proposed based on the interaction\nvia tails of adjacent pulses, reproducing the repulsion and collisions from\nDNS. The model shows that the transition from bound states to equidistant\nspreading occurs when the monotonic/oscillatory tails have the same slope. This\nstudy elucidates the motion of localized patterns in moderate-Rayleigh number\nconvection in an inclined porous layer with an imperfectly conducting boundary.",

However, current methods\nface several challenges: (1) Complex network designs hinder scalability to\nscenarios with more than two modalities. (2) Focusing solely on\nmodality-invariant representation while neglecting modality-specific features,\nleads to incomplete MM learning. (3) Leveraging unlabeled data with generative\nmethods can be unreliable for SSL. To address these problems, we propose Double\nBank Dual Consistency (DBDC), a novel MM-SSL approach for medical image\nsegmentation. To address challenge (1), we propose a modality all-in-one\nsegmentation network that accommodates data from any number of modalities,\nremoving the limitation on modality count. To address challenge (2), we design\ntwo learnable plug-in banks, Modality-Level Modulation bank (MLMB) and\nModality-Level Prototype (MLPB) bank, to capture both modality-invariant and\nmodality-specific knowledge. These banks are updated using our proposed\nModality Prototype Contrastive Learning (MPCL). Additionally, we design\nModality Adaptive Weighting (MAW) to dynamically adjust learning weights for\neach modality, ensuring balanced MM learning as different modalities learn at\ndifferent rates. Finally, to address challenge (3), we introduce a Dual\nConsistency (DC) strategy that enforces consistency at both the image and\nfeature levels without relying on generative methods.

Besides, lower-order exercise latent representations obtained in\nshallow layers are not well explored when learning the student representation.\nTo tackle the issues, this paper suggests a meta multigraph-assisted\ndisentangled graph learning framework for CD (DisenGCD), which learns three\ntypes of representations on three disentangled graphs: student-exercise-concept\ninteraction, exercise-concept relation, and concept dependency graphs,\nrespectively. Specifically, the latter two graphs are first disentangled from\nthe interaction graph. Then, the student representation is learned from the\ninteraction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning module; multiple\nlearnable propagation paths in this module enable current student latent\nrepresentation to access lower-order exercise latent representations, which can\nlead to more effective nad robust student representations learned; the exercise\nand concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency graphs\nby graph attention modules. Finally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to\nhandle three disentangled representations for prediction. Experiments show\nbetter performance and robustness of DisenGCD than state-of-the-art CD methods\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled learning framework and\nmeta multigraph module.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the role of two inert mono-atomic diluents, argon and\nhelium, on the detonation structure in order to assess the importance of\nvibrational non-equilibrium and wall losses. When relaxation effects and wall\nlosses are neglected, the detonation waves in mixtures diluted with either of\nthese gases have the same kinetics, Mach number, and specific heat ratio and\nhence are expected to lead to the same cellular dynamics. The experiments were\nconducted in 2H2/O2/7Ar and 2H2/O2/7He mixtures in a narrow channel. The\ninitial pressure was adjusted in such a way that the induction zone length\n(therefore cell sizes) calculated from the ideal ZND model remained constant.\nThe experiments revealed differences in velocity deficits and cell sizes\ndespite maintaining a constant induction zone length across the mixtures. Near\nthe detonation limits, the disparity in cell sizes between the two mixtures\nnearly doubled. We incorporated the boundary layer flow divergence in a\nperturbation analysis based on the square wave detonation assumption and\nestablished the controlling loss parameter as the product of the induction to\nchannel size and the inverse of the square root of the Reynolds number. The\nvery good collapse of the scaled results with the two bath gases with the loss\nparameter, and further comparison with 2D numerical simulations with account\nfor flow divergence to the third dimension, confirmed the viscous loss\nmechanism to be dominating. Calculations suggest that the slower relaxation of\nH2 becomes comparable with the ignition delay anticipated from the ZND model\nand is slower by 70% in the argon diluted system. Differences possibly\nhighlighting the role of non-equilibrium were not observed. This suggests the\nvibrational non-equilibrium effect may be less apparent in cellular detonations\ndue to the lengthening of the ignition delays owing to the non-steady\ndetonation structure.",

    "abstract": "Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) is emerging as a crucial role in AI\napplications. Unfortunately, EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks,\nhighlighting the urgent need for copyright protection. Although some\npreliminary works propose applying embedding watermarks to protect EaaS, recent\nresearch reveals that these watermarks can be easily removed. Hence, it is\ncrucial to inject robust watermarks resistant to watermark removal attacks.\nExisting watermarking methods typically inject a target embedding into\nembeddings through linear interpolation when the text contains triggers.\nHowever, this mechanism results in each watermarked embedding having the same\ncomponent, which makes the watermark easy to identify and eliminate. Motivated\nby this, in this paper, we propose a novel embedding-specific watermarking\n(ESpeW) mechanism to offer robust copyright protection for EaaS. Our approach\ninvolves injecting unique, yet readily identifiable watermarks into each\nembedding. Watermarks inserted by ESpeW are designed to maintain a significant\ndistance from one another and to avoid sharing common components, thus making\nit significantly more challenging to remove the watermarks. Moreover, ESpeW is\nminimally invasive, as it reduces the impact on embeddings to less than 1\\%,\nsetting a new milestone in watermarking for EaaS. Extensive experiments on four\npopular datasets demonstrate that ESpeW can even watermark successfully against\na highly aggressive removal strategy without sacrificing the quality of\nembeddings.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has achieved promising results on robotic control\ntasks but struggles to leverage information effectively from multiple sensory\nmodalities that differ in many characteristics. Recent works construct\nauxiliary losses based on reconstruction or mutual information to extract joint\nrepresentations from multiple sensory inputs to improve the sample efficiency\nand performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the\nrepresentations learned by these methods could capture information irrelevant\nto learning a policy and may degrade the performance. We argue that compressing\ninformation in the learned joint representations about raw multimodal\nobservations is helpful, and propose a multimodal information bottleneck model\nto learn task-relevant joint representations from egocentric images and\nproprioception. Our model compresses and retains the predictive information in\nmultimodal observations for learning a compressed joint representation, which\nfuses complementary information from visual and proprioceptive feedback and\nmeanwhile filters out task-irrelevant information in raw multimodal\nobservations. We propose to minimize the upper bound of our multimodal\ninformation bottleneck objective for computationally tractable optimization.\nExperimental evaluations on several challenging locomotion tasks with\negocentric images and proprioception show that our method achieves better\nsample efficiency and zero-shot robustness to unseen white noise than leading\nbaselines.

The transport conductance indicates that the extended-critical\ntransition resembles a metallic-insulating transition. Moreover, the Wigner\ndistributions show that the Wigner distribution of the extended wave function\nis localized in the momentum direction of the phase space, while that of the\ncritical wave function is sub-extended in the momentum direction of the phase\nspace. Based on the results of entanglement entropy, the extended-critical\ntransition is a thermodynamic phase transition because it is accompanied by\ndecreasing entropy. We engineer a quantum heat cycle engine with the\nextended-critical quasicrystal as the working medium, and find that there are\nrich working modes in the engine, such as quantum accelerator, quantum heater\nand quantum heat engine.\n  Importantly, the extended quasicrystals are more conducive to the realization\nof quantum heat engines, while the critical quasicrystals are more conducive to\nthe realization of quantum heaters.

Additionally, a decreasing\ntrend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with\nincreasing frequency was observed. The measured NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean\nvalues (as computed by 3GPP methods) are found to be consistently lower\ncompared to 3GPP model predictions.

The distribution correction estimation (DICE) family of\nestimators have advanced the state of the art in OPE by breaking the curse of\nhorizon. However, the major bottleneck of applying DICE estimators lies in the\ndifficulty of solving the saddle-point optimization involved, especially with\nneural network implementations. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by\nestablishing a linear representation of value function and stationary\ndistribution correction ratio, i.e., primal and dual variables in the DICE\nframework, using the spectral decomposition of the transition operator. Such\nprimal-dual representation not only bypasses the non-convex non-concave\noptimization in vanilla DICE, therefore enabling an computational efficient\nalgorithm, but also paves the way for more efficient utilization of historical\ndata. We highlight that our algorithm, SpectralDICE, is the first to leverage\nthe linear representation of primal-dual variables that is both computation and\nsample efficient, the performance of which is supported by a rigorous\ntheoretical sample complexity guarantee and a thorough empirical evaluation on\nvarious benchmarks.",

To analytically solve our problem, we consider two approximations,\nwhere the first is that the cosmological constant is very small (conical\napproximation), and the second is that the linear velocity of the rotating\nframe is much less than the speed of light (slow rotation regime). After\nsolving a second-order differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre\nequation, whose solutions are the generalized Laguerre polynomials.\nConsequently, we obtain the energy spectrum, which is quantized in terms of the\nradial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and depends on the\nangular frequency $\\omega$ (describes the DO), cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$\n(describes the external magnetic field), angular velocity $\\Omega$ (describes\nthe rotating frame), spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial\nparameter $u$ (describes the components of the spinor), effective rest mass\n$m_{eff}$ (describes the rest mass modified by the spin-rotation coupling), and\non a real parameter $\\sigma$ and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ (describes the\nBonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime).

Most existing OOD detection methods on graphs primarily\nfocus on identifying instances in test data domains caused by either semantic\nshifts (changes in data classes) or covariate shifts (changes in data\nfeatures), while leaving the simultaneous occurrence of both distribution\nshifts under-explored. In this work, we address both types of shifts\nsimultaneously and introduce a novel challenge for OOD detection on graphs:\ngraph-level semantic OOD detection under covariate shift. In this scenario,\nvariations between the training and test domains result from the concurrent\npresence of both covariate and semantic shifts, where only graphs associated\nwith unknown classes are identified as OOD samples (OODs). To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose a novel two-phase framework called Graph Disentangled\nDiffusion Augmentation (GDDA). The first phase focuses on disentangling graph\nrepresentations into domain-invariant semantic factors and domain-specific\nstyle factors. In the second phase, we introduce a novel\ndistribution-shift-controlled score-based generative diffusion model that\ngenerates latent factors outside the training semantic and style spaces.\nAdditionally, auxiliary pseudo-in-distribution (InD) and pseudo-OOD graph\nrepresentations are employed to enhance the effectiveness of the energy-based\nsemantic OOD detector.

    "abstract": "In cellular mobile networks, wireless channel quality (CQ) is a crucial\nfactor in determining communication performance and user's network experience.\nAccurately predicting CQ based on real environmental characteristics, specific\nbase station configurations and user trajectories can help network operators\noptimize base station deployment, improving coverage and capacity. The Received\nSignal Reference Power (RSRP) and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio\n(SINR) of user equipment (UE) are key indicators of CQ in wireless\ncommunication. However, existing researches have limitations in terms of\ngeneration accuracy. Regression methods such as statistical inference and\nrandom forests fail to effectively capture the unique characteristics of\nwireless environments; theoretical derivations relying on specific\ncommunication protocols lack generalization capability; data-driven machine\nlearning (ML) methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network often suffer\nfrom a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nphysics-informed diffusion models, which accurately generate RSRP and SINR at\nUE based on the wireless environment, base station configurations, and user\ntrajectories. The model adopts a modular and end-to-end design, employing a\nteacher-student framework to achieve knowledge distillation. This method\nintegrates expert knowledge into the training of diffusion models, enhancing\nboth the interpretability and accuracy, while also facilitating faster\nconvergence of the model parameters. Furthermore, it allows for self-adaptation\nin various scenarios through few-shot learning. This approach provides valuable\nguidance for optimizing base station deployment, predicting user network\nexperience, and building real-world simulators.",

To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a\nfinetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses.

Although modern\nreaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP,\nthe inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that\nproduce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and\nnon-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In\nthis work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate\nconditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of\nhierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing.

Despite growing interest of LLM\nunlearning, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning\nmethod designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent\nrelationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively\nexamined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact\nwith unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided\nLLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between\n'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM\ngeneration. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types\nof unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while\nmaintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight\nattribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the\ninterconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to\nforget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE\nboosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as\ngradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such\nas fictitious unlearning, malicious use prevention, and copyrighted information\nremoval, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our\nknowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and\npinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in\ncontrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight\nattribution techniques.",

Its\nquasi-stationary states with a lifetime diverging with the number of particles\nin the system. These states are characterized by homogeneous or non-homogeneous\nstructures in phase-space. There exists a phase-transition between these states\nthat have been traditionally characterized by the their mean magnetization.\nHowever, the magnetization also exhibits fluctuations in time around its mean\nvalue, that can be an indicator of the kind of quasi-stationary state. Thus, we\nwant to characterize the quasi-stationary states of the HMF model through the\ntime-series of the magnetization and its fluctuations through a measure of\ninformation, i.e. the permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.\nPermutation entropy is a measure for characterizing chaotic time series,\nespecially in the presence of dynamic and observational noise, as it is\ncomputationally and conceptually simple. For non-homogeneous states, the\npermutation entropy shows that the HMF model tends towards order, while the\nmagnetizacion fluctuations reveal reduced structures in time. On the contrary,\nhomogeneous states tend to disorder and the structures of the magnetization\nfluctuations increase as the initial magnetization is larger. In all the study\ncases of this thesis, the HMF model is characterized by low entropy values but\nthe highest possible complexity value. Thus, the HMF model can be described as\na chaotic, deterministic and intermitent system. This aligns with previous\nstudies of the model in the phase space. The results demonstrate that the HMF\nmodel can be understood and interpreted from the fluctuations of magnetization\nusing permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.",

This presents a problem that academic researchers have\ntried to solve over two decades and on which platforms expend a large amount of\nresources. Nevertheless, the prevalence of fake reviews is arguably higher than\never. To combat this, we collect a dataset of reviews for thousands of Amazon\nproducts and develop a general and highly accurate method for detecting fake\nreviews. A unique difference between previous datasets and ours is that we\ndirectly observe which sellers buy fake reviews. Thus, while prior research has\ntrained models using lab-generated reviews or proxies for fake reviews, we are\nable to train a model using actual fake reviews. We show that products that buy\nfake reviews are highly clustered in the product-reviewer network. Therefore,\nfeatures constructed from this network are highly predictive of which products\nbuy fake reviews. We show that our network-based approach is also successful at\ndetecting fake reviews even without ground truth data, as unsupervised\nclustering methods can accurately identify fake review buyers by identifying\nclusters of products that are closely connected in the network. While text or\nmetadata can be manipulated to evade detection, network-based features are more\ncostly to manipulate because these features result directly from the inherent\nlimitations of buying reviews from online review marketplaces, making our\ndetection approach more robust to manipulation.",

Existing graph augmentation methods\ndesigned to address the covariate shift often disentangle the stable and\nenvironmental features in the input space, and selectively perturb or mixup the\nenvironmental features. However, such perturbation-based methods heavily rely\non an accurate separation of stable and environmental features, and their\nexploration ability is confined to existing environmental features in the\ntraining distribution.

    "abstract": "Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic\nlifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In\ncontrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due\nto its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the\nconventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does\nnot rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently,\nthe conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask\nsupervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables\n3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D\nsegmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based\nmethods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model\nto introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For\nthe semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we\nconstruct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We\nthen use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training.\nAdditionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated\nby merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of\nPLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space\nand match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent\ninstance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both\nsegmentation quality and speed.",

Hence, this thesis\nseeks to bridge some gaps between model and user-centered explainability. We\ncreate an explanation ontology (EO) to represent literature-derived explanation\ntypes via their supporting components. We implement a knowledge-augmented\nquestion-answering (QA) pipeline to support contextual explanations in a\nclinical setting. Finally, we are implementing a system to combine explanations\nfrom different AI methods and data modalities. Within the EO, we can represent\nfifteen different explanation types, and we have tested these representations\nin six exemplar use cases. We find that knowledge augmentations improve the\nperformance of base large language models in the contextualized QA, and the\nperformance is variable across disease groups. In the same setting, clinicians\nalso indicated that they prefer to see actionability as one of the main foci in\nexplanations. In our explanations combination method, we plan to use similarity\nmetrics to determine the similarity of explanations in a chronic disease\ndetection setting. Overall, through this thesis, we design methods that can\nsupport knowledge-enabled explanations across different use cases, accounting\nfor the methods in today's AI era that can generate the supporting components\nof these explanations and domain knowledge sources that can enhance them.",

The specific relationship between\ngeometry and these degrees of freedom is unique for each theory, but it is not\npredetermined. Instead, it is derived from constraints and equations of motion,\nrelying on key aspects of the canonical formulation of gravity, such as\nstructure functions in Poisson brackets of constraints and covariance\nconditions. As shown in previous work, these new theories allow for two types\nof scalar matter coupling: (1) minimal coupling, where the matter equations of\nmotion mirror the Klein-Gordon equation on a curved emergent spacetime, and (2)\nnonminimal coupling, where the equations deviate from the Klein-Gordon form but\nstill respect covariance. Observable features, such as the quasinormal mode\nspectrum, can help distinguish between different couplings based on how well\ntheir predictions match the data. In this work, the spectra of scalar\nquasinormal modes for both minimal and nonminimal couplings are derived using\nthe third-order WKB approximation. Significant differences are found between\nthe two cases. Notably, the nonminimal coupling allows for vanishing real and\nimaginary frequency components, and even opposite-sign values for the imaginary\npart at sufficiently small mass scales, pointing to potential new physical\nimplications. Finally, the high-frequency QNM spectra in emergent modified\ngravity is identical to the classical result, up to an overall constant,\nsuggesting that the horizon area spectrum remains equispaced.",

We apply least-squares\ndeconvolution to all spectra to extract the average profiles with high\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for Doppler imaging. The surface maps of the K\nsubgiant show starspots widely distributed along latitude and longitude. A\nprominent, non-axisymmetric polar spot around phase 0 is revealed by all images\nwith sufficient phase coverage, which may be a stable feature on the K\ncomponent. The starspots evolve in a time scale of one month. We have\ndetermined the surface shear rate of the K component from the starspot maps\nreconstructed 10 days apart in 2017 Nov--Dec, through the cross-correlation\nmethod. The surface differential rotation parameters are $\\Omega_{eq} = 1.591\n\\pm 0.002$ rad d$^{-1}$ and $\\Delta \\Omega = 0.035 \\pm 0.003$ rad d$^{-1}$. The\nabsorption lines contributed from the tertiary component are detected in all\nLSD profiles of SZ Psc, and we measure the radial velocity of the binary system\nand the tertiary component to derive an elliptical orbit with a period of $1530\n\\pm 3$ days and a mass of $0.75 \\pm 0.06$ M$\\odot$ for the tertiary component.",

There has been increasing recognition that its etiology is\nrooted in part in the social contexts that mediate substance use and access;\nhowever, reliable statistical measures of social influence are lacking in the\nliterature. We use Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI) as a proxy for\nreal-life social networks across diverse spatial regions that help quantify\nsocial connectivity across different spatial units. This is a measure of the\nrelative probability of connections between localities that offers a unique\nlens to understand the effects of social networks on health outcomes. We use\nSCI to develop a variable, called \"deaths in social proximity\", to measure the\ninfluence of social networks on opioid overdose deaths (OODs) in US counties.\nOur results show a statistically significant effect size for deaths in social\nproximity on OODs in counties in the United States, controlling for spatial\nproximity, as well as demographic and clinical covariates. The effect size of\nstandardized deaths in social proximity in our cluster-robust linear regression\nmodel indicates that a one-standard-deviation increase, equal to 11.70 more\ndeaths per 100,000 population in the social proximity of ego counties in the\ncontiguous United States, is associated with thirteen more deaths per 100,000\npopulation in ego counties. To further validate our findings, we performed a\nseries of robustness checks using a network autocorrelation model to account\nfor social network effects, a spatial autocorrelation model to capture spatial\ndependencies, and a two-way fixed-effect model to control for unobserved\nspatial and time-invariant characteristics. These checks consistently provide\nstatistically robust evidence of positive social influence on OODs in US\ncounties.",

    "abstract": "Background: Full-field, quantitative visualization techniques, such as\ndigital image correlation (DIC), have unlocked vast opportunities for\nexperimental mechanics. However, DIC has traditionally been a surface\nmeasurement technique, and has not been extended to perform measurements on the\ninterior of specimens for dynamic, full-scale laboratory experiments. This\nrestricts the use of DIC measurements, especially in the context of\nheterogeneous materials. Objective: The focus of this study is to develop a\nmethod for performing internal DIC measurements in dynamic experiments. The aim\nis to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy across a range of stresses (up\nto 650MPa), strain rates ($10^3$-$10^6$ s$^{-1}$), and high-strain rate loading\nconditions (e.g., ramped and shock wave loading). Methods: Internal DIC is\ndeveloped based on the concept of applying a speckle pattern at an inner-plane\nof a transparent specimen. The high-speed imaging configuration is then focused\non the internal speckle pattern. During the dynamic experiment, in-plane,\ntwo-dimensional deformations are measured via correlation of the internal\nspeckle pattern. Results: The internal DIC experimental technique is\nsuccessfully demonstrated in both the SHPB and plate impact experiments. In the\nSHPB setting, the accuracy of the technique is excellent throughout the\ndeformation regime, with measurement noise of approximately 0.2% strain. For\nplate impact experiments, the technique performs well, with error and\nmeasurement noise of 1% strain. Conclusion: The internal DIC technique has been\ndeveloped and demonstrated to work well for full-scale dynamic high-strain rate\nand shock laboratory experiments, and the accuracy is quantified. The technique\ncan aid in investigating the physics and mechanics of the dynamic behavior of\nmaterials, including local deformation fields around dynamically loaded\nmaterial heterogeneities.",

This paper introduces X-Mobility, an\nend-to-end generalizable navigation model that overcomes existing challenges by\nleveraging three key ideas. First, X-Mobility employs an auto-regressive world\nmodeling architecture with a latent state space to capture world dynamics.\nSecond, a diverse set of multi-head decoders enables the model to learn a rich\nstate representation that correlates strongly with effective navigation skills.\nThird, by decoupling world modeling from action policy, our architecture can\ntrain effectively on a variety of data sources, both with and without expert\npolicies: off-policy data allows the model to learn world dynamics, while\non-policy data with supervisory control enables optimal action policy learning.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that X-Mobility not only\ngeneralizes effectively but also surpasses current state-of-the-art navigation\napproaches. Additionally, X-Mobility also achieves zero-shot Sim2Real\ntransferability and shows strong potential for cross-embodiment generalization.",

Limited annotations hinder the model's\nability to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. While data augmentation\ncan improve generalizability, unsupervised augmentation techniques must be\napplied carefully to avoid introducing noise. Unsupervised domain adaptation\n(UDA) addresses domain discrepancies by aligning conditional distributions with\nlabeled target samples, but vanilla pseudo-labeling can lead to error\npropagation. To address these challenges, we propose $\\mu$DAR, a novel joint\noptimization architecture comprised of three functions: (i) consistency\nregularizer between augmented samples to improve model classification\ngeneralizability, (ii) temporal ensemble for robust pseudo-label generation and\n(iii) conditional distribution alignment to improve domain generalizability.\nThe temporal ensemble works by aggregating predictions from past epochs to\nsmooth out noisy pseudo-label predictions, which are then used in the\nconditional distribution alignment module to minimize kernel-based class-wise\nconditional maximum mean discrepancy ($k$CMMD) between the source and target\nfeature space to learn a domain invariant embedding. The\nconsistency-regularized augmentations ensure that multiple augmentations of the\nsame sample share the same labels; this results in (a) strong generalization\nwith limited source domain samples and (b) consistent pseudo-label generation\nin target samples.

Using some standard results from model theory, we conclude that\nthe space of (equivalence classes of) pmp hypergraphs with the topology of\nlocal-global convergence is compact, and that any countable set of local\nstatistics for a pmp hypergraph can be realized as the statistics of a set of\nlabellings (rather than just approximated) in a local-global equivalent\nhypergraph.\n  We give two applications. First, we characterize those structures where any\nsolution to the corresponding CSP can be turned into a measurable solution.\nThese turn out to be the width-1 structures. We can also use the limit\nmachinery to extract from this theorem a purely finitary characterizations of\nwidth-1 structures involving asymptotic solutions.\n  Second, we prove two measurable versions of the Frankl--R\\\"odl matching\ntheorem using measurable nibble and differential equation arguments. The\nmeasurable proofs are much softer than the purely finitary results. And, we can\nrecover the finitary theorems using the limit machinery.",

    "abstract": "Inferences from adjective-noun combinations like \"Is artificial intelligence\nstill intelligence?\" provide a good test bed for LLMs' understanding of meaning\nand compositional generalization capability, since there are many combinations\nwhich are novel to both humans and LLMs but nevertheless elicit convergent\nhuman judgments. We study a range of LLMs and find that the largest models we\ntested are able to draw human-like inferences when the inference is determined\nby context and can generalize to unseen adjective-noun combinations. We also\npropose three methods to evaluate LLMs on these inferences out of context,\nwhere there is a distribution of human-like answers rather than a single\ncorrect answer. We find that LLMs show a human-like distribution on at most\n75\\% of our dataset, which is promising but still leaves room for improvement.",

    "abstract": "This essay examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming\nmore integral to international affairs by affecting how global governors exert\npower and pursue digital sovereignty. We first introduce a taxonomy of\nmultifaceted AI payoffs for governments and corporations related to\ninstrumental, structural, and discursive power in the domains of violence,\nmarkets, and rights. We next leverage different institutional and practice\nperspectives on sovereignty to assess how digital sovereignty is variously\nimplicated in AI-empowered global governance. States both seek sovereign\ncontrol over AI infrastructures in the institutional approach, while\nestablishing sovereign competence through AI infrastructures in the practice\napproach. Overall, we present the digital sovereignty stakes of AI as related\nto entanglements of public and private power. Rather than foreseeing technology\ncompanies as replacing states, we argue that AI systems will embed in global\ngovernance to create dueling dynamics of public/private cooperation and\ncontestation. We conclude with sketching future directions for IR research on\nAI and global governance.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims\nto identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for\nreduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known\nKolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent\nyears, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the\nlatent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable\nweighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable\nweighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting\nparameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either\ncollapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence\nbehavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a\nsharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments\non classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and\nforced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing\nmethods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques\n(e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant\nimprovements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE\nsystems.",

Here, we entertain\nthe possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be\nultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse\noccur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion.\nWe study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and\nstructure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting\nfrom the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed,\nearly-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity\ndependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the\nfavored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark\nmatter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a\nrelatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with\ndifferent velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best,\nself-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction,\ntypical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss\ncomplementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature,\nfocusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to\nexist in smaller galaxies.",
