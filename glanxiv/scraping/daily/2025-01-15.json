    "abstract": "Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have interesting properties and\nimportant applications in photonics. A particular class of BICs are found in\nFabry-Perot (FP) cavities formed by two parallel periodic dielectric layers\nseparated by a distance $h$. A periodic dielectric layer can totally reflect a\nplane incident wave with a particular frequency and a particular wavenumber.\nExisting FP-BICs are found when $h$ is close to the values deduced from a\nphase-matching condition related to the reflection coefficient, but they are\nobtained in FP-cavities where the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in\nthe periodic direction. In this paper, we further clarify the connection\nbetween total reflections and FP-BICs. Our numerical results indicate that if\nthe wavenumber is zero or the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the\nperiodic direction, FP-BICs can indeed be found near the parameters of total\nreflections. However, if the wavenumber is nonzero and the periodic layer is\nasymmetric (in the periodic direction), we are unable to find a FP-BIC (with a\nfrequency and a wavenumber near those of a total reflection) by tuning $h$ or\nother structural parameters. Consequently, a total reflection does not always\nlead to a FP-BIC even when the parameters of the FP-cavity are tuned.",

To enhance the accuracy and robustness of 3D\nreconstruction, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds were utilized\ntogether with image data and segmentation masks. By leveraging both image- and\nLiDAR-SLAM, we developed a multi-frame and multi-modal fusion framework that\nproduces dense, colorized point clouds, effectively capturing crack semantics\nat a 3D real-world scale. Furthermore, the crack geometric attributions were\nmeasured automatically and directly within 3D dense point cloud space,\nsurpassing the limitations of conventional 2D image-based measurements.

When dealing with high-dimensional covariates or when the\neffect modifiers are not predefined and need to be discovered, data-adaptive\nselection approaches become essential. However, with data-driven model\nselection, the quantification of statistical uncertainty is complicated by\npost-selection inference due to difficulties in approximating the sampling\ndistribution of the target estimator. Data-driven model selection tends to\nfavor models with strong effect modifiers with an associated cost of inflated\ntype I errors. Although several frameworks and methods for valid statistical\ninference have been proposed for ordinary least squares regression following\ndata-driven model selection, fewer options exist for valid inference for effect\nmodifier discovery in causal modeling contexts.

We address the computational\nchallenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using\ncluster expansion.

In this setup, measurement (output)\nuncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are\nemployed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown\ndistributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then\nintroduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory\ngeneration problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular\nmaps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with\nrespect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure,\nestimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of\nsystems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which\nthe observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized\ndynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\nrepresentative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based\nestimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware\nplanning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite\nemploys an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the\nrendezvous trajectory.",

This paper presents a novel\napproach to Software Quality and Privacy, in which testing companies can\nperform code analysis tasks on encrypted software code provided by software\ncompanies while code privacy is preserved. The approach combines Static Code\nAnalysis and Searchable Symmetric Encryption in order to process the source\ncode and build an encrypted inverted index that represents its data and control\nflows. The index is then used to discover vulnerabilities by carrying out\nstatic analysis tasks in a confidential way. With this approach, this paper\nalso defines a new research field -- Confidential Code Analysis --, from which\nother types of code analysis tasks and approaches can be derived. We\nimplemented the approach in a new tool called CoCoA and evaluated it\nexperimentally with synthetic and real PHP web applications.

In this work, we show that this task is\ntractable and present the first efficient algorithm to test various noise\nassumptions on the training data.\n  To model this question, we extend the recently proposed testable learning\nframework of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan (2023) and require a learner to run an\nassociated test that satisfies the following two conditions: (1) whenever the\ntest accepts, the learner outputs a classifier along with a certificate of\noptimality, and (2) the test must pass for any dataset drawn according to a\nspecified modeling assumption on both the marginal distribution and the noise\nmodel. We then consider the problem of learning halfspaces over Gaussian\nmarginals with Massart noise (where each label can be flipped with probability\nless than $1/2$ depending on the input features), and give a fully-polynomial\ntime testable learning algorithm.\n  We also show a separation between the classical setting of learning in the\npresence of structured noise and testable learning.

However, this ``cascading'' retrieve-and-rerank\napproach is limited by the bounded recall problem: relevant documents not\nretrieved initially are permanently excluded from the final ranking. Adaptive\nretrieval techniques address this problem, but do not work with listwise\nrerankers because they assume a document's score is computed independently from\nother documents. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of an existing\nadaptive retrieval method that supports the listwise setting and helps guide\nthe retrieval process itself (thereby overcoming the bounded recall problem for\nLLM rerankers). Specifically, our proposed algorithm merges results both from\nthe initial ranking and feedback documents provided by the most relevant\ndocuments seen up to that point. Through extensive experiments across diverse\nLLM rerankers, first stage retrievers, and feedback sources, we demonstrate\nthat our method can improve nDCG@10 by up to 13.23% and recall by 28.02%--all\nwhile keeping the total number of LLM inferences constant and overheads due to\nthe adaptive process minimal.

Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta\nusing detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly\nsynthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by\nthe high ejecta velocities $v \\gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum\npeaking around 1 MeV.

What\nsustains the stability and coexistence of species within these ecosystems?\nTraditional ecological models have largely been based on the assumption that\nspecies primarily engage in pairwise interactions. However, interactions in\necological systems may involve groups of three or more individuals, i.e.\nhigher-order interactions. As a result, the question of how the combined\neffects of pairwise and higher-order interactions shape the stability of large\necological communities remains unresolved.\n  This work addresses this gap by analyzing a model of competitive communities\nthat incorporates both pairwise and higher-order interactions. Using analytical\ntechniques and numerical simulations, we find that higher-order interactions\nalone are not always sufficient to foster and maintain coexistence. When\nspecies are identical (i.e., have the same physiological rates), even a small\nproportion of higher-order interactions can stabilize their dynamics. However,\nwhen more realistic factors, such as varied birth and death rates or complex\ninteraction structures are introduced, a finite fraction of higher-order\ninteractions may not be sufficient to achieve stable coexistence. Our findings\nchallenge the role of higher-order interactions as a universal stabilizing\nmechanism in ecological communities and open new avenues for research into the\ninterplay of different factors that underpin biodiversity and ecosystem\nstability.",

The Retention Layer\ndesign parallels social learning processes, encompassing attention, retention,\nreproduction, and motivation stages. Technically, it integrates a memory\nattention mechanism and episodic buffers to manage memory scalability, mitigate\noverfitting, and ensure efficient recall. Applications span adaptive personal\nassistants, real time fraud detection, autonomous robotics, content moderation,\nand healthcare diagnostics. In each domain, the retention mechanism enables\nsystems to learn incrementally, personalize outputs, and respond to evolving\nreal world challenges effectively. By emulating key aspects of human learning,\nthis retention enhanced architecture fosters a more fluid and responsive AI\nparadigm, paving the way for dynamic, session aware models that extend the\ncapabilities of traditional Transformers into domains requiring continual\nadaptation.",

    "abstract": "Canonical work handling distribution shifts typically necessitates an entire\ntarget distribution that lands inside the training distribution. However,\npractical scenarios often involve only a handful of target samples, potentially\nlying outside the training support, which requires the capability of\nextrapolation. In this work, we aim to provide a theoretical understanding of\nwhen extrapolation is possible and offer principled methods to achieve it\nwithout requiring an on-support target distribution. To this end, we formulate\nthe extrapolation problem with a latent-variable model that embodies the\nminimal change principle in causal mechanisms. Under this formulation, we cast\nthe extrapolation problem into a latent-variable identification problem. We\nprovide realistic conditions on shift properties and the estimation objectives\nthat lead to identification even when only one off-support target sample is\navailable, tackling the most challenging scenarios. Our theory reveals the\nintricate interplay between the underlying manifold's smoothness and the shift\nproperties. We showcase how our theoretical results inform the design of\npractical adaptation algorithms. Through experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world data, we validate our theoretical findings and their practical\nimplications.",

    "abstract": "Deformable image registration (DIR) is an enabling technology in many\ndiagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Despite this, DIR algorithms have limited\nclinical use, largely due to a lack of benchmark datasets for quality assurance\nduring development. To support future algorithm development, here we introduce\nour first-of-its-kind abdominal CT DIR benchmark dataset, comprising large\nnumbers of highly accurate landmark pairs on matching blood vessel\nbifurcations. Abdominal CT image pairs of 30 patients were acquired from\nseveral public repositories as well as the authors' institution with IRB\napproval. The two CTs of each pair were originally acquired for the same\npatient on different days. An image processing workflow was developed and\napplied to each image pair: 1) Abdominal organs were segmented with a deep\nlearning model, and image intensity within organ masks was overwritten. 2)\nMatching image patches were manually identified between two CTs of each image\npair 3) Vessel bifurcation landmarks were labeled on one image of each image\npatch pair. 4) Image patches were deformably registered, and landmarks were\nprojected onto the second image. 5) Landmark pair locations were refined\nmanually or with an automated process. This workflow resulted in 1895 total\nlandmark pairs, or 63 per case on average. Estimates of the landmark pair\naccuracy using digital phantoms were 0.7+/-1.2mm. The data is published in\nZenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14362785. Instructions for use can be\nfound at https://github.com/deshanyang/Abdominal-DIR-QA. This dataset is a\nfirst-of-its-kind for abdominal DIR validation. The number, accuracy, and\ndistribution of landmark pairs will allow for robust validation of DIR\nalgorithms with precision beyond what is currently available.",

Successfully implementing an error correction protocol requires\nthe fidelity of qubit operations to be well-above error correction thresholds.\nIn superconducting quantum computers, measurement of the qubit state remains\nthe lowest-fidelity operation. For the transmon, a prototypical superconducting\nqubit, measurement is carried out by scattering a microwave tone off the qubit.\nConventionally, the frequency of this tone is of the same order as the transmon\nfrequency. The measurement fidelity in this approach is limited by\nmulti-excitation resonances in the transmon spectrum which are activated at\nhigh readout power. These resonances excite the qubit outside of the\ncomputational basis, violating the desired quantum non-demolition character of\nthe measurement. Here, we find that strongly detuning the readout frequency\nfrom that of the transmon exponentially suppresses the strength of spurious\nmulti-excitation resonances. By increasing the readout frequency up to twelve\ntimes the transmon frequency, we achieve a quantum non-demolition measurement\nfidelity of 99.93% with a residual probability of leakage to non-computational\nstates of only 0.02%.",

    "abstract": "Current visual SLAM systems face significant challenges in balancing\ncomputational efficiency with robust loop closure handling. Traditional\napproaches require careful manual tuning and incur substantial computational\noverhead, while learning-based methods either lack explicit loop closure\ncapabilities or implement them through computationally expensive methods. We\npresent AutoLoop, a novel approach that combines automated curriculum learning\nwith efficient fine-tuning for visual SLAM systems. Our method employs a DDPG\n(Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to dynamically adjust loop closure\nweights during training, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter search\nwhile significantly reducing the required training steps. The approach\npre-computes potential loop closure pairs offline and leverages them through an\nagent-guided curriculum, allowing the model to adapt efficiently to new\nscenarios. Experiments conducted on TartanAir for training and validated across\nmultiple benchmarks including KITTI, EuRoC, ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D demonstrate\nthat AutoLoop achieves comparable or superior performance while reducing\ntraining time by an order of magnitude compared to traditional approaches.\nAutoLoop provides a practical solution for rapid adaptation of visual SLAM\nsystems, automating the weight tuning process that traditionally requires\nmultiple manual iterations.

Effective strategies are needed to stem this\nprogression. To help fulfill this need, we developed a novel absolute risk\nprediction model for cannabis use disorder (CUD) for adolescents or young\nadults who use cannabis. Methods: We trained a Bayesian machine learning model\nthat provides a personalized CUD absolute risk for adolescents or young adults\nwho use cannabis with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nto Adult Health. Model performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation\n(CV) with area under the curve (AUC) and ratio of the expected to observed\nnumber of cases (E/O). Independent validation of the final model was conducted\nusing two datasets. Results: The proposed model has five risk factors:\nbiological sex, delinquency, and scores on personality traits of\nconscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. For predicting CUD risk within\nfive years of first cannabis use, AUC values for the training dataset and two\nvalidation datasets were 0.68, 0.64, and 0.75, respectively, and E/O values\nwere 0.95, 0.98, and 1, respectively. This indicates good discrimination and\ncalibration performance of the model. Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed\nmodel can aid clinicians in assessing the risk of developing CUD among\nadolescents and young adults who use cannabis, enabling clinically appropriate\ninterventions.",

We consider loop quantized\nSchwarzschild black hole, in particular the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) model,\nand study the static response to external tidal fields of spin zero (scalar\nfield), spin one (vector field), and spin two (axial gravitational field)\ntypes. We find that, in contrast to the classical theory, where TLNs vanish,\nthey are non-vanishing and negative for all three responses and for all\nmultipoles. Besides, the magnitude of TLNs decreases as the black hole mass\nincreases, and TLNs, in response to the axial gravitational field, have the\nlargest magnitude among these three responses. Our results show that for black\nholes of mass $M \\gtrsim 4.3 \\times 10^{4} M_{\\textrm{Pl}}$, the AOS model is\nconsistent with current and next-generation detection limits for TLNs.

A significant body of literature exists, primarily\nfocusing on either RAI guidelines and principles or the technical aspects of\nRAI, largely within the realm of traditional AI. However, a notable gap\npersists in bridging theoretical frameworks with practical implementations in\nreal-world settings, as well as transitioning from RAI to Responsible\nGenerative AI (Gen AI). To bridge this gap, we present this article, which\nexamines the challenges and opportunities in implementing ethical, transparent,\nand accountable AI systems in the post-ChatGPT era, an era significantly shaped\nby Gen AI. Our analysis includes governance and technical frameworks, the\nexploration of explainable AI as the backbone to achieve RAI, key performance\nindicators in RAI, alignment of Gen AI benchmarks with governance frameworks,\nreviews of AI-ready test beds, and RAI applications across multiple sectors.\nAdditionally, we discuss challenges in RAI implementation and provide a\nphilosophical perspective on the future of RAI. This comprehensive article aims\nto offer an overview of RAI, providing valuable insights for researchers,\npolicymakers, users, and industry practitioners to develop and deploy AI\nsystems that benefit individuals and society while minimizing potential risks\nand societal impacts.

The infall region is largely insensitive to\nbaryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of\ncluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from\nthree publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectrsopic\nIdentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and\nSunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and\nclusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy\nImaging Survey.

Previous work demonstrated that\nwith rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph\nprogramming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity\nof imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a\nbounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper,\nwe overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated\nby the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present\nthree case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are\nconnected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the\nthird program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with\ninteger edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly\ndisconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs\nin time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of\nimperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we\nformally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime\nexperiments on various graph classes.",

Additionally, the impact of\nprompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context\nremains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands\nfor History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven\nindividual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the\nresults of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing\ncapabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e.,\nCode Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line\nPython bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically\nsignificant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by\nGitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves\nsubstantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual\nheuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and\n49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within\nthe context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style\nas the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and\nInstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix\nin terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off\nanalysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for\nthe practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios.",

Synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent\ntime-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination\nconditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR\ndata to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute\nresources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023,\nNASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis\n(OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR\nbackscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available,\nanalysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to\nsystematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often\nprohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer -\nwhich requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a\nper-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances\nwhen there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our\nmodel's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural\ndisasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three\ndifferent regions of the world.

In humans, this is evident in the ease with which\ncognate words - words similar in both orthographic form and meaning (e.g.,\nblind, meaning \"sightless\" in both English and German) - are processed,\ncompared to the challenges posed by interlingual homographs, which share\northographic form but differ in meaning (e.g., gift, meaning \"present\" in\nEnglish but \"poison\" in German). We investigate how multilingual Large Language\nModels (LLMs) handle such phenomena, focusing on English-Spanish,\nEnglish-French, and English-German cognates, non-cognate, and interlingual\nhomographs. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to disambiguate meanings\nand make semantic judgments, both when these word types are presented in\nisolation or within sentence contexts. Our findings reveal that while certain\nLLMs demonstrate strong performance in recognizing cognates and non-cognates in\nisolation, they exhibit significant difficulty in disambiguating interlingual\nhomographs, often performing below random baselines. This suggests LLMs tend to\nrely heavily on orthographic similarities rather than semantic understanding\nwhen interpreting interlingual homographs. Further, we find LLMs exhibit\ndifficulty in retrieving word meanings, with performance in isolative\ndisambiguation tasks having no correlation with semantic understanding.\nFinally, we study how the LLM processes interlingual homographs in incongruent\nsentences.

Our findings indicate that augmenting datasets with synthetic samples\nimproves classifier performance, with optimal results achieved at an 80%\nsynthetic to 20% human-coded data ratio. Lower temperature settings of 0.3,\ncorresponding to less variability in LLM generations, produced more stable\nimprovements but also limited model learning from augmented samples. In\ncontrast, higher temperature settings (0.7 and above) introduced greater\nvariability in performance estimates and, at times, lower performance.

Here we use the nanometer lateral resolution of\nnear-field photocurrent imaging to thoroughly characterize a buried monolayer -\nbilayer graphene interface as an ideal one dimensional defect for the Landauer\nresistivity dipole. Via systematic tuning of the overall charge carrier density\nand the current flow we are able to detect the formation of Landauer\nresistivity dipoles due to charge carrier accumulation around the one\ndimensional defects. We found that, for Fermi energy values near the charge\nneutrality point (i.e. at low hole or electron doping), the photocurrent\nexhibits the same polarity as the applied source-drain voltage, which is\nconsistent with changes in carrier concentration induced by the Landauer\nresistivity dipoles.

However, developing\nhigh-performance hardware circuits using HLS is still a non-trivial task\nrequiring expertise in hardware design. Further, the hardware design space,\nespecially for multi-kernel applications, grows exponentially. Therefore,\nseveral HLS automation and abstraction frameworks have been proposed recently,\nbut many issues remain unresolved. These issues include: 1) relying mainly on\nhardware directives (pragmas) to apply hardware optimizations without exploring\nloop scheduling opportunities. 2) targeting single-kernel applications only. 3)\nlacking automatic and/or global design space exploration. 4) missing critical\nhardware optimizations, such as graph-level pipelining for multi-kernel\napplications.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology and framework on\ntop of the popular multi-level intermediate representation (MLIR)\ninfrastructure called Stream-HLS. Our framework takes a C/C++ or PyTorch\nsoftware code and automatically generates an optimized dataflow architecture\nalong with host code for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To achieve\nthis, we developed an accurate analytical performance model for global\nscheduling and optimization of dataflow architectures. Stream-HLS is evaluated\nusing various standard HLS benchmarks and real-world benchmarks from\ntransformer models, convolution neural networks, and multilayer perceptrons.\nStream-HLS designs outperform the designs of prior state-of-the-art automation\nframeworks and manually-optimized designs of abstraction frameworks by up to\n$79.43\\times$ and $10.62\\times$ geometric means respectively.

Machine learning is now an established approach for\nphotometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance\nin areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over\ntemplate-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based\nconvolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude\nmodels. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design\ncomplexities: it is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different\ninstruments which have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis\nShrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using\ncutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated and the point\nestimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically\nconfirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2) and\ncatastrophic outlier rate ($\\eta$=17.53$\\%$). We find that early fusion\napproaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments)\nmatch the performance of late fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent\nspace representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the\nuser. Finally, we study how the models learn to use information across bands,\nfinding evidence that our models successfully incorporates information from all\nsurveys.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of communication technologies and the emergence of\nsixth-generation (6G) networks have introduced unprecedented opportunities for\nultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient communication. However, the\nintegration of advanced technologies like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)\nand wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) brings significant\nchallenges, particularly in terms of energy constraints and security\nvulnerabilities. Traditional antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access\nschemes struggle to meet the increasing demands for performance and security in\nsuch environments. To address this gap, this paper investigates the impact of\nemerging fluid antenna systems (FAS) on the performance of physical layer\nsecurity (PLS) in WPCNs. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a\ntransmitter, powered by a power beacon via an energy link, transmits\nconfidential messages to legitimate FAS-aided users over information links\nwhile an external eavesdropper attempts to decode the transmitted signals.\nAdditionally, users leverage the NOMA scheme, where the far user may also act\nas an internal eavesdropper. For the proposed model, we first derive the\ndistributions of the equivalent channels at each node and subsequently obtain\ncompact expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average\nsecrecy capacity (ASC), using the Gaussian quadrature methods. Our results\nreveal that incorporating the FAS for NOMA users, instead of the TAS, enhances\nthe performance of the proposed secure WPCN.",

    "abstract": "Vibrational polaritons, hybrid light-matter states formed between molecular\nvibrations and infrared (IR) cavity modes, provide a novel approach for\nmodifying chemical reaction pathways and energy transfer processes. For\nvibrational polaritons involving condensed-phase molecules, the short polariton\nlifetime raises debate over whether pumping polaritons may produce different\neffects on molecules compared to directly exciting the molecules in free space\nor under weak coupling. Here, for liquid methane under vibrational strong\ncoupling, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that pumping the\nupper polariton (UP) formed by the asymmetric bending mode of methane can\nsometimes selectively excite the IR-inactive symmetric bending mode. This\nfinding is validated when the molecular system is described using both\nempirical force fields and machine-learning potentials, also in qualitative\nagreement with analytical theory of polariton energy transfer rates based on\nFermi's golden rule calculations. Additionally, our study suggests that\npolariton-induced energy transfer to IR-inactive modes reaches maximal\nefficiency when the UP has significant contributions from both photons and\nmolecules, underscoring the importance of light-matter hybridization. As\nIR-inactive vibrational modes are generally inaccessible to direct IR\nexcitation, our study highlights the unique role of polariton formation in\nselectively controlling IR-inactive vibrations. Since this polariton-induced\nprocess occurs after the polariton decays, it may impact IR photochemistry on a\ntimescale longer than the polariton lifetime, as observed in experiments.",

We\ncompare our results to the semi-analytical code afterglowpy, finding a good\nagreement with our model except at early times off axis where the effects of\nbaryon loading are important. We compare electron cooling in the cases where\nthere is no IC cooling, Thomson cooling and an inclusion of Klein-Nishina\neffects, finding that the spectra can only be distinguished if the Compton\npotential is significantly increased. We obtain a similar cooling rate compared\nto semi-analytical solutions, with some small difference at the transition from\nIC to synchrotron dominated cooling.

    "abstract": "We study the classical scheduling problem of minimizing the makespan\n  of a set of unit size jobs with\n  precedence constraints on parallel identical machines. Research on the\nproblem dates back to the\n  landmark paper by Graham from 1966 who showed that the simple List\n  Scheduling algorithm is a $(2-\\frac{1}{m})$-approximation. Interestingly,\n  it is open whether the problem is NP-hard if $m=3$ which is one of\n  the few remaining open problems in the seminal book by Garey and Johnson.\n  Recently, quite some progress has been made for the setting that $m$\n  is a constant. In a break-through paper, Levey and Rothvoss presented\n  a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation with a running time of $n^{(\\log\nn)^{O((m^{2}/\\epsilon^{2})\\log\\log n)}}$[STOC\n  2016, SICOMP 2019] and this running time was improved to quasi-polynomial\n  by Garg[ICALP 2018] and to even $n^{O_{m,\\epsilon}(\\log^{3}\\log n)}$\n  by Li[SODA 2021]. These results use techniques like LP-hierarchies,\n  conditioning on certain well-selected jobs, and abstractions like\n  (partial) dyadic systems and virtually valid schedules.\n  In this paper, we present a QPTAS for the problem which is arguably\n  simpler than the previous algorithms. We just guess the positions\n  of certain jobs in the optimal solution, recurse on a set of guessed\n  subintervals, and fill in the remaining jobs with greedy routines.\n  We believe that also our analysis is more accessible, in particular since we\ndo not\n  use (LP-)hierarchies or abstractions of the problem like the ones above, but\nwe guess properties\n  of the optimal solution directly.",

For large nanostructures, these eigenvalue problems can be\ncomputationally intensive. One effective solution is a learning method via\nProper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), together with ab initio Galerkin\nprojection of the Schrodinger equation. POD-Galerkin projects the problem onto\na reduced-order space with the POD basis representing electron wave functions\n(WFs) guided by the first principles in simulations. To minimize training\neffort and enhance robustness of POD-Galerkin in larger structures, the quantum\nelement method (QEM) was proposed previously, which partitions nanostructures\ninto generic quantum elements. Larger nanostructures can then be constructed by\nthe trained generic quantum elements, each of which is represented by its\nPOD-Galerkin model. This work investigates QEM-Galerkin thoroughly in\nmulti-element quantum-dot (QD) structures on approaches to further improve\ntraining effectiveness and simulation accuracy and efficiency for QEM-Galerkin.\nTo further improve computing speed, POD and Fourier bases for periodic\npotentials are also examined in QEM-Galerkin simulations. Results indicate\nthat, considering efficiency and accuracy, the POD potential basis is superior\nto the Fourier potential basis even for periodic potentials. Overall,\nQEM-Galerkin offers more than a 2-order speedup in computation over direct\nnumerical simulation for multi-element QD structures, and more improvement is\nobserved in a structure comprising more elements.",

    "abstract": "A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a\nbiomolecular machine (e.g., a motor protein or an enzyme) in a nonequilibrium\nsteady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is\ncoupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy\nproduced along first-passage trajectories is no longer constant, resulting in a\nbreakdown of this expression. Here, we consider the canonical model for this\ntype of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme\ncatalysis (a type of continuous-time Markov process with relevance to\n$\\beta$-galactosidase and human glucokinase), as we explore this fluctuation\ntheorem in cooperative biomolecular networks. Kinetic evaluations are performed\nusing a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain\nsurprising and concise results from complex calculations. We find that in the\nabsence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be established for the\nfirst-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this\ndramatic reduction is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of\ncooperative networks. The validity of this expression can be experimentally\ntested, with its violation serving as a unique signature of hidden detailed\nbalance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression\nfor the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem,\nas well as the general form, revealing a thermodynamic bound on the kinetic\nbranching ratio (a measure of directionality defined as the ratio of the\nforward observable process probability to the backward one).

This technique is compatible with both human-based and\nautomatically generated salience estimates, allowing SIP-AT to be used as a\npart of human-driven model development without forcing SIP-AT to be reliant\nupon additional human data. We perform experiments across multiple datasets and\narchitectures and demonstrate that SIP-AT is able to boost the clean accuracy\nof models while maintaining a high degree of robustness against attacks at\nmultiple epsilon levels.

This framework allows for the analytical computation of energy and\ngradients with low-degree polynomial complexity, enabling the study of large\nproblems with thousands of spins. Concurrently, these states capture\nnon-trivial entanglement, crucial for the effectiveness of quantum annealing.\nWe benchmark the heuristic on the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model and\ncompare the solution quality and runtime of our method to other popular\nheuristics. Our findings suggest that it offers a scalable way to leverage\nquantum effects for complex optimization problems, potentially surpassing\nconventional alternatives in large-scale applications.",

By combining deep\nobservations at both low and high resolution, we recover the diffuse emission,\nresolve its structure, and measure the rotation curves from the inner region of\nthe galaxy to its outskirts using DysmalPy and 3DBarolo. Assuming that both\ngalaxies exhibit disk rotation driven by the gravitational potential of the\ngalaxy, we find that the best-fit disk models have a $V_{\\rm rot}/\\sigma\n\\approx 2$ and inferred circular velocities out to $\\sim$6-8 kpc scales, well\nbeyond the likely stellar distribution. We then determine the mass profiles of\neach component (stars, gas, dark matter) with priors on the baryon and dark\nmatter properties. We find relatively large dark matter fractions within their\neffective radii ($f_{\\rm DM}(R<R_e)$ = $0.61_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ and\n$0.53_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$, respectively), which are significantly larger than\nthose extrapolated from lower redshift studies and remain robust under\ndifferent input parameters verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. The large\n$f_{\\rm DM}(R<R_e)$ corresponds to halo masses of $\\sim 10^{12.5}-10^{12.8}\\,\nM_\\odot$, thus representative of the most massive halos at these redshifts.\nNotably, while the masses of these SMBHs are approximately 1 dex higher than\nthe low-redshift relationship with stellar mass, the closer alignment of SMBH\nand halo masses with a local relationship may indicate that the early formation\nof these SMBHs is linked to their dark matter halos, providing insights into\nthe co-evolution of galaxies and black holes in the early universe.",

The expected mass of the\nCepheid was below $3.5$ M$_\\odot$, which, if confirmed, would also probe the\nuncharted territory. The system configuration also pointed to the Cepheid as a\nmerger. We present a novel method for determining precise physical parameters\nof binary Cepheids using both theory and observations. This q-PED method\ncombines the measured mass ratio (q), pulsation (P), and evolutionary (E)\nmodels, and the known distance (D) supplemented with multi-band photometry.\nApplying it, we determined the mass of the Cepheid of $3.41 \\pm 0.08$\nM$_\\odot$, its radius of $13.65 \\pm 0.27$ R$_\\odot$, the companion mass of\n$1.89 \\pm 0.04$ M$_\\odot$ and radius of $12.51 \\pm 0.62$ R$_\\odot$. With the\ncurrent configuration, the apparent evolutionary age difference of almost 1 Gyr\nbetween the components strongly favors the Cepheid merger origin scenario. If\nso, the actual age of the Cepheid would be 1.09 Gyr, on the edge of Population\nII stars, indicating a significant fraction of Cepheids may be much older than\ntypically assumed. We also applied our method to an eclipsing binary Cepheid\nOGLE-LMC-CEP-1812 with accurately determined physical parameters, obtaining a\nclose agreement, which confirmed our method's reliability.",

Strong\nBalmer, Paschen, He I and He II emission lines are consistently observed in all\nspectra, while Brackett transitions and the Bowen blend are only prominent in\nthe soft state. Although P-Cygni profiles are not identified, the presence of\nwind signatures, such as extended emission wings, flat-top and asymmetric\nred-skewed profiles, is consistently observed through most emission lines,\nsuggesting the presence of wind-type ejecta. These features are particularly\nevident in the hard state, but they are also observed in the soft state,\nespecially in the near-infrared. This strengthens the case for\nstate-independent winds in black hole transients and increases the evidence for\nwind signatures in low-to-intermediate orbital inclination systems. We also\nstudy the spectral energy distribution, which provides evidence for the\npresence of synchrotron emission during the hard state. The jet significantly\naffects the near-infrared continuum, greatly diluting the emission features\nproduced in the accretion flow.

In this study, we\nconsider the opposite scenario and use muons produced in the forward direction\nto produce new muonphilic scalars, which can then be searched for at the FASER\ndetector. To minimize the backgrounds for this search, we make use of an\nupgraded preshower component, which is expected to be installed at FASER before\nthe end of Run 3, and is capable of spatially resolving two energetic photons.\nWe find that FASER, and its upgrade, FASER2 can probe currently unconstrained\nregions of parameter space, including regions that can potentially explain the\n$(g-2)_{\\mu}$ anomaly.

Despite the success of diffusion\nmodels in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far\nthey overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation\nprocess due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group\noffers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an\naccurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based\ndiffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for\nrealizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization\ngroup procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data\ninformation from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through\nreversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate\nhigh-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of\nthe model through applications to protein structure prediction and image\ngeneration. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models\nacross standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or\naccelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method\nalleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the\ngenerative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing\nsample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.",

We show that these disks, which are randomly oriented relative to\nthe binary orbital plane after the initial disruption of the star, can be\nreoriented by strong tidal torques in the binary near pericenter passages.\nFollowing accretion by the BHs on longer timescales, BBHs with small but\npreferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\\chi_{\\rm eff} \\lesssim\n0.2$) are formed. Our results indicate that BBH collisions in young massive\nstar clusters could contribute to the observed trend toward small positive\n$\\chi_{\\rm eff}$, and we suggest that the standard assumption often made that\ndynamically assembled BBHs should have isotropically distributed BH spins is\nnot always justified.",

We uniformly modelled interferometric visibilities for the\nentire sample to obtain the basic spatial properties of each belt, and combined\nthese with constraints from multi-wavelength photometry. We report key findings\nfrom a first exploration of this legacy dataset: (1) Belt dust masses are\ndepleted over time in a radially dependent way, with dust being depleted faster\nin smaller belts, as predicted by collisional evolution. (2) Most belts are\nbroad discs rather than narrow rings, with much broader fractional widths than\nrings in protoplanetary discs. We link broad belts to either unresolved\nsubstructure or broad planetesimal discs produced if protoplanetary rings\nmigrate. (3) The vertical aspect ratios (h = H/R) of 24 belts indicate orbital\ninclinations of 1-20 degrees, implying relative particle velocities of 0.1-4\nkm/s, and no clear evolution of heights with system age. This could be\nexplained by early stirring within the belt by large bodies (with sizes of at\nleast 140 km to the size of the Moon), by inheritance of inclinations from the\nprotoplanetary disc stage, or by a diversity in evolutionary pathways and\ngravitational stirring mechanisms.

This technique maintains a queue of video\nframes with progressively increasing noise, continuously producing clean frames\nat the queue's head while Gaussian noise is enqueued at the tail. However,\nFIFO-Diffusion often struggles to keep long-range temporal consistency in the\ngenerated videos due to the lack of correspondence modeling across frames. In\nthis paper, we propose Ouroboros-Diffusion, a novel video denoising framework\ndesigned to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling the\ngeneration of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introduce\na new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve structural\nconsistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhance\nsubject consistency, we devise a Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA)\nmechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achieve\nbetter visual coherence. Furthermore, we introduce self-recurrent guidance.\nThis technique leverages information from all previous cleaner frames at the\nfront of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the end,\nfostering rich and contextual global information interaction.

Results. Our\ncombined-modeling approach leads to an age estimation of the binary system KIC\n9163796 of 2.44$^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$ Gyr, which corresponds to a relative error in\nthe age of 9 %.

The hardening timescale is shorter for higher ambient gas\ndensities. Formed triple systems can be hardened reliably by $2-3$ orders of\nmagnitude relative to the initial binary semi-major axis within less than a few\nAGN orbits, limited only by our resolution. We calculate that the gas hardening\nof the triple enhances the probability for a merger by a minimum factor of\n$3.5-8$ depending on our assumptions. In several cases, two of the black holes\ncan execute periapses on the order of less than $10$ Schwarzschild radii, where\nthe dynamics were fully resolved for previous close approaches. The likelihood\nof these prompt mergers increases when the gas density is larger. Our results\nsuggest that current timescale estimates (without gas drag) for binary-single\ninduced mergers are an upper bound. The shrinkage of the triple by gas has the\nprospect of increasing the chance for unique GW phenomena such as residual\neccentricity, dephasing from a third object and double GW mergers.",

In this paper, we focus on understanding\nif this is the case when one generates images related to various software\nengineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is not\nimmune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by the\nuse of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificially\ngenerated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically,\nwe perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity bias\nexposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popular\nopen-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. We\nobtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describing\ndifferent software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineer\nkeyword, and one set does not include any specification of the person\nperforming the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities in\nthe generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biased\ntowards male figures when representing software engineers.

    "abstract": "The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the\ncreation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic\nimpact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful\nlevel - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic\nsensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process\nextending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current\ncomputational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex\nprocess by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs\n(MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis\nreveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations\nduring aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and\nunsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these\nhallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective\nreasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs\nprompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning\nthat aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have\ndirect applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for\nimage generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems\nthat can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with\nhuman aesthetic values.

    "abstract": "The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force\nFields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable\ntraining to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF\nFMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods,\nthere is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while\nresearch is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer\nacross chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of\nsystems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs\nrelevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical\nsoundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce\na method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation\nmodels to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical\nspace. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where\nthe smaller \"student\" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy\npredictions of the \"teacher\" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up\nto 20 $\\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and\nin some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We\nalso show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force\nparameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e.,\ncomputed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the\nrepresentations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while\nmaintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics\nsimulations.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly\nwidespread, concerns about content safety have grown in parallel. Currently,\nthere is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that address\nthe full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercial\napplications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptable\ntaxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into 12 top-level hazard\ncategories with an extension to 9 fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy is\ndesigned to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering more\ngranular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybrid\ndata generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM\n\"jury\" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis 2.0, a\ncarefully curated collection of 34,248 samples of human-LLM interactions,\nannotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, we\ndemonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficient\ntechniques on Aegis 2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safety\nmodels fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. In addition,\nwe introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic following\ndata.This approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them to\ngeneralize to new risk categories defined during inference. We plan to\nopen-source Aegis 2.0 data and models to the research community to aid in the\nsafety guardrailing of LLMs.",

Using\na theory-agnostic ansatz for the effective metric described by the\nRezzolla-Zhidenko metric and evolving perturbations on that background, we\nquantify with Bayesian analysis what regions of the effective spacetime could\nbe constrained in experiments. In contrast to standard ringdown analyses based\non quasi-normal mode extraction, a laboratory-controlled setup, in combination\nwith our framework, allows one to model the entire signal, including the prompt\nresponse and possible effects of late-time tails. Therefore, it has the\nintriguing advantage of not relying on start and end times when the\nsuperposition of quasi-normal modes is a good signal approximation. It also\navoids the non-trivial question of how many modes are present. We demonstrate\nthat this approach is feasible in principle and discuss opportunities beyond\nthis study.",

The optimal network is defined by channel\nradii that minimise the sum of viscous dissipation and the volumetric energetic\ncost of the fluid. For limit cases including laminar flows, high Reynolds\nnumber turbulence, or smooth channel approximations, optimal solutions are\nknown. However, no single optimisation approach captures these limit cases.\nFurthermore, realistic fluidic networks exhibit intermediate points in the\nparameter space that can hardly be optimised. Here, we present a unifying\noptimisation approach based on the Darcy friction factor, which has been\ndetermined for a wide range of flow regimes and fluid models. We optimise\nfluidic networks for the entire parameter space: Laminar and turbulent flows,\nincluding networks that exhibit both flow types; Non-Newtonian fluid models\n(power-law, Bingham, and Herschel-Bulkley); and Networks with arbitrary wall\nroughness, including non-uniform relative roughness. The optimal channel radii\nare presented analytically and graphically. Finally, the parameter $x$ in the\noptimisation relationship $Q\\propto R^x$ was approximated as a function of the\nReynolds number, revealing that previously-determined values of $x$ hardly\napply to realistic turbulent flows. Our approach can be extended to other\nconfigurations for which the friction factor is known, such as different\nchannel curvatures or wall slip conditions, enabling optimisation of a wide\nrange of fluidic networks.",

Relative to the grain sizes, the voids can be voluminous with three\ncomparable large extensions, narrow expansive with two comparable large\nextensions and one smaller extension, and thin long with one comparable large\nextension and two smaller extensions. The widely used representation of void\nspaces by systems of spheres connected by cylinders (pore network models) is an\nacceptable approximation for some special cases, but not for most porous and\nfractured media. We propose a flexible method for modelling such media by\nmapping their measured fabric's characteristics - void and grain volume\ndistributions and shapes - onto polyhedral tessellations of space. The map\nassigns voluminous voids and grains to polyhedrons (3D), narrow expansive voids\nto some polyhedral faces (2D), and thin long voids to some polyhedral edges\n(1D), as dictated by experimental data. The analysis of transport through such\ndiscrete structures with components of different dimensions is performed by a\nnovel mathematical method, which uses combinatorial differential forms to\nrepresent physical properties and their fluxes, as well as structure-preserving\noperators on such forms to formulate the conservation laws exactly and directly\nin matrix form, ready for computation.

The method is based on analyzing structures in the\npopulation-level distribution of tidal decay times, defined as the time\nremaining before a planet spirals into its host star due to stellar tides.\nUsing simple synthetic planet population simulations and analytic theory, we\nshow that there exists a steady-state portion of the decay time distribution\nwith an approximately power-law form. This steady-state feature is clearly\nevident in the decay time distribution of the observed short-period planet\npopulation.

    "abstract": "Kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) integrates traditional linear algorithms with\nkernel methods to generate nonlinear solutions in the input space. The standard\napproach relies on the representer theorem and the kernel trick to perform\npairwise evaluations of a kernel function in place of the inner product, which\nleads to scalability issues for large datasets due to its linear and\nsuperlinear growth with respect to the size of the training data. Explicit\nfeatures have been proposed to tackle this problem, exploiting the properties\nof the Gaussian-type kernel functions. These approximation methods address the\nimplicitness and infinite dimensional representation of conventional kernel\nmethods. However, achieving an accurate finite approximation for the kernel\nevaluation requires a sufficiently large vector representation for the dot\nproducts. An increase in the input-space dimension leads to a combinatorial\nexplosion in the dimensionality of the explicit space, i.e., it trades one\ndimensionality problem (implicit, infinite dimensional RKHS) for another (curse\nof dimensionality). This paper introduces a construction that simultaneously\nsolves these two problems in a principled way, by providing an explicit\nEuclidean representation of the RKHS while reducing its dimensionality. We\npresent SPEctral Eigenfunction Decomposition (SPEED) along with an efficient\nincremental approach for fast calculation of the dominant kernel eigenbasis,\nwhich enables us to track the kernel eigenspace dynamically for adaptive\nfiltering. Simulation results on chaotic time series prediction demonstrate\nthis novel construction outperforms existing explicit kernel features with\ngreater efficiency.",

Experimentally\nrealizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D\nnanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi\nsea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in\nnanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by\ndeveloping a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi\nsurface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden\nby quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the\nnanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological\ntransitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either,\nfirst, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane\northogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are\nreflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the\nelectronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed.\nAlso, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the\ngeometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are\nthen used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature\nof nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$\nvaries non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a\nprominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the\nother, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square\ntoroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases\nmonotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is\njust one topological transition.",

Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D\nscenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects\nlike buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in\nurban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a\ncompositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded\n4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic\nobjects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2)\nall objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural\nfields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose\nTraffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic\ntraffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV\nrepresentation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented\nand instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and\nvehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and\ninstances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and\nperiodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we\noffer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM,\nGoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world\ncity layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver\nlarge-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations.\nLeveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of\ndownstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban\nsimulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating\nrealistic 4D cities.",

The Provider\nDocumentation Summarization Quality Instrument (PDSQI-9) was developed to\nevaluate LLM-generated clinical summaries. Multi-document summaries were\ngenerated from real-world EHR data across multiple specialties using several\nLLMs (GPT-4o, Mixtral 8x7b, and Llama 3-8b). Validation included Pearson\ncorrelation for substantive validity, factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha for\nstructural validity, inter-rater reliability (ICC and Krippendorff's alpha) for\ngeneralizability, a semi-Delphi process for content validity, and comparisons\nof high-versus low-quality summaries for discriminant validity. Seven physician\nraters evaluated 779 summaries and answered 8,329 questions, achieving over 80%\npower for inter-rater reliability. The PDSQI-9 demonstrated strong internal\nconsistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.879; 95% CI: 0.867-0.891) and high\ninter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.867; 95% CI: 0.867-0.868), supporting\nstructural validity and generalizability. Factor analysis identified a 4-factor\nmodel explaining 58% of the variance, representing organization, clarity,\naccuracy, and utility. Substantive validity was supported by correlations\nbetween note length and scores for Succinct (rho = -0.200, p = 0.029) and\nOrganized ($\\rho = -0.190$, $p = 0.037$). Discriminant validity distinguished\nhigh- from low-quality summaries ($p < 0.001$). The PDSQI-9 demonstrates robust\nconstruct validity, supporting its use in clinical practice to evaluate\nLLM-generated summaries and facilitate safer integration of LLMs into\nhealthcare workflows.",

Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the\nnodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking\nwhen the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth).

Traditionally, addressing this challenge has\ninvolved either seeking trusted intermediaries or constructing cryptographic\nprotocols that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party\ncomputations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been\nmade in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the\nsize and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we\nargue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of a trusted\nthird party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were\npreviously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model\nEnvironments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation,\nwhere capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output\nconstraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness.\nThis approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and computational\nefficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions\nare currently infeasible.

The\nfraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high\nredshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to\ndraw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential\nobservational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses\nfor Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found\ntwo Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined,\ndense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter\nfrequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at\nhigh redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy\nextinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high\nredshifts.

    "abstract": "Various microphysical models attempt to explain the occurrence of broad\ndroplet size distributions (DSD) in clouds through approximate representations\nof the stochastic droplet growth by condensation in a turbulent environment.\nThis work analyzes specific idealized models, where the variability of droplet\ngrowth conditions arises primarily from variability in the turbulent vertical\nvelocity of the air carrying these droplets. Examples are the stochastic eddy\nhopping model operating in adiabatic parcels and certain types of DNS-like\nmodels. We show that such models produce droplet size statistics that are\nspatially inhomogeneous along the vertical direction, causing the predicted DSD\nto depend on the DSD spatial sampling scale $\\Delta$. In these models, $\\Delta$\nis implicitly related to the spatial extent of the droplets turbulent diffusion\n(approximated by Brownian-like excursions) and thus grows like $t^{1/2}$. This\nleads to spurious continuous DSD broadening, as the growth in time (also like\n$t^{1/2}$) of the standard deviation of droplet squared radius arises\nessentially from the growth of the sampling scale $\\Delta$. Also, the DSDs\npredicted by the models discussed here are not necessarily locally broad (in\nthe sense that large and small droplets might not be well-mixed in sufficiently\nsmall volumes) and thus do not necessarily indicate enhanced probabilities of\ngravity-induced droplet coagulation. In the effort to build a firm physical\nbasis for subgrid parametrizations, this study presents a framework to explain\nthe merits and limitations of idealized models, indicating how to assess and\nuse them wisely as a subgrid representation of turbulent condensation in\nlarge-eddy simulations of clouds.",

Previous works have estimated the neutrino emission\nfrom PWNe using various source catalogs measured in gamma-rays. However, such\nresults rely on the sensitivity of TeV gamma-ray observations and may omit the\ncontribution by unresolved sources. Here we estimate the potential neutrino\nemission from a synthetic population of PWNe in the Galaxy with a focus on the\nones that are still in the free expansion phase. In the calculation, we model\nthe temporal evolution of the free-expanding PWNe and consider the transport of\nprotons inside the PWNe. The Crab nebula is treated as a standard template for\nyoung PWNe to evaluate some model parameters, such as the energy conversion\nfraction of relativistic protons and the target gas density for the hadronic\nprocess, which are relevant to neutrino production. In the optimistic case, the\nneutrino flux from the simulated young PWNe may constitute to 5% of the\nmeasured flux by IceCube around 100 TeV.

The damping parameters, decrease\nas the Co content is increased, except for Co31Fe69. The smallest values of\ndamping correspond to alloys exhibiting interface perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy. A value of 0.00091 was measured for Co36Fe64, whereas for Co31Fe69\nwas measured as 0.002, this composition exhibits the largest in-plane\nanisotropy. HAADF-STEM cross-section analysis of the Co36Fe64 thin film stack\nrevealed Cu interdiffusion into the magnetic layer. The degree of\ninterdiffusion was found to be up to 7x higher at grain boundaries as compared\nthe bulk of the polycrystalline grains. The incorporation of Cu into the\nferromagnetic layer adversely impacts magnetic damping. Reducing impurities in\nthe magnetic layer by improving the growth chamber base pressure resulted in a\nreduction of magnetic damping of 18%. The diffraction analysis revealed that\nthe primary growth direction of Co36Fe64 is [101] and that of Cu buffer layer\nis [111], these planes are perpendicular to their respective [101] planes and\nfor this composition the lattice mismatch was determined to be 0.9325%. The\nlattice mismatch decreases with increasing Co content and hence the lattice\nstrain. The diffusion of Cu into the ferromagnet creates magnon scattering\ncenters and local changes in magnetic properties. Both factors negatively\ninfluence magnetic damping.",

    "abstract": "We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis\nfor Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the\nfollowing. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring\nspecific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API\ncalls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze\nwhether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To\nthis end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We\nsubsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential\ndependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing\nsink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and\nargue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but\nalso indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that\nneed to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call\nand used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary\nprivileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security\ntests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential\nbroken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really\noccur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The\napplication illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types\nof broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may\nnot be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able\nto do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to\naccess/manipulate information that they should not.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safe separation between aircraft is a critical challenge in air\ntraffic management, particularly in urban air mobility (UAM) environments where\nhigh traffic density and low altitudes require precise control. In these\nenvironments, conflicts often arise at the intersections of flight corridors,\nposing significant risks. We propose a tactical separation approach leveraging\nshared scheduling protocols, originally designed for Ethernet networks and\noperating systems, to coordinate access to these intersections. Using a\ndecentralized Markov decision process framework, the proposed approach enables\naircraft to autonomously adjust their speed and timing as they navigate these\ncritical areas, maintaining safe separation without a central controller. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated UAM scenarios,\ndemonstrating its ability to reduce separation violations to zero while\nacknowledging trade-offs in flight times as traffic density increases.\nAdditionally, we explore the impact of non-compliant aircraft, showing that\nwhile shared scheduling protocols can no longer guarantee safe separation, they\nstill provide significant improvements over systems without scheduling\nprotocols.",

This paper\naddresses the scheduling of medical interpreting services under uncertainty.\nThe problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model that\naccounts for uncertainties in emergency patients' arrival and service time. The\nmodel handles the hiring decisions of part-time interpreters and the assignment\nof full-time and hired part-time interpreters. The objective is to minimize the\ntotal cost, which encompasses full-time interpreters' overtime cost, the fixed\nand variable costs of part-time interpreters, and the penalty cost for not\nserving LEP patients on time. The model is solved using the Sample Average\nApproximation (SAA) algorithm. To overcome the computational burden of the SAA\nalgorithm, a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm was used to solve the model. A\nreal-life case study is used to validate and evaluate the proposed solution\nalgorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nstochastic programming-based solutions in concurrently reducing both the total\ncost and the waiting time. Further, sensitivity analysis reveals how the\nincrease in some key parameters, such as the arrival rate of emergency patients\nwith LEP, impacts scheduling outcomes.",

Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes\nto partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable\nstates of interest. In this work, we have developed a new \"binless\" WE\nsimulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures.\nOur proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE\nsimulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new\nalgorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b\nTrp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding\ntimes spanning the range between 3 and 40 {\\mu}s using projections along\npredefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors\nas CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good\naccuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation\ntime than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the\nCVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear\nCVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for\nresampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated\nnonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.",

Therefore, capturing and controlling the evolution of the melt pool is\ncrucial for enhancing process stability and part quality. In this study, we\ndeveloped a framework to support decision-making towards efficient AM process\noperations, capable of facilitating quality control and minimizing defects via\nmachine learning (ML) and polynomial symbolic regression models. We implemented\nexperimentally validated computational tools, specifically for laser powder bed\nfusion (LPBF) processes as a cost-effective approach to collect large datasets.\nFor a dataset consisting of 281 varying process conditions, parameters such as\nmelt pool dimensions (length, width, depth), melt pool geometry (area, volume),\nand volume indicated as spatter were extracted. Using machine learning (ML) and\npolynomial symbolic regression models, a high R2 of over 95 % was achieved in\npredicting the melt pool dimensions and geometry features on both the training\nand testing datasets, with either process conditions (power and velocity) or\nmelt pool dimensions as the model inputs.

Recently, machine\nlearning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding\ninformation from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data\nstream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by\nintegrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition,\nand ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine\nlocal structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements\nand edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese\ncobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries,\nincluding those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample\nmaterial system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from\nlithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental\ndata.

    "abstract": "In this work we investigate, through a Bayesian study, the ability of a local\nlow matter density $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, in discrepancy with the value usually\ninferred from the CMB angular power spectrum, to accommodate observations from\nlocal probes without being in tension with the local values of the Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ or the matter fluctuation $\\sigma_8$ parameters. For that, we\ncombine multiple local probes, with the criteria that they either can constrain\nthe matter density parameter independently from the CMB constraints, or can\nhelp in doing so after making their relevant observations more model\nindependent by relaxing their relevant calibration parameters. We assume\nhowever, either a dynamical dark energy model, or the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel, when computing the corresponding theoretical observables. We also add,\nin almost all of our Monte Carlo runs, the latest Baryonic acoustic\noscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI year one release to our core\ngroup. We found that, within $\\Lambda$CDM model, for different combinations of\nour probes, we can accommodate a low matter density along with the $H_0$ and\n$\\sigma_8$ values usually obtained from local probes, providing we promote the\nsound drag $r_s$ component in BAO calculations to a free parameter, and that\neven if we combine with the Pantheon+ Supernova sample. Assuming $w_0w_a$CDM,\nwe also found that relaxing $r_s$ allow us to accommodate $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$,\n$H_0$ and $\\sigma_8$ within their local values, with still however a preference\nfor $w_0w_a$ values far from $\\Lambda$CDM. However, when including Pantheon+\nSupernova sample, we found that the latter preference for high matter density\npushes $\\sigma_8$ to much smaller values, mitigating by then a low matter\ndensity solution to the two common tensions. We conclude that a low matter\ndensity value, helps in preserving the concordance within $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n(abridged)",

The augmented BiLSTM architecture facilitates accurate\nshort-term predictions for wind power. In addition, a ConvGAN-driven step for\nstochastic scenario generation and a hierarchical, multi-stage optimization\nframework, which includes cases with and without Battery Energy Storage (BES),\nsignificantly minimizes operational costs. The inclusion of DDM strategically\nalters network reactances, thereby obfuscating the system's operational\nparameters to deter cyber threats.

In the regime where the mechanical\nresonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared\nto the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum\nelectromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a\nhigh-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly\nnon-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead\nto a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator.

Because on the one hand, the population is increasing, and on\nthe other hand, the amount of food crop production is decreasing due to the\nattack of diseases. Rice is one of the most significant cultivated crops since\nit provides food for more than half of the world's population.

Automated driving systems (ADS) and other occupant\ncompartment advancements are expected to offer enhanced flexibility in seating\norientation, which could place a greater reliance on the seatbelt to restrain\noccupants. Such changes may increase seatbelt loads and create new challenges\nin successfully restraining occupants and mitigating injury to areas such as\nthe pelvis. Injury criteria exist for component-level male iliac wing fractures\nresulting from frontal lap belt loading, but not for females. Methods: This\nstudy explored female iliac wing fracture tolerance in the same loading\nenvironment as a previous study that explored the fracture tolerance of\nisolated male iliac wings. Male and female fracture data were combined to\nevaluate the effect of sex. Injury risk functions were created by fitting\nWeibull survival models to data that integrated censored and exact failure\nobservations. Results: Twenty female iliac wings were tested; fourteen of them\nsustained fracture with known failure forces (exact), but the remaining six\nwings either (1) did not fracture, or (2) fractured after an event that changed\nthe boundary conditions (right censored). The fracture tolerance of the tested\nspecimens ranged widely (1134 - 8759 N) and averaged 4240 N (SD 2516 N).\nConclusion: Female data and combined male-female data were analyzed.

Previously,\ncardiac scans included approximately 2/3 of the total lung volume with 5-6x\ngreater slice thickness than high-resolution (HR) full-lung (FL) CT. In this\nstudy, we present a novel attention-based Multi-view Swin Transformer to infer\nFL ALR values from segmented cardiac CT scans. For the supervised training we\nexploit paired full-lung and cardiac CTs acquired in the Multi-Ethnic Study of\nAtherosclerosis (MESA). Our network significantly outperforms a proxy direct\nALR inference on segmented cardiac CT scans and achieves accuracy and\nreproducibility comparable with a scan-rescan reproducibility of the FL ALR\nground-truth.",

Specifically, we propose the novel XingGAN (or\nCrossingGAN), which consists of two generation branches that capture the\nperson's appearance and shape, respectively. Moreover, we propose two novel\ncross-attention blocks to effectively transfer and update the person's shape\nand appearance embeddings for mutual improvement. This has not been considered\nby any other existing GAN-based image generation work. To further learn the\nlong-range correlations between different person poses at different scales and\nsub-regions, we propose two novel multi-scale cross-attention blocks. To tackle\nthe issue of independent correlation computations within the cross-attention\nmechanism leading to noisy and ambiguous attention weights, which hinder\nperformance improvements, we propose a module called enhanced attention (EA).\nLastly, we introduce a novel densely connected co-attention module to fuse\nappearance and shape features at different stages effectively. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\noutperforms current GAN-based methods and performs on par with diffusion-based\nmethods. However, our method is significantly faster than diffusion-based\nmethods in both training and inference.",

    "abstract": "This contribution addresses the question commonly asked in scientific\nliterature about the sources of multifractality in time series. Two primary\nsources are typically considered. These are temporal correlations and heavy\ntails in the distribution of fluctuations. Most often, they are treated as two\nindependent components, while true multifractality cannot occur without\ntemporal correlations. The distributions of fluctuations affect the span of the\nmultifractal spectrum only when correlations are present. These issues are\nillustrated here using series generated by several model mathematical cascades,\nwhich by design build correlations into these series. The thickness of the\ntails of fluctuations in such series is then governed by an appropriate\nprocedure of adjusting them to $q$-Gaussian distributions, and $q$ is treated\nas a variable parameter that, while preserving correlations, allows to tune\nthese distributions to the desired functional form. Multifractal detrended\nfluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical method for\nquantifying multifractality, is then used to identify the influence of the\nthickness of the fluctuation tails in the presence of temporal correlations on\nthe width of multifractal spectra. The obtained results point to the Gaussian\ndistribution, so $q=1$, as the appropriate reference distribution to evaluate\nthe contribution of fatter tails to the width of multifractal spectra. An\nappropriate procedure is presented to make such estimates.",

To address this challenge, we\npropose an agent system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and\nknowledge graphs. By leveraging LLMs' powerful capabilities for extracting and\nrecognizing chemical substance names, and storing the extracted data in a\nstructured knowledge graph, our system fully automates the retrieval of\nrelevant literatures, extraction of reaction data, database querying,\nconstruction of retrosynthetic pathway trees, further expansion through the\nretrieval of additional literature and recommendation of optimal reaction\npathways.

A~refinement of this\nnotion is the \\emph{$r$-profile complexity}, that counts the maximum number of\ndistinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring\ndistances larger than~$r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as\ngraphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded,\nleading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.\n  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the\n$r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes.\nWe show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is\nin $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most~$t$, we give a bound in\n$O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of~$t$ as a factor.

    "abstract": "Estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) from observational\ndata plays a crucial role in areas such as e-commerce, healthcare, and\neconomics. Existing studies mainly rely on the strong ignorability assumption\nthat there are no hidden confounders, whose existence cannot be tested from\nobservational data and can invalidate any causal conclusion. In contrast, data\ncollected from randomized controlled trials (RCT) do not suffer from\nconfounding but are usually limited by a small sample size. To avoid\noverfitting caused by the small-scale RCT data, we propose a novel two-stage\npretraining-finetuning (TSPF) framework with a partial parameter initialization\nstrategy to estimate the CATE in the presence of hidden confounding. In the\nfirst stage, a foundational representation of covariates is trained to estimate\ncounterfactual outcomes through large-scale observational data. In the second\nstage, we propose to train an augmented representation of the covariates, which\nis concatenated with the foundational representation obtained in the first\nstage to adjust for the hidden confounding. Rather than training a separate\nnetwork from scratch, part of the prediction heads are initialized from the\nfirst stage. The superiority of our approach is validated on two datasets with\nextensive experiments.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) property of scenario\ndecision algorithms, which refers to their ability to produce decisions with an\narbitrarily low risk of violating unknown safety constraints, provided a\nsufficient number of realizations of these constraints are sampled. While\nseveral PAC sufficient conditions for such algorithms exist in the literature\n-- such as the finiteness of the VC dimension of their associated classifiers,\nor the existence of a compression scheme -- it remains unclear whether these\nconditions are also necessary. In this work, we demonstrate through\ncounterexamples that these conditions are not necessary in general. These\nfindings stand in contrast to binary classification learning, where analogous\nconditions are both sufficient and necessary for a family of classifiers to be\nPAC. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to stable scenario decision\nalgorithms, a broad class that includes practical methods like scenario\noptimization. Even under this additional assumption, we show that the\naforementioned conditions remain unnecessary. Furthermore, we introduce a novel\nquantity, called the dVC dimension, which serves as an analogue to the VC\ndimension for scenario decision algorithms. We prove that the finiteness of\nthis dimension is a PAC necessary condition for scenario decision algorithms.\nThis allows to (i) guide algorithm users and designers to recognize algorithms\nthat are not PAC, and (ii) contribute to a comprehensive characterization of\nPAC scenario decision algorithms.",

Prior KD\ntechniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models.\nHowever, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged,\nranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision\nTransformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently,\ndeveloping a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become\nan important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based\none-for-all (FOFA) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse\narchitecture. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design\nprompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher\nfeatures to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose\nregion-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between\nheterogeneous architecture. By leveraging these two modules, effective\ndistillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous\narchitectures.

In this paper, we focus on mini-batch SGDM with constant\nlearning rate and constant momentum weight, which is frequently used to train\ndeep neural networks in practice. The contribution of this paper is showing\ntheoretically that using a constant batch size does not always minimize the\nexpectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss in training a deep\nneural network, whereas using an increasing batch size definitely minimizes it,\nthat is, increasing batch size improves convergence of mini-batch SGDM.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose novel methods to strategically select a small subset of unlabeled\ndata essential for SSAT and robustness improvement.

The flow behavior revealed distinct\nphenomena, including shear layer separation for subsonic and transonic flows,\nand a fully enclosed recirculation region under the overhang in supersonic\ncases. The time-averaged flow field identified potential temperature hotspots\nduring the initial transients, which intensified as time evolved. For Mach\n0.50, the amplitude of the thin panel oscillations increased as the flow\ntransitioned from transient to steady-state conditions. In the transonic case\n(M = 0.95), the oscillation amplitude became significantly larger, potentially\nleading to resonant behavior and structural failure (we did not model failure).\nHowever, in the supersonic cases, the oscillations stabilized and were\nsustained after the initial transients. The research quantitatively identifies\nthe influence of the Mach number on the fluid-structure interaction phenomena,\nwhich affect pressure loads and the development of thermal hotspots, which are\ncrucial elements in engineering design.",

For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor\ngraph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is\nexpanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel\ncode, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of\nthe GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the\nmain problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the\nrobustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver.\nAdditionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN\nindependent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep\nlearning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual\noptimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we\npropose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns\nout to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is\nanalyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations\nand codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain\ncompared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages\nbetween nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation\nin a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at\nfirst glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible\nnon-neural baseline.",

Such contact centers face unique challenges\ncompared to traditional call centers, as measuring customer experience proxies\nlike abandonment and patience involves uncertainty. A key source of this\nuncertainty is silent abandonment, where customers leave without notifying the\nsystem, wasting agent time and leaving their status unclear. Silent abandonment\nalso obscures whether a customer was served or left. Our goals are to measure\nthe magnitude of silent abandonment and mitigate its effects. Classification\nmodels show that 3%-70% of customers across 17 companies abandon silently. In\none study, 71.3% of abandoning customers did so silently, reducing agent\nefficiency by 3.2% and system capacity by 15.3%, incurring $5,457 in annual\ncosts per agent. We develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to\nestimate customer patience under uncertainty and identify influencing\ncovariates. We find that companies should use classification models to estimate\nabandonment scope and our EM algorithm to assess patience. We suggest\nstrategies to operationally mitigate the impact of silent abandonment by\npredicting suspected silent-abandonment behavior or changing service design.\nSpecifically, we show that while allowing customers to write while waiting in\nthe queue creates a missing data challenge, it also significantly increases\npatience and reduces service time, leading to reduced abandonment and lower\nstaffing requirements.",

On the inclusion of integrability-breaking\nperturbations, diffusive transport with $z=2$ is generically expected to hold\nin the limit of late time. Recent studies of the classical\nHaldane-Ishimori-Skylanin model have found that perturbations that preserve the\nglobal symmetry lead to a much slower timescale for the onset of diffusion,\nalbeit with uncertainty over the exact scaling exponent. That is, for\nperturbations of strength $\\lambda$, the characteristic timescale for diffusion\ngoes as $t_*\\sim \\lambda^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha$. Using large-scale matrix\nproduct state simulations, we investigate this behavior for perturbations to\nthe canonical quantum model showing superdiffusion: the $S=1/2$ quantum\nHeisenberg chain. We consider a ladder configuration and look at various\nperturbations that either break or preserve the $SU(2)$ symmetry, leading to\nscaling exponents consistent with those observed in one classical study\narXiv:2402.18661: $\\alpha=2$ for symmetry-breaking terms and $\\alpha=6$ for\nsymmetry-preserving terms. We also consider perturbations from another\nintegrable point of the ladder model with $G=SU(4)$ and find consistent\nresults. Finally, we consider a generalization to an $SU(3)$ ladder and find\nthat the $\\alpha=6$ scaling appears to be universal across superdiffusive\nsystems when the perturbations preserve the non-abelian symmetry $G$.",

To protect privacy, defensive noises can\nbe added to original samples to degrade their learnability by DNNs. Recently,\nunlearnable examples are proposed to minimize the training loss such that the\nmodel learns almost nothing. However, raw data are often pre-processed before\nbeing used for training, which may restore the private information of protected\ndata. In this paper, we reveal the data privacy violation induced by data\naugmentation, a commonly used data pre-processing technique to improve model\ngeneralization capability, which is the first of its kind as far as we are\nconcerned. We demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly raise the\naccuracy of the model trained on unlearnable examples from 21.3% to 66.1%. To\naddress this issue, we propose a defense framework, dubbed ARMOR, to protect\ndata privacy from potential breaches of data augmentation. To overcome the\ndifficulty of having no access to the model training process, we design a\nnon-local module-assisted surrogate model that better captures the effect of\ndata augmentation. In addition, we design a surrogate augmentation selection\nstrategy that maximizes distribution alignment between augmented and\nnon-augmented samples, to choose the optimal augmentation strategy for each\nclass. We also use a dynamic step size adjustment algorithm to enhance the\ndefensive noise generation process. Extensive experiments are conducted on 4\ndatasets and 5 data augmentation methods to verify the performance of ARMOR.\nComparisons with 6 state-of-the-art defense methods have demonstrated that\nARMOR can preserve the unlearnability of protected private data under data\naugmentation. ARMOR reduces the test accuracy of the model trained on augmented\nprotected samples by as much as 60% more than baselines.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown promising results in the detection of Mild\nCognitive Impairment (MCI) using easily accessible Electroencephalogram (EEG)\ndata which would help administer early and effective treatment for dementia\npatients. However, the reliability and practicality of such systems remains\nunclear. In this work, we investigate the potential limitations and challenges\nin developing a robust MCI detection method using two contrasting datasets: 1)\nCAUEEG, collected and annotated by expert neurologists in controlled settings\nand 2) GENEEG, a new dataset collected and annotated in general practice\nclinics, a setting where routine MCI diagnoses are typically made. We find that\ntraining on small datasets, as is done by most previous works, tends to produce\nhigh variance models that make overconfident predictions, and are unreliable in\npractice. Additionally, distribution shifts between datasets make cross-domain\ngeneralization challenging. Finally, we show that MCI detection using EEG may\nsuffer from fundamental limitations because of the overlapping nature of\nfeature distributions with control groups. We call for more effort in\nhigh-quality data collection in actionable settings (like general practice\nclinics) to make progress towards this salient goal of non-invasive MCI\ndetection.",

Both academia\nand industry widely recognize that islanded AC microgrids normally rely on\nbattery energy storage systems (BESSs) for grid-forming functions. However, the\nhigh cost of BESS significantly increases the levelized cost of hydrogen\n(LCOH), compromising economic feasibility. To address this challenge and reduce\nthe LCOH, this paper focuses on a wind turbine (WT) supplying an electrolyzer\nin a storage-less microgrid and identifies a unique characteristic that\nchallenges the conventional understanding of this microgrid: active power is\ncoupled with microgrid voltage rather than frequency, the latter being entirely\ndecoupled from active power balance. Based on this unique characteristic, this\npaper develops a new control strategy that maintains power balance, stabilizes\nthe voltage and frequency, and maximizes hydrogen production. The effectiveness\nof the control strategy is validated through case studies conducted in\nMatlab/Simulink, especially its capability to maintain stability while\nmaximizing hydrogen production under various conditions.",

Quantum-chemical modeling identifies a strong wave function\noverlap between an electron and a hole of the guest-host in a closely packed\ncrystal configuration forming the charge-transfer absorption state.

Objective: Using a novel machine\nlearning framework, this study evaluated the feasibility of integrating active\nand passive smartphone data to predict mental disorders in non-clinical\nadolescents. Specifically, we investigated the utility of the Mindcraft app in\npredicting risks for internalising and externalising disorders, eating\ndisorders, insomnia and suicidal ideation. Methods: Participants (N=103; mean\nage 16.1 years) were recruited from three London schools. Participants\ncompleted the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Eating Disorders-15\nQuestionnaire, Sleep Condition Indicator Questionnaire and indicated the\npresence/absence of suicidal ideation. They used the Mindcraft app for 14 days,\ncontributing active data via self-reports and passive data from smartphone\nsensors.

The model evaluation\nemployed leave-one-subject-out cross-validation using balanced accuracy as the\nprimary metric. Results: The integration of active and passive data achieved\nsuperior performance compared to individual data sources, with mean balanced\naccuracies of 0.71 for SDQ-High risk, 0.67 for insomnia, 0.77 for suicidal\nideation and 0.70 for eating disorders.

    "abstract": "One of the classic problems in online decision-making is the *secretary\nproblem* where to goal is to maximize the probability of choosing the largest\nnumber from a randomly ordered sequence. A natural extension allows selecting\nmultiple values under a combinatorial constraint. Babaioff, Immorlica, Kempe,\nand Kleinberg (SODA'07, JACM'18) introduced the *matroid secretary conjecture*,\nsuggesting an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm exists for matroids. Many works\nsince have attempted to obtain algorithms for both general matroids and\nspecific classes of matroids. The ultimate goal is to obtain an $e$-competitive\nalgorithm, and the *strong matroid secretary conjecture* states that this is\npossible for general matroids.\n  A key class of matroids is the *graphic matroid*, where a set of graph edges\nis independent if it contains no cycle. The rich combinatorial structure of\ngraphs makes them a natural first step towards solving a problem for general\nmatroids. Babaioff et al. (SODA'07, JACM'18) first studied the graphic matroid\nsetting, achieving a $16$-competitive algorithm. Subsequent works have improved\nthe competitive ratio, most recently to 4 by Soto, Turkieltaub, and Verdugo\n(SODA'18).\n  We break this $4$-competitive barrier, presenting a new algorithm with a\ncompetitive ratio of $3.95$. For simple graphs, we further improve this to\n$3.77$. Intuitively, solving the problem for simple graphs is easier since they\nlack length-two cycles. A natural question is whether a ratio arbitrarily close\nto $e$ can be achieved by assuming sufficiently large girth.\n  We answer this affirmatively, showing a competitive ratio arbitrarily close\nto $e$ even for constant girth values, supporting the strong matroid secretary\nconjecture. We also prove this bound is tight: for any constant $g$, no\nalgorithm can achieve a ratio better than $e$ even when the graph has girth at\nleast $g$.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing underwater images with non-uniform illumination (NUI) is crucial\nfor improving visibility and visual quality in marine environments, where image\ndegradation is caused by significant absorption and scattering effects.\nHowever, traditional model-based methods are often ineffective at capturing the\ncomplex illumination variations present in such images, resulting in limited\nvisual improvements. On the other hand, learning-based approaches have shown\npromising results but face challenges due to the lack of specific datasets\ndesigned to effectively address the non-uniform illumination problem. To\novercome these challenges, the Underwater Non-uniform Illumination Restoration\nNetwork (UNIR-Net) is introduced, a novel method that integrates illumination\nenhancement and attention blocks, along with visual refinement and contrast\ncorrection modules. This approach is specifically designed to mitigate the\nscattering and absorption effects that cause light attenuation in underwater\nenvironments. Additionally, the Paired Underwater Non-uniform Illumination\n(PUNI) dataset is presented, a paired resource that facilitates the restoration\nof underwater images under non-uniform illumination conditions. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the PUNI dataset and the large-scale real-world\nNon-Uniform Illumination Dataset (NUID), which contains underwater images with\nnon-uniform illumination, demonstrate the robust generalization ability of\nUNIR-Net. This method outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative\nmetrics and qualitative evaluations. Furthermore, UNIR-Net not only\nsignificantly enhances the visual quality of images but also improves\nperformance in advanced computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation in\nunderwater environments, highlighting its broad applicability and potential\nimpact.

Currently, significant computational cost for finding optimal\nprompts for every test sample hinders the deployment of VICL, as determining\nwhich demonstrations to use for constructing prompts is very costly. In this\npaper, however, we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that most test samples\nactually achieve optimal performance under the same prompts, and searching for\nsample-level prompts only costs more time but results in completely identical\nprompts. Therefore, we propose task-level prompting to reduce the cost of\nsearching for prompts during the inference stage and introduce two time-saving\nyet effective task-level prompt search strategies.

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce ToMATO, a new ToM benchmark formulated as multiple-choice QA over\nconversations. ToMATO is generated via LLM-LLM conversations featuring\ninformation asymmetry. By employing a prompting method that requires\nrole-playing LLMs to verbalize their thoughts before each utterance, we capture\nboth first- and second-order mental states across five categories: belief,\nintention, desire, emotion, and knowledge. These verbalized thoughts serve as\nanswers to questions designed to assess the mental states of characters within\nconversations. Furthermore, the information asymmetry introduced by hiding\nthoughts from others induces the generation of false beliefs about various\nmental states. Assigning distinct personality traits to LLMs further\ndiversifies both utterances and thoughts. ToMATO consists of 5.4k questions,\n753 conversations, and 15 personality trait patterns. Our analysis shows that\nthis dataset construction approach frequently generates false beliefs due to\nthe information asymmetry between role-playing LLMs, and effectively reflects\ndiverse personalities.

    "abstract": "The mismatch between the mass function of the Milky Way's embedded clusters\n(ECs) and that of open clusters (OCs) raises the question of whether each OC\noriginates from a single EC. In this work, we explore a scenario in which OCs\nform as a result of post-gas expulsion coalescence of ECs within the same\nparental molecular cloud. We model this process using N-body simulations of ECs\nundergoing expansion due to gas expulsion. Our initial conditions are based on\nthe observed spatial, kinematic, and mass distributions of ECs in three\nrepresentative massive star-forming regions (MSFRs). Initially, ECs are\nisolated. After further expansion, interactions between ECs begin, mutually\ninfluencing their evolution. We examine this process as a function of gas\nexpulsion timescales, spatial separations between ECs, and their relative\nvelocities. Our results demonstrate that, within a reasonable range of these\nparameters, the coalescence of ECs is robust and largely insensitive to initial\nconditions. The mass of ECs plays a critical role in the coalescence process.\nMore massive ECs form stable gravitational cores, which greatly facilitate\ncoalescence and help the resulting cluster resist expansion and Galactic tidal\nforces. Additionally, the number of ECs also enhances coalescence. The current\nmass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way suggests that directly forming\nmassive ECs is challenging. However, the coalescence of multiple low-mass ECs\ncan account for the observed parameter space of OCs in the Milky Way.",

Discrete spacetime considers that spacetime\nhas a cellular structure on the order of the Planck length, and if this is true\nwe should certainly have observable effects. In this paper, we investigated the\neffects caused by the dispersive vacuum on the decoherence process of an\nUnruh-DeWitt detector, our setup consists of a uniformly accelerated detector,\ninitially in a qubit state, which interacts with a massless scalar field during\na time interval finite. We use dispersion relations drawn from doubly special\nrelativity and Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, with these modifications the vacuum\nbecomes dispersive and has a corresponding refractive index. We calculate the\nprobability transition rates, the probability of finding the detector in the\nground state, and the quantum coherence variation. Our results indicate that\nthe decoherence process occurs more quickly in cases with changes in the\ndispersion relation in the regime of high accelerations and interaction time.\nAdditionally, the decoherence increases as the vacuum becomes more dispersive\ndue to the increase in the order of modification in the dispersion relation,\nand this happens because the dispersive vacuum amplifies the effects of quantum\nfluctuations that are captured by the detector when interacting with the field.",

To address this gap, this work introduces\na new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level\nand layout-level retrieval.

We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order\ndeviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only\non the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When\nramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the\nderivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast,\nramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a\nhigh-order correlation function defined in the steady state.

Subdivision\nschemes employ a scalar filter; that is, scalar subdivision schemes, have been\nextensively studied in the literature. In contrast, subdivision schemes with a\nmatrix filter, which are the so-called vector subdivision schemes, are far from\nbeing well understood. So far, only vector subdivision schemes that use special\nmatrix-valued filters have been well-investigated, such as the Lagrange and\nHermite subdivision schemes. To the best of our knowledge, it remains unclear\nhow to define and characterize the convergence of a vector subdivision scheme\nthat uses a general matrix-valued filter. Though filters from Lagrange and\nHermite subdivision schemes have nice properties and are widely used in\npractice, filters not from either subdivision scheme appear in many\napplications. Hence, it is necessary to study vector subdivision schemes with a\ngeneral matrix-valued filter. In this paper, from the perspective of a vector\ncascade algorithm, we show that there is only one meaningful way to define a\nvector subdivision scheme. We will analyze the convergence of the newly defined\nvector subdivision scheme and show that it is equivalent to the convergence of\nthe corresponding vector cascade algorithm. Applying our theory, we show that\nexisting results on the convergence of Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes\ncan be easily obtained and improved.

Transferring CLIP to downstream tasks\n(e.g. zero- or few-shot classification) is a hot topic in multimodal learning.\nHowever, current studies primarily focus on either prompt learning for text or\nadapter tuning for vision, without fully exploiting the complementary\ninformation and correlations among image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose\nan Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter (IDEA) method to adapt CLIP to\nfew-shot image classification tasks. This method captures fine-grained features\nby leveraging both visual features and textual descriptions of images. IDEA is\na training-free method for CLIP, and it can be comparable to or even exceeds\nstate-of-the-art models on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce\nTrainable-IDEA (T-IDEA), which extends IDEA by adding two lightweight learnable\ncomponents (i.e., a projector and a learnable latent space), further enhancing\nthe model's performance and achieving SOTA results on 11 datasets. As one\nimportant contribution, we employ the Llama model and design a comprehensive\npipeline to generate textual descriptions for images of 11 datasets, resulting\nin a total of 1,637,795 image-text pairs, named \"IMD-11\".

We present the results from an analysis of\nmulti-wavelength photometric and radio follow-up observations covering a period\nof ~9 years since its discovery. We find that following a luminosity plateau of\n~500 days, the UV/optical emission has decayed back to the pre-outburst level,\nsuggesting that the nuclear outburst might be caused by a stellar tidal\ndisruption event (TDE). In this case, SDSS J1115+0544 could be an unusually\nslow-evolved optical TDE with longest rise and decline time-scales ever found.\nThree years later than the optical peak, a delayed radio brightening was found\nwith a 5.5 GHz luminosity as high as ~1.9x10^39 erg/s. Using a standard\nequipartition analysis, we find the outflow powering the radio emission was\nlaunched at t~1260 days with a velocity of beta<~0.1 and kinetic energy of\nE_K~>10^50 erg. The delayed radio brightening coupled with the disappearing\nplateau in the UV/optical light curves is consistent with the scenario\ninvolving delayed ejection of an outflow from a state transition in the disk.\nSDSS J1115+0544 is the first TDE displaying both a short-lived UV/optical\nplateau emission and a late-time radio brightening. Future radio observations\nof these TDEs in the post-plateau decay phase will help to establish the\nconnection between outflow launching and changes in accretion rate.",

However,\nthe quality of AI-generated music has not yet reached this standard, primarily\ndue to the challenge of effectively controlling musical emotions and ensuring\nhigh-quality outputs. This paper presents a generalized symbolic music\ngeneration framework, XMusic, which supports flexible prompts (i.e., images,\nvideos, texts, tags, and humming) to generate emotionally controllable and\nhigh-quality symbolic music. XMusic consists of two core components, XProjector\nand XComposer. XProjector parses the prompts of various modalities into\nsymbolic music elements (i.e., emotions, genres, rhythms and notes) within the\nprojection space to generate matching music. XComposer contains a Generator and\na Selector. The Generator generates emotionally controllable and melodious\nmusic based on our innovative symbolic music representation, whereas the\nSelector identifies high-quality symbolic music by constructing a multi-task\nlearning scheme involving quality assessment, emotion recognition, and genre\nrecognition tasks. In addition, we build XMIDI, a large-scale symbolic music\ndataset that contains 108,023 MIDI files annotated with precise emotion and\ngenre labels. Objective and subjective evaluations show that XMusic\nsignificantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods with impressive\nmusic quality.

Bluetooth AoA\npositioning uses angles to determine the position of Bluetooth tags; these\nangles, measured in the anchor coordinate system, need to be transferred to the\nuser's coordinate system.

In addition, this paper tests the\nBluetooth AoA calibration and positioning model on a real dataset and presents\nend-toend functional architectures for AoA positioning.

Remarkably,\nthe model exhibits emergent reasoning capabilities, correctly predicting the\nattack type (print or replay) with high accuracy in few-shot scenarios, despite\nnot being explicitly instructed to classify attack types.

Informally, this means that the set of spanning trees of $G$\nnaturally forms a group, except that there is no distinguished identity\nelement. We generalize this fact to graphs embedded on orientable surfaces of\narbitrary genus, which can be identified with ribbon graphs. In this\ngeneralization, the set of spanning trees of $G$ is replaced by the set of\nspanning quasi-trees of the ribbon graph, and the Jacobian group of $G$ is\nreplaced by the Jacobian group of the associated regular orthogonal matroid $M$\n(along with an associated regular representation of $M$). Our proof shows, more\ngenerally, that the family of \"BBY torsors\" constructed by Backman--Baker--Yuen\nand later generalized by Ding admit natural generalizations to (regular\nrepresentations of) regular orthogonal matroids. In addition to shedding light\non the role of planarity in the earlier work mentioned above, our results\nrepresent one of the first substantial applications of orthogonal matroids\n(also called \"even delta-matroids\" or \"Lagrangian orthogonal matroids\") to a\nnatural combinatorial problem about graphs.",

Distribution shifts in defocused images generally lead to\nperformance degradation of existing methods during out-of-distribution\ninferences. In this work, we gauge the intrinsic reason behind the performance\ndegradation, which is identified as the heterogeneity of lens-specific point\nspread functions. Empirical evidence supports this finding, motivating us to\nemploy a continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) paradigm for SIDD. However,\ntraditional CTTA methods, which primarily rely on entropy minimization, cannot\nsufficiently explore task-dependent information for pixel-level regression\ntasks like SIDD. To address this issue, we propose a novel Siamese\nnetworks-based continual test-time adaptation framework, which adapts source\nmodels to continuously changing target domains only requiring unlabeled target\ndata in an online manner. To further mitigate semantically erroneous textures\nintroduced by source SIDD models under severe degradation, we revisit the\nlearning paradigm through a structural causal model and propose Causal Siamese\nnetworks (CauSiam). Our method leverages large-scale pre-trained\nvision-language models to derive discriminative universal semantic priors and\nintegrates these priors into Siamese networks, ensuring causal identifiability\nbetween blurry inputs and restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CauSiam effectively improves the generalization performance of existing\nSIDD methods in continuously changing domains.",

We explore a boson distribution function by linearly\nexpanding the radial wave function near the black hole's event horizon.\nMoreover, by applying the Damour-Ruffini method, this allows us to calculate\nthe Hawking radiation flux. In the final section, we consider propagating wave\nin a slowly rotating Kerr-EMDA black hole for bosons having much larger Compton\nwavelength comparing to the size of rotating black hole. This condition allows\nus to use the asymptotic matching technique to calculate the amplification\nfactor for scalar fields in the Kerr-EMDA black hole.

The splitting interval\nis proportionally dependent on the VLF field amplitude. The VLF electric field\nsensor is enhanced by increasing the strength of the DC field, extending the\ntraceable measurement limit for weak VLF electric fields by more than an order\nof magnitude.

    "abstract": "We study the electromagnetic and meson-photon transition form factors (TFF)\nof light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. To\ncomprehensively account for both the longitudinal and transverse\nnonperturbative dynamics of hadronic constituents, we incorpoarate intrinsic\ntransverse momentum distributions (iTMDs) alongside the conventional light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The main motivations of this work are the\ndisjointedness of electromagnetic form factors between the theoretical\npredictions and the experimental measurements, and the BaBar-Belle tension of\npion-photon transition form factor in the large momentum transfers. Our\ncalculation is carried out at the next-to-leading-order for the contributions\nfrom leading and subleading twist LCDAs, and leading order for the twist four\ncontributions. Notably, this work presents the first systematic evaluation of\nhigher-twist contributions to meson-photon TFFs. The key findings are: (a)\niTMDs play a crucial role in describing form factor data, particularly in the\nsmall-to-intermediate momentum transfer region where they induce significant\nmodifications to pQCD predictions. (b) The extracted transverse size parameters\nfor valence quark states are found to be $\\beta_\\pi^2 = 0.51 \\pm 0.04$\nGeV$^{-2}$ and $\\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \\pm 0.05$ GeV$^{-2}$, the chiral mass of pion\nmeson $m_0^\\pi$ at $1$ GeV is determined to be $1.84 \\pm 0.07$ GeV. (c) The\nmeson-photon TFFs are predominantly governed by leading-twist LCDAs. The\niTMDs-enhanced pQCD results show better agreement with Belle's pion TFF data\nacross intermediate and large momentum transfers and favor a small\n$\\eta-\\eta^\\prime$ mixing angle. (d) Remarkably, the inclusion of iTMDs extends\nthe applicability of pQCD calculations down to a few GeV$^2$ for all considered\nform factors, significantly improving the theory-data consistency.",

However, apparent\ntrade-offs between acquisition time, image noise, and resolution limit clinical\napplicability. In particular, in regions of highly transient flow, coarse\ntemporal resolution can hinder accurate capture of physiologically relevant\nflow variations. To overcome these issues, post-processing techniques using\ndeep learning have shown promising results to enhance resolution post-scan\nusing so-called super-resolution networks. However, while super-resolution has\nbeen focusing on spatial upsampling, temporal super-resolution remains largely\nunexplored. The aim of this study was therefore to implement and evaluate a\nresidual network for temporal super-resolution 4D Flow MRI. To achieve this, an\nexisting spatial network (4DFlowNet) was re-designed for temporal upsampling,\nadapting input dimensions, and optimizing internal layer structures. Training\nand testing were performed using synthetic 4D Flow MRI data originating from\npatient-specific in-silico models, as well as using in-vivo datasets. Overall,\nexcellent performance was achieved with input velocities effectively denoised\nand temporally upsampled, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.0 cm/s in an\nunseen in-silico setting, outperforming deterministic alternatives (linear\ninterpolation MAE = 2.3 cm/s, sinc interpolation MAE = 2.6 cm/s). Further, the\nnetwork synthesized high-resolution temporal information from unseen\nlow-resolution in-vivo data, with strong correlation observed at peak flow\nframes. As such, our results highlight the potential of utilizing data-driven\nneural networks for temporal super-resolution 4D Flow MRI, enabling\nhigh-frame-rate flow quantification without extending acquisition times beyond\nclinically acceptable limits.",

This work introduces a method to realize controlled\narbitrary phase gates in Rydberg atoms by manipulating system dynamics using\nFFM. Notably, this method eliminates the need for laser addressing of\nindividual atoms, significantly enhancing convenience for future practical\napplications. Furthermore, this approach can be integrated with soft quantum\ncontrol strategies to enhance the fidelity and robustness of the resultant\ncontrolled-phase gates. Finally, as an example, this methodology is applied in\nGrover-Long algorithm to search target items with zero failure rate,\ndemonstrating its substantial significance for future quantum information\nprocessing applications. This work leveraging Rydberg atoms and Floquet\nfrequency modulation may herald a new era of scalable and reliable quantum\ncomputing.",

We argue that these\nmodels often establish shortcuts, resulting in spurious correlations between\nquestions and answers, especially when the alignment between video and text\ndata is suboptimal. To address these spurious correlations, we propose a novel\ntraining framework in which the model is compelled to acknowledge its ignorance\nwhen presented with an intervened question, rather than making guesses solely\nbased on superficial question-answer correlations. We introduce methodologies\nfor intervening in questions, utilizing techniques such as displacement and\nperturbation, and design frameworks for the model to admit its lack of\nknowledge in both multi-choice VideoQA and open-ended settings.

    "abstract": "Despite the no-hair theorem, several notable hairy black hole (BH) solutions\nexist in both General Relativity and modified gravity theories. For such hairs\nto be detectable, they must extend sufficiently beyond the event horizon. This\nidea has been rigorously formalized by the no-short hair theorem, which\ndictates that all existing hairs of a static spherically symmetric BH must\nextend at least to the innermost light ring (LR). However, the theorem's\napplicability to the astrophysically relevant rotating BHs remains elusive as\nyet. To address this gap, we examine its validity for rotating BHs in the\nKonoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko-Stuchl\\'ik and Johannsen classes. Interestingly, for\nKlein-Gordon separable BHs in these classes that are solutions of non-vacuum\nGR, the no-short hair property continues to hold. However, unlike in static\ncases, this result may not apply in a theory-agnostic fashion due to the\nrotation-induced repulsive effects. Consequently, we identify a minimal set of\nadditional criteria on the metric and matter content needed for such a\ngeneralization in other theories. Our study marks an important first step\ntoward establishing general results on the extent of rotating BH hairs,\nreinforcing their observational detections. Further extension of this novel\nresult for rotating horizonless objects is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is one of the most crucial tasks in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), involving the training of machine learning models to classify\ntext based on the polarity of opinions. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) can\nbe applied to downstream tasks through fine-tuning, eliminating the need to\ntrain the model from scratch. Specifically, PLMs have been employed for\nSentiment Analysis, a process that involves detecting, analyzing, and\nextracting the polarity of text sentiments. Numerous models have been proposed\nto address this task, with pre-trained PhoBERT-V2 models standing out as the\nstate-of-the-art language models for Vietnamese. The PhoBERT-V2 pre-training\napproach is based on RoBERTa, optimizing the BERT pre-training method for more\nrobust performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines\nPhoBERT-V2 and SentiWordnet for Sentiment Analysis of Vietnamese reviews. Our\nproposed model utilizes PhoBERT-V2 for Vietnamese, offering a robust\noptimization for the prominent BERT model in the context of Vietnamese\nlanguage, and leverages SentiWordNet, a lexical resource explicitly designed to\nsupport sentiment classification applications. Experimental results on the VLSP\n2016 and AIVIVN 2019 datasets demonstrate that our sentiment analysis system\nhas achieved excellent performance in comparison to other models.",

Pumping in this system exhibits several\nnotable differences from pumping in cubic media. While Chern indices\ncharacterizing quantized transport for uncoupled fundamental and second\nharmonic waves are nonzero, small-amplitude solitons with narrow spectra do not\nmove, thus revealing a non-topological phase. As the nonlinearity increases,\nthe system undergoes a sharp transition, depending on the velocity of one of\nthe sublattices forming dynamical potential, into the phase where the quantized\ntransport of quadratic solitons governed by nonzero Chern numbers is observed.\nThe power level at which this transition occurs increases with increase of\npumping velocity, and the transition is observed even in the regime when the\nadiabatic approximation no longer applies.

In oncology they have been used to\nsummarise evidence within a disease area but have not been used to compare\nevidence across different diseases. As an increasing number of oncology drugs\nare licensed for multiple indications, visualising the accumulation of evidence\nacross all indications can help inform policy-makers, support evidence\nsynthesis approaches, or to guide expert elicitation on appropriate\ncross-indication assumptions. Methods: The multi-indication oncology therapy\nbevacizumab was selected as a case-study. We used visualisation methods\nincluding timeline, ridgeline and split-violin plots to display evidence across\nseven licensed cancer types, focusing on the evolution of evidence on overall\nand progression-free survival over time as well as the quality of the evidence\navailable. Results: Evidence maps for bevacizumab allow for visualisation of\npatterns in study-level evidence, which can be updated as evidence accumulates\nover time. The developed tools display the observed data and synthesised\nevidence across- and within-indications. Limitations: The effectiveness of the\nplots produced are limited by the lack of complete and consistent reporting of\nevidence in trial reports. Trade-offs were necessary when deciding the level of\ndetail that could be shown while keeping the plots coherent. Conclusions: Clear\ngraphical representations of the evolution and accumulation of evidence can\nprovide a better understanding of the entire evidence base which can inform\njudgements regarding the appropriate use of data within and across indications.\nImplications: Improved visualisations of evidence can help the development of\nmulti-indication evidence synthesis.

Current research on hot carriers has predominantly focused\non inorganic materials, with little attention paid to organic-based systems due\nto their ultrafast energy relaxation and inefficient charge transport. Here, we\noverturn this paradigm by demonstrating highly mobile hot carriers in\nsolution-processable, highly crystalline two-dimensional conjugated\ncoordination polymer (2D c-CP) Cu3BHT (BHT = benzenehexathiol) films.\nLeveraging a suite of ultrafast spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we\nunravel the microscopic charge transport landscape in Cu3BHT films following\nnon-equilibrium photoexcitation across temporal, spatial, and frequency\ndomains, revealing two distinct high-mobility transport regimes. In the\nnon-equilibrium transport regime, hot carriers achieve ultrahigh mobility of\n~2,000 cm2 V-1 s-1, traversing grain boundaries up to 300 nm within a\npicosecond. In the quasi-equilibrium transport regime, free carriers exhibit\nDrude-type band-like transport with a remarkable mobility of ~400 cm2 V-1 s-1\nand an intrinsic diffusion length exceeding 1 micrometer. These findings\nestablish 2D c-CPs as versatile platforms for exploring high-mobility\nnon-equilibrium transport, unlocking new opportunities for organic-based hot\ncarrier applications.",

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators.\nHowever, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often\nlack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To\nthis end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting\nfor crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D\nscenes from text or image inputs.

Additionally,\nwe propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that\nutilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance\nthe realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a\nstructured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash\ngrids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which\nsignificantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead.\nComprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant\npotential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.",

    "abstract": "The non-destructive readout mode of a detector allows its pixels to be read\nmultiple times during integration, generating a series of \"up-the-ramp\" images\nthat keep accumulating photons between successive frames. Since the noise is\ncorrelated across these images, an optimal stacking generally requires\nweighting them unequally to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for\nthe target. Objects in the sky show wildly different brightness, and the counts\nin the pixels of the same object also span a wide range. Therefore, a single\nset of weights cannot be optimal for all cases. To keep the stacked image more\neasily calibratable, however, we choose to apply the same weight to all the\npixels in the same frame. In practice, we find that the results of high-SNR\ncases degrade only slightly by adopting weights derived for low-SNR cases,\nwhereas the low-SNR cases are more sensitive to the weights applied. We\ntherefore propose a quasi-optimal stacking method that maximizes the stacked\nSNR for the case of SNR=1 per pixel in the last frame and demonstrate with\nsimulated data that it always enhances the SNR more than the equal-weight\nstacking method and the ramp fitting method. Furthermore, we give an estimate\nof the improvement of limiting magnitudes for the China Space Station Telescope\n(CSST) based on this method. Compared with the conventional readout mode, which\nis equivalent to taking the last frame of the non-destructive readout, stacking\n30 up-the-ramp images can improve the limiting magnitude by about 0.5 mag for\nCSST near-infrared observations, effectively reducing the readout noise by\nabout 62%.",

    "abstract": "Since 2018, there has been a consistent decline in the distance traveled by\nU.S. manufacturing imports, reaching a level not observed since 2008. This\ntrend is the result of the substitution away from imports from China and\ntowards imports from closer countries. At the same time, U.S. manufacturing\ninventory-to-sales ratio has continued to rise. These trends are at odds with\nthe literature, which finds that reductions in the distance of imports are\nassociated with a decline in inventories. We argue that a rise in delivery time\nrisk, driven by longer and more frequent delays and supply disruptions, can\nreconcile these trends. We do so in the context of a model of global sourcing\nwith stochastic delivery times and inventories. Firms trade off the lower price\nof farther inputs with the increase in exposure to demand volatility and longer\ndelays. In response, firms increase their inventories. Yet, as delivery delays\nrise, firms need to carry more inventories per unit of the input used. We\ncalibrate the model for the period from 2018 to 2024 using data on the increase\nin tariffs for inputs from China, and the rise in inventories over sales. We\nfind an increase in delivery delays for foreign inputs of 21 days across the\nperiod. The rise in delays and tariffs had an output loss of 7.3% and a price\nincrease of 1.8%. Of these, the rise in delivery delays alone generated a 2.6%\ndrop in output and a 0.4% increase in prices.",

    "abstract": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of text-to-image models has become an\nincreasingly popular technique with many applications. Among the various PEFT\nmethods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant\nattention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with\nlimited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the\nlow-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous\nacquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce\nthis gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method\nthat combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual\nadaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the\npre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the\npre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby\nreducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be\neffectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures,\nwith a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in\npractice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for\nboth the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods\nsuch as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation\nscheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in\nsubject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our\nmethod can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to\nLoRA and several baselines.",

We present exploratory nonlinear\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in\nconvective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to\ntidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal\ncircularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital\nmigration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as\nincompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially\n(rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its\nstrength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number\nPm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be\nsubstantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong\ntidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large\ntidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial\nmagnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can\ninhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell\nstresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and\ncharacterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\\'en\nwaves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is\nclose to the linear predictions.

While\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has proven effective for learning\nrepresentations from unlabelled data, it typically focuses on flat,\nnon-hierarchical structures, missing the multi-level relationships present in\nmany real-world datasets. Hierarchical clustering (HC) can uncover these\nrelationships by organizing data into a tree-like structure, but it often\nrelies on rigid similarity metrics that struggle to capture the complexity of\ndiverse data types. To address these we envision $\\texttt{InfoHier}$, a\nframework that combines SSL with HC to jointly learn robust latent\nrepresentations and hierarchical structures. This approach leverages SSL to\nprovide adaptive representations, enhancing HC's ability to capture complex\npatterns. Simultaneously, it integrates HC loss to refine SSL training,\nresulting in representations that are more attuned to the underlying\ninformation hierarchy. $\\texttt{InfoHier}$ has the potential to improve the\nexpressiveness and performance of both clustering and representation learning,\noffering significant benefits for data analysis, management, and information\nretrieval.",

Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models struggle in certain\ncases, sometimes failing at problems solvable by young children, indicating\nthat traditional notions of task complexity are insufficient for explaining LLM\ncapabilities. However, exploring LLM capabilities is complicated by the fact\nthat most widely-used models are also \"instruction-tuned\" to respond\nappropriately to prompts. With the goal of disentangling the factors\ninfluencing LLM performance, we investigate whether instruction-tuned models\npossess fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are prompted\nusing in-context examples. Through extensive experiments across various model\nfamilies, scales and task types, which included instruction tuning 90 different\nLLMs, we demonstrate that the performance of instruction-tuned models is\nsignificantly correlated with the in-context performance of their base\ncounterparts. By clarifying what instruction-tuning contributes, we extend\nprior research into in-context learning, which suggests that base models use\npriors from pretraining data to solve tasks. Specifically, we extend this\nunderstanding to instruction-tuned models, suggesting that their pretraining\ndata similarly sets a limiting boundary on the tasks they can solve, with the\nadded influence of the instruction-tuning dataset.",

This leads\nto a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass\ngenerations are induced by the Majorana $N_{1R}$ mass and the Dirac $N_{2,3R}$\nmass, respectively. Although the lightest of the $Z_3$ fields is stabilized,\nresponsible for dark matter, the model lacks an explanation for relic density\nand/or direct detection.

Our proposed model, Deep Disentangled Interleaving\nVariational Encoding (DeepDIVE) learns disentangled features from the original\ninput to form clusters in the embedding space and unifies these features via\nthe cross-attention mechanism in the fusion stage. We theoretically prove that\ncombining the objectives for reconstruction and forecasting fully captures the\nlower bound and mathematically derive a loss function for disentanglement using\nNa\\\"ive Bayes. Under the assumption that the prior is a mixture of log-concave\ndistributions, we also establish that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nthe prior and the posterior is upper bounded by a function minimized by the\nminimizer of the cross entropy loss, informing our adoption of radial basis\nfunctions (RBF) and cross entropy with interleaving training for DeepDIVE to\nprovide a justified basis for convergence.

This fact provides a\nrare opportunity to study interesting details of the accretion within each\nindividual pulse of the compact object. In this paper, we analyze 200 ks of\nChandra grating data, divided into 9 uninterrupted observations around the\norbit. The changes in the circumstellar absorption column through the orbit\nsuggest an orbital inclination of $\\sim$ $40^{\\circ}$ with respect to the\nobserver and a companion mass-loss rate of $\\sim$ 8.6 10$^{-7}$ solar masses\nyr$^{-1}$. The peaks of the NS pulse show a large pulse-to-pulse variability.\nThree of them show an evolution from a brighter regime to a weaker one. We\npropose that the efficiency of Compton cooling in this source fluctuates\nthroughout an accumulation cycle. After significant depletion of matter within\nthe magnetosphere, since the settling velocity is $\\sim \\times$ 2 times lower\nthan the free-fall velocity, the source gradually accumulates matter until the\ndensity exceeds a critical threshold. This increase in density triggers a\ntransition to a more efficient Compton cooling regime, leading to a higher mass\naccretion rate and consequently to an increased brightness.",

The magnetic field dissipates inside the\ndisk, and magnetic flux accumulates around the edge of the disk, leading to the\noccurrence of interchange instability. During the main accretion phase, the\ninterchange instability occurs recurrently, disturbing the circumstellar region\nand forming ring, arc, and cavity structures. These are consistent with recent\nhigh-resolution observations of circumstellar regions around young protostars.\nThe structures extend to $>1,000$ au and persist for at least 30,000 yr after\nprotostar formation, demonstrating the dynamic removal process of magnetic flux\nduring star formation.

A more effective approach reduces the dynamics to the slow\nattracting invariant submanifold associated with the slowest contracting\ndirection, achieving a balance between simplification and accuracy. In this\nwork, we present an efficient numerical method to compute the parameterization\nof the attracting slow submanifold of hyperbolic limit cycles and the\nsimplified dynamics in its induced coordinates. Additionally, we compute the\ninfinitesimal Phase and Amplitude Response Functions (iPRF and iARF,\nrespectively) restricted to this manifold, which characterize the effects of\nperturbations on phase and amplitude. These results are obtained by solving an\ninvariance equation for the slow manifold and adjoint equations for the iPRF\nand iARF. To solve these functional equations efficiently, we employ the\nFloquet normal form to solve the invariance equation and propose a novel\ncoordinate transformation to simplify the adjoint equations.

This has driven\nthe development of virtual FFR (vFFR) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nto simulate coronary flow. Geometric deep learning algorithms have shown\npromise for learning features on meshes, including cardiovascular research\napplications. This study empirically analyzes various backends for predicting\nvFFR fields in coronary arteries as CFD surrogates, comparing six backends for\nlearning hemodynamics on meshes using CFD solutions as ground truth.\n  The study has two parts: i) Using 1,500 synthetic left coronary artery\nbifurcations, models were trained to predict pressure-related fields for vFFR\nreconstruction, comparing different learning variables. ii) Using 427\npatient-specific CFD simulations, experiments were repeated focusing on the\nbest-performing learning variable from the synthetic dataset.\n  Most backends performed well on the synthetic dataset, especially when\npredicting pressure drop over the manifold. Transformer-based backends\noutperformed others when predicting pressure and vFFR fields and were the only\nmodels achieving strong performance on patient-specific data, excelling in both\naverage per-point error and vFFR accuracy in stenotic lesions.\n  These results suggest geometric deep learning backends can effectively\nreplace CFD for simple geometries, while transformer-based networks are\nsuperior for complex, heterogeneous datasets. Pressure drop was identified as\nthe optimal network output for learning pressure-related fields.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of speaker-annotated far-field speech presents a significant\nchallenge in developing high-performance far-field speaker verification (SV)\nsystems. While data augmentation using large-scale near-field speech has been a\ncommon strategy to address this limitation, the mismatch in acoustic\nenvironments between near-field and far-field speech significantly hinders the\nimprovement of far-field SV effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an\nadaptive speech augmentation approach leveraging NaturalSpeech3, a pre-trained\nfoundation text-to-speech (TTS) model, to convert near-field speech into\nfar-field speech by incorporating far-field acoustic ambient noise for data\naugmentation. Specifically, we utilize FACodec from NaturalSpeech3 to decompose\nthe speech waveform into distinct embedding subspaces-content, prosody,\nspeaker, and residual (acoustic details) embeddings-and reconstruct the speech\nwaveform from these disentangled representations. In our method, the prosody,\ncontent, and residual embeddings of far-field speech are combined with speaker\nembeddings from near-field speech to generate augmented pseudo far-field speech\nthat maintains the speaker identity from the out-domain near-field speech while\npreserving the acoustic environment of the in-domain far-field speech. This\napproach not only serves as an effective strategy for augmenting training data\nfor far-field speaker verification but also extends to cross-data augmentation\nfor enrollment and test speech in evaluation trials.Experimental results on\nFFSVC demonstrate that the adaptive data augmentation method significantly\noutperforms traditional approaches, such as random noise addition and\nreverberation, as well as other competitive data augmentation strategies.",

Thus given that F-inverse monoids have an\nassociated extension it is natural to ask if these extensions satisfy any\nspecial properties. Indeed we show that $M$ is F-inverse if and only if the\naforementioned extension is weakly Schreier. This latter result allows us to\nmake use of relaxed factor systems to provide a new characterization of\nF-inverse monoids. We end by restricting to the Clifford case and find a new\ncharacterization of these with much in common with Artin gluings of frames.",

This is done via the Lyapunov function-based decay\ncondition, which describes along with the input constraints a set of admissible\ncontrols. Afterwards, the measurement time points are computed based on the\nsystem dynamics. It is shown that between these self-triggered measurement time\npoints, the system evolves and converges into the so-called target ball, i.e. a\nvicinity of the origin, where it remains. Furthermore, it is shown that the\napproach ensures the existence of a control law, which is admissible for all\npossible states and it introduces a connection between measurement time points,\nmeasurement accuracy, target ball, and decay.

The\nhallucination problem of large language models (LLMs) also makes it challenging\nfor LLM-based schema matching to address the above issues. Therefore, we\npropose a Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation model for Schema\nMatching, referred to as the KG-RAG4SM. In particular, KG-RAG4SM introduces\nnovel vector-based, graph traversal-based, and query-based graph retrievals, as\nwell as a hybrid approach and ranking schemes that identify the most relevant\nsubgraphs from external large knowledge graphs (KGs). We showcase that KG-based\nretrieval-augmented LLMs are capable of generating more accurate results for\ncomplex matching cases without any re-training. Our experimental results show\nthat KG-RAG4SM outperforms the LLM-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (e.g.,\nJellyfish-8B) by 35.89% and 30.50% in terms of precision and F1 score on the\nMIMIC dataset, respectively; KG-RAG4SM with GPT-4o-mini outperforms the\npre-trained language model (PLM)-based SOTA methods (e.g., SMAT) by 69.20% and\n21.97% in terms of precision and F1 score on the Synthea dataset, respectively.\nThe results also demonstrate that our approach is more efficient in end-to-end\nschema matching, and scales to retrieve from large KGs.

    "abstract": "Many active galaxies harbor powerful relativistic jets, however, the detailed\nmechanisms of their formation and acceleration remain poorly understood. To\ninvestigate the area of jet acceleration and collimation with the highest\navailable angular resolution, we study the innermost region of the bipolar jet\nin the nearby low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy NGC\n1052. We combined observations of NGC 1052 taken with VLBA, GMVA, and EHT over\none week in the spring of 2017. For the first time, NGC 1052 was detected with\nthe EHT, providing a size of the central region in-between both jet bases of\n250 RS (Schwarzschild radii) perpendicular to the jet axes. This size estimate\nsupports previous studies of the jets expansion profile which suggest two\nbreaks of the profile at around 300 RS and 10000 RS distances to the core.\nFurthermore, we estimated the magnetic field to be 1.25 Gauss at a distance of\n22 {\\mu}as from the central engine by fitting a synchrotron-self absorption\nspectrum to the innermost emission feature, which shows a spectral turn-over at\nabout 130 GHz. Assuming a purely poloidal magnetic field, this implies an upper\nlimit on the magnetic field strength at the event horizon of 26000 Gauss, which\nis consistent with previous measurements. The complex, low-brightness,\ndouble-sided jet structure in NGC 1052 makes it a challenge to detect the\nsource at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. However, our first EHT observations have\ndemonstrated that detection is possible up to at least 230 GHz. This study\noffers a glimpse through the dense surrounding torus and into the innermost\ncentral region, where the jets are formed.

Among these properties, the determination\nof the parity of 1s by distributed consensus has been a recurring endeavour in\nthe context of automata networks. In its most standard formulation, a\none-dimensional cellular automaton rule should process any odd-sized cyclic\nconfiguration and lead the lattice to converge to the homogeneous fixed point\nof 0s if the parity of 1s is even and to the homogeneous fixed point of 1s,\notherwise. The only known solution to this problem with a single rule was given\nby Betel, de Oliveira and Flocchini (coined BFO rule after the authors'\ninitials). However, three years later the authors of the BFO rule realised that\nthe rule would fail for some specific configuration and proposed a\ncomputationally sound fix, but a proof could not be worked out. Here we provide\nanother fix to the BFO rule along with a full proof, therefore reassuring that\na single-rule solution to the problem really does exist.",

Existing\nmethods, such as AniClipart, effectively model spatial deformations but often\nfail to ensure smooth temporal transitions, resulting in artifacts like abrupt\nmotions and geometric distortions. Similarly, text-to-video (T2V) and\nimage-to-video (I2V) models struggle to handle clipart due to the mismatch in\nstatistical properties between natural video and clipart styles. This paper\nintroduces FlexiClip, a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations\nby addressing the intertwined challenges of temporal consistency and geometric\nintegrity. FlexiClip extends traditional B\\'ezier curve-based trajectory\nmodeling with key innovations: temporal Jacobians to correct motion dynamics\nincrementally, continuous-time modeling via probability flow ODEs (pfODEs) to\nmitigate temporal noise, and a flow matching loss inspired by GFlowNet\nprinciples to optimize smooth motion transitions. These enhancements ensure\ncoherent animations across complex scenarios involving rapid movements and\nnon-rigid deformations. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nFlexiClip in generating animations that are not only smooth and natural but\nalso structurally consistent across diverse clipart types, including humans and\nanimals. By integrating spatial and temporal modeling with pre-trained video\ndiffusion models, FlexiClip sets a new standard for high-quality clipart\nanimation, offering robust performance across a wide range of visual content.\nProject Page: https://creative-gen.github.io/flexiclip.github.io/",

The dissipation of the qubit\nis exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct\ncoherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat\nstate, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where\nthe magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\\ket{0}$ and\n$\\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and\nodd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the\nshort-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing\ndiverse magnon non-classical states.

Such events are called monoscopic events, and their analysis is\nparticularly difficult. Challenges include the reconstruction of the event's\narrival direction, energy, and the rejection of background events. Here, we\npresent a set of improvements, including a machine-learning algorithm to\ndetermine the correct orientation of the image, an intensity-dependent\nselection cut that ensures optimal performance, and a collection of new image\nparameters. To quantify these improvements, we use the central telescope of the\nH.E.S.S. IACT array. Knowing the correct image orientation, which corresponds\nto the arrival direction of the photon in the camera frame, is especially\nimportant for the angular reconstruction, which could be improved in resolution\nby 57% at 100 GeV. The event selection cut, which now depends on the total\nmeasured intensity of the events, leads to a reduction of the low-energy\nthreshold for source analyses by ~50%. The new image parameters characterize\nthe intensity and time distribution within the recorded images and complement\nthe traditionally used Hillas parameters in the machine learning algorithms.

To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new\nframework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and\nlarge language models (LLM).

Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally,\nthe correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and\nformal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly\nselected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the\nquality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse).\nNotably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance,\nachieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable\ntypes, and 80.65% for contract attributes.",

    "abstract": "High update-to-data (UTD) ratio algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL)\nimprove sample efficiency but incur high computational costs, limiting\nreal-world scalability. We propose Offline Stabilization Phases for Efficient\nQ-Learning (SPEQ), an RL algorithm that combines low-UTD online training with\nperiodic offline stabilization phases. During these phases, Q-functions are\nfine-tuned with high UTD ratios on a fixed replay buffer, reducing redundant\nupdates on suboptimal data. This structured training schedule optimally\nbalances computational and sample efficiency, addressing the limitations of\nboth high and low UTD ratio approaches. We empirically demonstrate that SPEQ\nrequires from 40% to 99% fewer gradient updates and 27% to 78% less training\ntime compared to state-of-the-art high UTD ratio methods while maintaining or\nsurpassing their performance on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmark. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of periodic stabilization phases as an\neffective alternative to conventional training schedules, paving the way for\nmore scalable reinforcement learning solutions in real-world applications where\ncomputational resources are constrained.",

Longitudinal registration of sequential\nbrain MRI underpins such analyses. However, existing methods are limited by\nreliance on densely sampled time series, a trade-off between accuracy and\ntemporal smoothness, and an inability to prospectively forecast future brain\nstates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \\emph{TimeFlow}, a\nlearning-based framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration. TimeFlow uses\na U-Net backbone with temporal conditioning to model neuroanatomy as a\ncontinuous function of age. Given only two scans from an individual, TimeFlow\nestimates accurate and temporally coherent deformation fields, enabling\nnon-linear extrapolation to predict future brain states. This is achieved by\nour proposed inter-/extra-polation consistency constraints applied to both the\ndeformation fields and deformed images. Remarkably, these constraints preserve\ntemporal consistency and continuity without requiring explicit smoothness\nregularizers or densely sampled sequential data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that TimeFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both\nfuture timepoint forecasting and registration accuracy. Moreover, TimeFlow\nsupports novel biological brain aging analyses by differentiating\nneurodegenerative trajectories from normal aging without requiring\nsegmentation, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations and\nmitigating segmentation inconsistency. TimeFlow offers an accurate,\ndata-efficient, and annotation-free framework for longitudinal analysis of\nbrain aging and chronic diseases, capable of forecasting brain changes beyond\nthe observed study period.",

However, their generalization to real-world\nscenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world\nstereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image\ngeneration pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes\nhigh-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo\ndisparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous\nmethods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring\npixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to\nrecover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we\npropose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of\nunreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity\nSelection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while\npreventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art\nzero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume\ncomparable to Scene Flow.

One significant principle of\ncategorical logic is bringing together the semantics and the syntax of logical\nsystems in a common categorical framework. This thesis is intended to propose a\ndouble-categorical method for categorical logic in line with this principle. On\nthe semantic side, we investigate virtual double categories as a model of\npredicate logic and illustrate that this framework subsumes the existing\nframeworks properly.

Different regions in the area exhibit different\ncharacteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity\nand correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event\noccurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning\nspatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its\nfine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event\nprediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the\nstate dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation\nof a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial\ndependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and\njointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the\nmodel's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP\nmodel greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction.

Its polarisation\nbehaviour between 2015 and 2017 (MJD 57300-58000) contains several interesting\nevents that we re-contextualise in this study. We collected optical photometric\nand polarimetric data from several telescopes and obtained high-cadence light\ncurves from this period. In the radio band, we collected mm-wavelength\npolarisation data from the AMAPOLA program. We combined these with existing\nmultifrequency polarimetric radio results and the results of\nvery-long-baseline-interferometry imaging with the Global mm-VLBI Array at 86\nGHz. In December 2015, an optical flare was seen according to the general\nrelativistic binary black hole model. We suggest that the overall activity near\nthe accretion disk and the jet base during this time may be connected to the\nonset of a new moving component K seen in the jet in March 2017. With the\nadditional optical data, we find a fast polarisation angle rotation of 210\ndegrees coinciding with the December 2015 flare, hinting at a possible link\nbetween these events. Based on the 86-GHz images, we calculated a new speed of\n0.12 mas/yr for K, which places it inside the core at the time of the 2015\nflare. This speed also supports the scenario where the passage of K through the\nquasi-stationary feature S1 could have been the trigger for the\nvery-high-energy gamma-ray flare of OJ 287 seen in February 2017. With the\nmm-polarisation data, we established that these bands follow the cm-band data\nbut show a difference during the time of K passing through S1. This indicates\nthat the mm-bands trace the substructures of the jet still unresolved in the\ncm-bands.",

When added as a penalty term, we provide conditions under which such\ngeneralized $k$-support norms promote $k$-sparse solutions. The result follows\nfrom an analysis of the exposed faces of closed convex sets generated by\n$k$-sparse vectors, and of how primal support identification can be deduced\nfrom dual information.

For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor\nwith $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet\n$d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave\nmagnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed\nspin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry.

In biological brains, the challenge of long-range\ncommunication across regions is addressed through sparse, spike-based\nsignaling, minimizing energy and latency. Conversely, modern AI workloads are\nincreasingly constrained by bandwidth, leading to bottlenecks that hamper\nscalability and efficiency. Inspired by the brain's ability to execute dynamic\nand complex local computations coupled with sparse inter-neuron communication,\nwe propose heterogeneous neural networks that combine spiking neural networks\n(SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) at bandwidth-limited regions, such\nas chip boundaries, where spike-based communication reduces data transfer\noverhead.

Different pressure gradient histories are imposed on\nthe boundary layer through an aerofoil mounted in the freestream. Hot-wire\nmeasurements are taken at different freestream velocities downstream of the\naerofoil where the flow has locally recovered to zero pressure gradient but\nretains the history effects. Direct skin friction measurements are also made\nusing oil film interferometry for smooth walls and a floating element drag\nbalance for rough walls. The friction Reynolds number, $Re_\\tau$, varies\nbetween $3000$ and $27000$, depending both on the surface conditions and the\nfreestream velocity ensuring sufficient scale separation. Results align with\nprevious findings, showing that adverse pressure gradients just upstream of the\nmeasurement location increase wake strength and reduce the local skin friction\nwhile favourable pressure gradients suppress the wake and increase skin\nfriction. The roughness length scale, $y_0$, remains constant across different\npressure gradient histories for rough wall boundary layers. Inspired by\nprevious works, a new correlation is proposed to infer skin friction based on\nthe mean flow. The difference in skin friction between an arbitrary pressure\ngradient history and zero pressure gradient condition can be predicted using\nonly the local wake strength parameter ($\\Pi$), and the variations in wake\nstrength for different histories are related to a weighted integral of the\npressure gradient history normalised by local quantities. This allows us to\ndevelop a general correlation that can be used to infer skin friction for\nturbulent boundary layers experiencing arbitrary pressure-gradient histories.",

We\naccomplish this by establishing the Benford measure for continuous & bounded\ndomains, generalizing the accumulated percentage differences between sites in\nthe frequency data with the log-determinant of 'Benford Matrices,' employing an\nestimator to determine a 'Benford Test Statistic,' and identifying maximal\nvalues of that test statistic across all permutations of included sites in our\ndata. This framework is intended to complement outlier analysis models by\nfinding where hidden Benford patterns 'break' in frequency data and telling\ninvestigators which sites they should investigate.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between language and thought remains an unresolved\nphilosophical issue. Existing viewpoints can be broadly categorized into two\nschools: one asserting their independence, and another arguing that language\nconstrains thought. In the context of large language models, this debate raises\na crucial question: Does a language model's grasp of semantic meaning depend on\nthought processes? To explore this issue, we investigate whether reasoning\ntechniques can facilitate semantic understanding. Specifically, we\nconceptualize thought as reasoning, employ chain-of-thought prompting as a\nreasoning technique, and examine its impact on sentiment analysis tasks. The\nexperiments show that chain-of-thought has a minimal impact on sentiment\nanalysis tasks. Both the standard and chain-of-thought prompts focus on aspect\nterms rather than sentiment in the generated content. Furthermore,\ncounterfactual experiments reveal that the model's handling of sentiment tasks\nprimarily depends on information from demonstrations. The experimental results\nsupport the first viewpoint.",

However, ViT processes images by performing\npatch embedding, which inevitably introduces noise in patches and may\ncompromise the performance of the re-identification model. On the other hand,\nprevious memory bank based contrastive methods may lead data inconsistency due\nto the limitation of batch size.

Conventional approaches to synthesizing the learning\nalgorithm solve an inverse problem to infer the human's cost. However, these\nproblems can be ill-posed, hard to solve, or sensitive to problem data. Here we\nshow a game-theoretic learning algorithm that works solely by observing human\nactions to find the cost minimum, avoiding the need to solve an inverse\nproblem. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in an extensive set of\nhuman subjects experiments, demonstrating consistent convergence to the minimum\nof a prescribed human cost function in scalar and multidimensional\ninstantiations of the game. We conclude by outlining future directions for\ntheoretical and empirical extensions of our results.",

We first derive quantum solutions of the system\ndescribed with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of\ncoordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with\nnoncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the\nsystem with time-dependent parameters.

While the left and right\ncircular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal\nmanagement of the basic stationary system, the Schr\\\"odinger equation of the\nnonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and\nthe invariant-related unitary transformation procedure.

While the neural basis of this illusion has remained elusive,\nrecent psychophysical studies [1] reveal that this illusion induces not only a\nperceptual effect but also physiological responses, such as pupil dilation.\nThis paper presents a computational model based on Difference of Gaussians\n(DoG) filtering and a classical receptive field (CRF) implementation to\nsimulate early retinal processing and to explain the underlying mechanisms of\nthis illusion. Based on our results we hypothesize that the illusion arises\nfrom contrast-dependent lateral inhibition in early visual processing.

However, a yet-unexplored challenge is generating a sequence of\nprocedural images based on cooking steps from a recipe. This could enhance the\ncooking experience with visual guidance and possibly lead to an intelligent\ncooking simulation system. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel task called\n\\textbf{cooking procedural image generation}. This task is inherently\ndemanding, as it strives to create photo-realistic images that align with\ncooking steps while preserving sequential consistency. To collectively tackle\nthese challenges, we present \\textbf{CookingDiffusion}, a novel approach that\nleverages Stable Diffusion and three innovative Memory Nets to model procedural\nprompts. These prompts encompass text prompts (representing cooking steps),\nimage prompts (corresponding to cooking images), and multi-modal prompts\n(mixing cooking steps and images), ensuring the consistent generation of\ncooking procedural images. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\npreprocess the YouCookII dataset, establishing a new benchmark. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our model excels at generating\nhigh-quality cooking procedural images with remarkable consistency across\nsequential cooking steps, as measured by both the FID and the proposed Average\nProcedure Consistency metrics.

We generate inputs using English, Italian, Japanese, or nonce\nwords, varying the underlying grammars to conform to either hierarchical or\nlinear/positional rules. Using these grammars, we first observe that language\nmodels show distinct behaviors on hierarchical versus linearly structured\ninputs.

In this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based\nmetrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding\nground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of\nFOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator\nand text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric\nsensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics\nagainst LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity\nin the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation\naffects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL\nmetric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between\nBertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation.\nAdditionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and\nsensitivity compared to using individual metrics.",

Network traffic, which serves as a crucial data\ncarrier of network activities, has become indispensable in this process.\nNetwork traffic detection aims to monitor, analyze, and evaluate the data flows\ntransmitted across the network to ensure network security and optimize\nperformance. However, existing network traffic detection methods generally\nsuffer from several limitations: 1) a narrow focus on characterizing traffic\nfeatures from a single perspective; 2) insufficient exploration of\ndiscriminative features for different traffic; 3) poor generalization to\ndifferent traffic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a multi-view\ncorrelation-aware framework named FlowID for network traffic detection. FlowID\ncaptures multi-view traffic features via temporal and interaction awareness,\nwhile a hypergraph encoder further explores higher-order relationships between\nflows. To overcome the challenges of data imbalance and label scarcity, we\ndesign a dual-contrastive proxy task, enhancing the framework's ability to\ndifferentiate between various traffic flows through traffic-to-traffic and\ngroup-to-group contrast.

Traditional methods for\nassessing motor imitation are subjective, labor-intensive, and require\nextensive human training. Modern Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation\n(CAMI) methods, such as CAMI-3D for motion capture data and CAMI-2D for video\ndata, are less subjective. However, they rely on labor-intensive data\nnormalization and cleaning techniques, and human annotations for algorithm\ntraining. To address these challenges, we propose CAMI-2DNet, a scalable and\ninterpretable deep learning-based approach to motor imitation assessment in\nvideo data, which eliminates the need for data normalization, cleaning and\nannotation. CAMI-2DNet uses an encoder-decoder architecture to map a video to a\nmotion encoding that is disentangled from nuisance factors such as body shape\nand camera views. To learn a disentangled representation, we employ synthetic\ndata generated by motion retargeting of virtual characters through the\nreshuffling of motion, body shape, and camera views, as well as real\nparticipant data. To automatically assess how well an individual imitates an\nactor, we compute a similarity score between their motion encodings, and use it\nto discriminate individuals with ASCs from neurotypical (NT) individuals. Our\ncomparative analysis demonstrates that CAMI-2DNet has a strong correlation with\nhuman scores while outperforming CAMI-2D in discriminating ASC vs NT children.\nMoreover, CAMI-2DNet performs comparably to CAMI-3D while offering greater\npracticality by operating directly on video data and without the need for\nad-hoc data normalization and human annotations.",

In addition, we introduce a conceptually novel idea, called\ncoupling renormalization, which extends the notion of self-energy\nrenormalization. While this phenomenon is well-known in quantum field theory,\nit is identified here for the first time in the context of random Schr\\\"odinger\noperators.

(1) The\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is reconstructed from scratch in the real field only,\nwithout referring to Newtonian mechanics nor optics. Only the very simple\nconditions such as the space-time translational symmetry and the conservation\nof flux and energy are imposed on the factorization of the density distribution\nin configuration space, giving rise to a two-dimensional real vector. On\nreturning to the original Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, the imaginary number arises\nnaturally. (2) Like the Langevin equation in a Brownian dynamics, we formulate\na single-event path dynamics in quantum mechanics, contrasting with the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger distribution function. The path thus attained is referred to as\none-world path, which represents, for instance, a path of a singly launched\nelectron in the double-slit experiment that leaves a spot at the measurement\nboard, while many of accumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern. We\nstart from the Feynman-Kac formula to draw a relation between a stochastic\ndynamics and the parabolic differential equations, to one of which the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is transformed. (3) To highlight the roles of the flux\nand energy conservation in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics, we build that the\nquantum Maupertuis-Hamilton principle, which reveals the symplectic structure\nin the parameter space.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of Gaussian\nShading, a prevalent watermarking technique, by integrating the Exact Diffusion\nInversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT) framework. While Gaussian Shading\ntraditionally embeds watermarks in a noise latent space, followed by iterative\ndenoising for image generation and noise addition for watermark recovery, its\ninversion process is not exact, leading to potential watermark distortion. We\npropose to leverage EDICT's ability to derive exact inverse mappings to refine\nthis process. Our method involves duplicating the watermark-infused noisy\nlatent and employing a reciprocal, alternating denoising and noising scheme\nbetween the two latents, facilitated by EDICT. This allows for a more precise\nreconstruction of both the image and the embedded watermark. Empirical\nevaluation on standard datasets demonstrates that our integrated approach\nyields a slight, yet statistically significant improvement in watermark\nrecovery fidelity. These results highlight the potential of EDICT to enhance\nexisting diffusion-based watermarking techniques by providing a more accurate\nand robust inversion mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to explore the synergy between EDICT and Gaussian Shading for digital\nwatermarking, opening new avenues for research in robust and high-fidelity\nwatermark embedding and extraction.",

We present LlamaRestTest, a novel approach that\nemploys two custom LLMs-created by fine-tuning and quantizing the Llama3-8B\nmodel using mined datasets of REST API example values and inter-parameter\ndependencies-to generate realistic test inputs and uncover inter-parameter\ndependencies during the testing process by analyzing server responses. We\nevaluated LlamaRestTest on 12 real-world services (including popular services\nsuch as Spotify), comparing it against RESTGPT, a GPT-powered\nspecification-enhancement tool, as well as several state-of-the-art REST API\ntesting tools, including RESTler, MoRest, EvoMaster, and ARAT-RL. Our results\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning enables smaller models to outperform much larger\nmodels in detecting actionable parameter-dependency rules and generating valid\ninputs for REST API testing. We also evaluated different tool configurations,\nranging from the base Llama3-8B model to fine-tuned versions, and explored\nmultiple quantization techniques, including 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit integer\nformats. Our study shows that small language models can perform as well as, or\nbetter than, large language models in REST API testing, balancing effectiveness\nand efficiency. Furthermore, LlamaRestTest outperforms state-of-the-art REST\nAPI testing tools in code coverage achieved and internal server errors\nidentified, even when those tools use RESTGPT-enhanced specifications.",

    "abstract": "In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting\nrules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting\nrule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head\nmargins of victory or loss between candidates, then the voting rule yields the\nsame outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural\ninvariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative\naxiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question\nfor voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a\nranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is\nmargin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative\ncontent. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two\nvoters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either\nvoter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on\nthe election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's\npreference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and consistent feature computation is crucial for a wide range of\nonline ML applications. Typically, feature computation is divided into two\ndistinct phases, i.e., offline stage for model training and online stage for\nmodel serving. These phases often rely on execution engines with different\ninterface languages and function implementations, causing significant\ninconsistencies. Moreover, many online ML features involve complex time-series\ncomputations (e.g., functions over varied-length table windows) that differ\nfrom standard streaming and analytical queries. Existing data processing\nsystems (e.g., Spark, Flink, DuckDB) often incur multi-second latencies for\nthese computations, making them unsuitable for real-time online ML applications\nthat demand timely feature updates.\n  This paper presents OpenMLDB, a feature computation system deployed in\n4Paradigm's SageOne platform and over 100 real scenarios. Technically, OpenMLDB\nfirst employs a unified query plan generator for consistent computation results\nacross the offline and online stages, significantly reducing feature deployment\noverhead. Second, OpenMLDB provides an online execution engine that resolves\nperformance bottlenecks caused by long window computations (via\npre-aggregation) and multi-table window unions (via data self-adjusting). It\nalso provides a high-performance offline execution engine with window parallel\noptimization and time-aware data skew resolving. Third, OpenMLDB features a\ncompact data format and stream-focused indexing to maximize memory usage and\naccelerate data access. Evaluations in testing and real workloads reveal\nsignificant performance improvements and resource savings compared to the\nbaseline systems. The open community of OpenMLDB now has over 150 contributors\nand gained 1.6k stars on GitHub.",

Despite recent fine-tuning\napproaches successfully expanding context lengths, their high memory\nfootprints, especially for activations, present a critical practical\nlimitation. Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods prioritize reducing\nparameter update overhead over addressing activation memory constraints.\nSimilarly, existing sparsity mechanisms improve computational efficiency but\noverlook activation memory optimization due to the phenomenon of Shadowy\nActivation.\n  In this paper, we propose LeMo, the first LLM fine-tuning system that\nexplores and exploits a new token-level sparsity mechanism inherent in\nlong-context scenarios, termed Contextual Token Sparsity. LeMo minimizes\nredundant token involvement by assessing the informativeness of token\nembeddings while preserving model accuracy. Specifically, LeMo introduces three\nkey techniques: (1) Token Elimination, dynamically identifying and excluding\nredundant tokens across varying inputs and layers. (2) Pattern Prediction,\nutilizing well-trained predictors to approximate token sparsity patterns with\nminimal overhead. (3) Kernel Optimization, employing permutation-free and\nsegment-based strategies to boost system performance. We implement LeMo as an\nend-to-end fine-tuning system compatible with various LLM architectures and\nother optimization techniques.

    "abstract": "Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we have devised a method of\nsensing the microscopic surface conditions on the surface of niobium as it is\nundergoing an electrochemical polishing (EP) treatment. The method uses\nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to gather information on the\nsurface state of the electrode without disrupting the polishing reaction. The\nEIS data is analyzed using a so-called distribution of relaxation times (DRT)\nmethod. Using DRT, the EIS data can be deconvolved into discrete relaxation\ntime peaks without any a priori knowledge of the electrode dynamics. By\nanalyzing the relaxation time peaks, we are able to distinguish two distinct\nmodes of the EP reaction. As the polishing voltage is increased, the electrode\ntransitions from the low voltage EP mode, characterized by a single relaxation\ntime peaks, to the high voltage EP mode, characterized by two relaxation time\npeaks. We theorize that this second peak is caused by the formation of an oxide\nlayer on the electrode. We also find that this oxide induced peak transitions\nfrom to a negative relaxation time, which is indicative of a blocking electrode\nprocess. By analyzing EPed samples, we show that samples polished in the low\nvoltage mode have significantly higher surface roughness due to grain etching\nand faceting. We find that the surface roughness of the samples only improves\nwhen the oxide film peak is present and in the negative relaxation time region.\nThis shows that EIS combined with DRT analysis can be used to predict etching\non EPed Nb. This method can also be performed before or during the EP, which\ncould allow for adjustment of polishing parameters to guarantee a smooth cavity\nsurface finish.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of computer vision, Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET) is\nincreasingly replacing the traditional paradigm of pre-training followed by\nfull fine-tuning. PET is particularly favored for its effectiveness in large\nfoundation models, as it streamlines transfer learning costs and optimizes\nhardware utilization. However, the current PET methods are mainly designed for\nsingle-modal optimization. While some pioneering studies have undertaken\npreliminary explorations, they still remain at the level of aligned encoders\n(e.g., CLIP) and lack exploration of misaligned encoders. These methods show\nsub-optimal performance with misaligned encoders, as they fail to effectively\nalign the multimodal features during fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce\nDETRIS, a parameter-efficient tuning framework designed to enhance low-rank\nvisual feature propagation by establishing dense interconnections between each\nlayer and all preceding layers, which enables effective cross-modal feature\ninteraction and adaptation to misaligned encoders. We also suggest using text\nadapters to improve textual features.

We also find that the fraction of total stellar mass created in the last\n200 Myr is ~1.3 times higher in LAEs than in mass-matched Lyman Break Galaxy\n(LBG) samples, and that a majority of LBGs are experiencing dominant bursts,\nreaffirming that LAEs differ from other star forming galaxies.

    "abstract": "Network control theory (NCT) has recently been utilized in neuroscience to\nfacilitate our understanding of brain stimulation effects. A particularly\nuseful branch of NCT is optimal control, which focuses on applying theoretical\nand computational principles of control theory to design optimal strategies to\nachieve specific goals in neural processes. However, most existing research\nfocuses on optimally controlling brain network dynamics from the original state\nto a target state at a specific time point. In this paper, we present the first\ninvestigation of introducing optimal stochastic tracking control strategy to\nsynchronize the dynamics of the brain network to a target dynamics rather than\nto a target state at a specific time point. We utilized fMRI data from healthy\ngroups, and cases of stroke and post-stroke aphasia. For all participants, we\nutilized a gradient descent optimization method to estimate the parameters for\nthe brain network dynamic system. We then utilized optimal stochastic tracking\ncontrol techniques to drive original unhealthy dynamics by controlling a\ncertain number of nodes to synchronize with target healthy dynamics. Results\nshow that the energy associated with optimal stochastic tracking control is\nnegatively correlated with the intrinsic average controllability of the brain\nnetwork system, while the energy of the optimal state approaching control is\nsignificantly related to the target state value. For a 100-dimensional brain\nnetwork system, controlling the five nodes with the lowest tracking energy can\nachieve relatively acceptable dynamics control effects. Our results suggest\nthat stochastic tracking control is more aligned with the objective of brain\nstimulation interventions, and is closely related to the intrinsic\ncharacteristics of the brain network system, potentially representing a new\ndirection for future brain network optimal control research.",

DualOpt combines two\ncomplementary strategies to improve both solution quality and computational\nefficiency.

The\nprocess continues until only one grid remains, yielding a high-quality initial\nsolution.

    "abstract": "The softmax function is a cornerstone of multi-class classification, integral\nto a wide range of machine learning applications, from large-scale retrieval\nand ranking models to advanced large language models. However, its\ncomputational cost grows linearly with the number of classes, which becomes\nprohibitively expensive in scenarios with millions or even billions of classes.\nThe sampled softmax, which relies on self-normalized importance sampling, has\nemerged as a powerful alternative, significantly reducing computational\ncomplexity. Yet, its estimator remains unbiased only when the sampling\ndistribution matches the true softmax distribution. To improve both\napproximation accuracy and sampling efficiency, we propose the MIDX Sampler, a\nnovel adaptive sampling strategy based on an inverted multi-index approach.\nConcretely, we decompose the softmax probability into several multinomial\nprobabilities, each associated with a specific set of codewords and the last\nassociated with the residual score of queries, thus reducing time complexity to\nthe number of codewords instead of the number of classes. To further boost\nefficiency, we replace the query-specific residual probability with a simple\nuniform distribution, simplifying the computation while retaining high\nperformance. Our method is backed by rigorous theoretical analysis, addressing\nkey concerns such as sampling bias, gradient bias, convergence rates, and\ngeneralization error bounds. The results demonstrate that a smaller divergence\nfrom the ideal softmax distribution leads to faster convergence and improved\ngeneralization.

    "abstract": "We have newly developed a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier that can be used\nin a gas time projection chamber (TPC). A TPC requires a high voltage to form\nan electric field that drifts ionization electrons. Supplying the high voltage\nfrom outside the pressure vessel requires a dedicated high-voltage feedthrough.\nAn alternative approach is to generate the high voltage inside the pressure\nvessel with a relatively low voltage introduced from outside. A CW multiplier\ncan convert a low AC voltage input to a high DC voltage output, making it\nsuitable for this purpose.\n  We have integrated a CW multiplier into the AXEL (A Xenon ElectroLuminescence\ndetector), a high pressure xenon gas TPC to search for neutrinoless double beta\ndecay of $^{136}$Xe. It uses silicon photomultipliers to detect the ionization\nelectrons through elecrtoluminescence, making it strong against electronic\nnoise. Operation of the CW multiplier was successfully demonstrated; the TPC\nwas operated for 40 days at 6.8 bar, and an energy resolution as high as (0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.08) % (FWHM) at 2615 keV was obtained.",

Advanced face swapping methods have achieved attractive results.\nHowever, these methods often inadvertently transfer identity information from\nthe target face, compromising expression-related details and accurate identity.\nWe propose a novel method DynamicFace that leverages the power of diffusion\nmodels and plug-and-play adaptive attention layers for image and video face\nswapping. First, we introduce four fine-grained facial conditions using 3D\nfacial priors. All conditions are designed to be disentangled from each other\nfor precise and unique control.

Through experiments on the FF++\ndataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in\nface swapping, showcasing superior image quality, identity preservation, and\nexpression accuracy.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is essential for comprehending images, but the process\nnecessitates a substantial amount of detailed annotations at the pixel level.\nAcquiring such annotations can be costly in the real-world. Unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is a technique that uses virtual\ndata with labels to train a model and adapts it to real data without labels.\nSome recent works use contrastive learning, which is a powerful method for\nself-supervised learning, to help with this technique. However, these works do\nnot take into account the diversity of features within each class when using\ncontrastive learning, which leads to errors in class prediction. We analyze the\nlimitations of these works and propose a novel framework called Pseudo-label\nGuided Pixel Contrast (PGPC), which overcomes the disadvantages of previous\nmethods. We also investigate how to use more information from target images\nwithout adding noise from pseudo-labels. We test our method on two standard UDA\nbenchmarks and show that it outperforms existing methods. Specifically, we\nachieve relative improvements of 5.1% mIoU and 4.6% mIoU on the Grand Theft\nAuto V (GTA5) to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes tasks based on DAFormer,\nrespectively.

In this paper,\nfollowing the philosophy behind that work, we investigate two questions,\nnamely, for every concept class: (1) What are the minimal assumptions on the\ndata process admitting online learnability? (2) Is there a learning algorithm\nwhich succeeds under every data process satisfying the minimal assumptions?\nSuch an algorithm is said to be optimistically universal for the given concept\nclass. We resolve both of these questions for all concept classes, and\nmoreover, as part of our solution, we design general learning algorithms for\neach case. Finally, we extend these algorithms and results to the agnostic\ncase, showing an equivalence between the minimal assumptions on the data\nprocess for learnability in the agnostic and realizable cases, for every\nconcept class, as well as the equivalence of optimistically universal\nlearnability.",

Existing approximation\ntechniques in training can mitigate the overheads but, in serving, still lead\nto high latency and/or accuracy loss. To this end, we propose OMEGA, a system\nthat enables low-latency GNN serving for large graphs with minimal accuracy\nloss through two key ideas. First, OMEGA employs selective recomputation of\nprecomputed embeddings, which allows for reusing precomputed computation\nsubgraphs while selectively recomputing a small fraction to minimize accuracy\nloss.

Traditionally\nutilized to study space photonic crystals, topological band theory has also\nbeen translated recently to analyze time photonic crystals with time inversion\nsymmetry, enabling the construction of the temporal version of topological edge\nstates. However, temporal disorder can readily break time inversion symmetry in\npractice, hence likely destroying the edge states associated with this type of\ntime photonic crystals. To overcome this limitation, here we propose a new\nclass of time photonic crystals presenting chiral symmetry instead, whose edge\nstates exhibit superior robustness over the time-reversal-symmetry-protected\ncounterparts. Our time photonic crystal is equivalent to a temporal version of\nthe Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the chiral symmetry of this type of time\nphotonic crystals quantizes the winding number defined in the Bloch frequency\nband. Remarkably, random temporal disorders do not impact the eigenfrequencies\nof these chiral-symmetry-protected edge states, while instead enhancing their\ntemporal localizations. Our findings thus provide a promising paradigm to\ncontrol field amplification with exceptional robustness as well as being a\nfeasible platform to investigate various topological phases in time-varying\nmedia.",

Both galaxies demonstrate ongoing\nstar formation, evidenced by $FUV$ and $H\\alpha$ observations. NGC 7734 shows\nrecent star formation along its bar, while NGC 7733 experiences bar quenching.\nThe star formation rate (SFR) analysis of NGC 7734 reveals that the bar\nregion's SFR dominates the galaxy's overall SFR.

However, the hypothesis that these PBHs formed through the\nenhancement of the primordial curvature perturbations has consistently faced\nsignificant challenges due to the stringent constraints imposed by\n$\\mu$-distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we\ninvestigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on $\\mu$-distortion constraint in the\ncontext of broad power spectra.

The six dual quasars have redshifts ranging from 0.58 to\n3.28 and projected separations ranging from 15.44 to 22.54 kpc, with a mean\nseparation of 17.95 kpc. The eleven projected quasars have projected\nseparations ranging from 10.96 to 39.07 kpc, with a mean separation of 22.64\nkpc. Additionally, there are three likely lensed quasars that cannot be\ndefinitively confirmed, contributed by two reasons. Firstly, their image\nseparations (0.83'', 0.98'', and 0.93'') are small compared to the seeing\nconditions during our observations (around 1.2''). Secondly, no high SNR\nlensing galaxy can be detected in the Legacy Survey Imaging. Better\nspectroscopy and (or) imaging are needed to confirm their lensing nature.",

    "abstract": "Network-assisted congestion control leveraging Explicit Congestion\nNotification (ECN) is an effective way to deal with congestion issues on the\nInternet. However, we believe that the existing ECN mechanism in the TCP/IP\nprotocol stack may require further optimization to effectively address the\nevolving congestion challenges introduced by emerging technologies like\nimmersive AR/VR applications and the burgeoning field of the Internet of Things\n(IoT). To that end, we propose a multilevel congestion notification mechanism\ncalled Enhanced ECN (EECN) that leverages the existing two ECN bits in the IP\nheader to notify two levels of congestion in the network and uses the\ncorresponding two bits in the TCP header to negotiate EECN during the handshake\nand echo congestion experienced back to the sender. Additionally, we propose a\ncongestion control mechanism that triggers different congestion control\nresponses based on the average RTT and multilevel congestion feedback received\nfrom the network, which yields promising results, highlighting the\neffectiveness of utilizing multilevel congestion feedback. The proposed EECN\nmechanism reduces packet drop by 70% compared to ECN, by 95% compared to TCP\nNew Reno without ECN, and by 40% compared to VCP. The packets marked are\nreduced by 96% compared to ECN and 76% compared to VCP.

As a result,\nexisting methods for pure NF or FF localization are no longer applicable. We\nconsider a hybrid NF and FF localization scenario in this paper, where a base\nstation (BS) locates multiple users in both NF and FF regions with the aid of a\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which is a low-cost implementation of\nHMIMO. In such a scenario, it is difficult to locate the users and optimize the\nRIS phase shifts because whether the location of the user is in the NF or FF\nregion is unknown, and the channels of different users are coupled. To tackle\nthis challenge, we propose a RIS-enabled localization method that searches the\nusers in both NF and FF regions and tackles the coupling issue by jointly\nestimating all user locations. We derive the localization error bound by\nconsidering the channel coupling and propose an RIS phase shift optimization\nalgorithm that minimizes the derived bound.

    "abstract": "We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the\nJWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We\nfocus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce\nmaps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n(PAHs) in the inner $\\sim$50 kpc of the cluster. We measure the optical depth\nfrom silicates by comparing the observed H$_2$ line ratios to those predicted\nby excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular\ngas mass of $1.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \\times 10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$ which agrees with\nCO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor\nof $\\alpha_{\\rm CO} = 0.8 \\pm 0.2\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}\\,({\\rm K}\\,{\\rm\nkm}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1})^{-1}$; an updated stellar mass of $M_* = 2.6 \\pm 0.5 \\times\n10^{10}$ $M_\\odot$; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of\n$\\langle{\\rm SFR}\\rangle_{\\rm 10} = 1340 \\pm 100$ $M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, and\n$\\langle{\\rm SFR}\\rangle_{\\rm 100} = 740 \\pm 80$ $M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\nrespectively. The H$_2$ emission seems to be powered predominantly by shocks\nand star formation within the central $\\sim 20$ kpc, induced by stellar\nfeedback and radio jets from the active galactic nucleus. Additionally, we find\nnearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH\nfluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot\nparticles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the\ncentralmost 10s of kpc.",

However, most FL studies ignore the crucial challenge of\nheterogeneous domains where each client has a distinct feature distribution,\nwhich is popular in real-world scenarios. Prototype learning, which leverages\nthe mean feature vectors within the same classes, has become a prominent\nsolution for federated learning under domain shift. However, existing federated\nprototype learning methods focus soley on inter-domain prototypes and neglect\nintra-domain perspectives.

    "abstract": "In photometric observations, the flux averaged over the preset exposure time\nis usually used as the representation of an object's true flux at the middle of\nthe exposure interval. For the study of transients and variables, it is also\nthe default manner to build the light curves. In this work, we investigate the\neffect of this common practice on quantifying the photometric light curves. Our\nanalysis shows that the flux averaged over the exposure time is not necessarily\nidentical to the true flux so that potential bias may be introduced. The\noverall profile of the true light curve tends to be flattened by the exposure\ntime. In addition, it is found that the peak position and photometric color can\nalso be altered. We then discuss the impacts of the bias induced by exposure\ntime on the light curves of stellar flares, periodic stars, and active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs). The bias can lead to an underestimate of the total fluxes of\nstellar flares which has been noticed in the observational data. For periodic\nstars that follow a sinusoidal light curve, the bias does not affect the period\nand peak position, but can result in the peak flux being underestimated.\nMeanwhile, the bias can result in steeper structure function at short\ntimescales for AGN light curves. To obtain unbiased physical parameter\nestimates from the light curves, our analysis indicates that it is essential to\naccount for this bias, particularly for transients and variables with very\nshort timescales.",

In\norder to understand the characteristics of fake news video explanation, we\nconducted an exploratory analysis of FakeVE from different perspectives.

In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false\ninformation in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will\ncompromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we\npropose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure\ntruthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully\ndistributed setting, where no \"centralized\" aggregator exists to collect\nprivate information/decision variables from participating agents. We\nsystematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under\nnonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes\nexisting distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex\nobjective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between\nconvergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different\nconvexity conditions.

It is a\nfundamental element underlying all of star and galaxy formation, and has been\nthe subject of extensive investigation for more than 60 years. In the past few\ndecades there has been a growing, and now substantial, body of evidence\nsupporting the need for a variable IMF. In this light, it is crucial to\ninvestigate the IMF's characteristics across different spatial scales and to\nunderstand the factors driving its variability. We make use of spatially\nresolved spectroscopy to examine the high-mass IMF slope of star-forming\ngalaxies within the SAMI survey. By applying the Kennicutt method and stellar\npopulation synthesis models, we estimated both the spaxel-resolved\n($\\alpha_{res}$) and galaxy-integrated ($\\alpha_{int}$) high-mass IMF slopes of\nthese galaxies. Our findings indicate that the resolved and integrated IMF\nslopes exhibit a near 1:1 relationship for $\\alpha_{int}> -2.7$. We observe a\nwide range of $\\alpha_{res}$ distributions within galaxies. To explore the\nsources of this variability, we analyse the relationships between the resolved\nand integrated IMF slopes and both the star formation rate (SFR) and SFR\nsurface density ($\\Sigma_{SFR}$). Our results reveal a strong correlation where\nflatter/steeper slopes are associated with higher/lower SFR and $\\Sigma_{SFR}$.\nThis trend is qualitatively similar for resolved and global scales.\nAdditionally, we identify a mass dependency in the relationship with SFR,\nthough none was found in the relation between the resolved slope and\n$\\Sigma_{SFR}$. These findings suggest an scenario where the formation of\nhigh-mass stars is favoured in regions with more concentrated star formation.\nThis may be a consequence of the reduced fragmentation of molecular clouds,\nwhich nonetheless accrete more material.",

We then explore the impact of fine-tuning Whisper on the\nperformance in the two UK regions and investigate the effectiveness of existing\nmodel evaluation techniques for our real-world application through manual\ninspection of model errors. We observe that the Whisper model has a higher word\nerror rate (WER) on our test datasets compared to the baseline data and\nfine-tuning on a given data improves performance on the test dataset with the\nsame domain and accent. The fine-tuned models also appear to show improved\nperformance when applied to the test data outside of the region it was trained\non suggesting that fine-tuned models may be transferable within parts of the\nUK. Our manual analysis of model outputs reveals the benefits and drawbacks of\nusing WER as an evaluation metric and fine-tuning to adapt to regional\ndialects.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in scientific machine\nlearning, especially when surrogate models are used to approximate complex\nsystems. Although multilayer perceptions (MLPs) are commonly employed as\nsurrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of\nparameters. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution\nwith fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when\napplied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of\nback-propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach,\ncombining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion (DTEKI) with Chebyshev\nKANs. This gradient-free method effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances\nnumerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to\nreduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy\nof predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases,\nincluding scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results show\nthat the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy, much higher\nefficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability.\nMoreover, by leveraging the low-dimensional parameter subspace, our method\npreserves prediction accuracy while substantially reducing further the\ncomputational cost.",

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity and volume of network data demand effective\nanalysis approaches, with visual exploration proving particularly beneficial.\nImmersive technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and large\ndisplay walls, have enabled the emerging field of immersive analytics, offering\nnew opportunities to enhance user engagement, spatial awareness, and\nproblem-solving. A growing body of work has explored immersive environments for\nnetwork visualisation, ranging from design studies to fully integrated\napplications across various domains. Despite these advancements, the field\nremains fragmented, lacking a clear description of the design space and a\nstructured overview of the aspects that have already been empirically\nevaluated. To address this gap, we present a survey of visual network analysis\nin immersive environments, covering 138 publications retrieved through a\nstructured pipeline. We systematically analyse the key aspects that define the\ndesign space, investigate their coverage in prior applications (n=87), and\nreview user evaluations (n=59) that provide empirical evidence for essential\ndesign-related questions. By synthesising experimental findings and evaluating\nexisting applications, we identify key achievements, highlight research gaps,\nand offer guidance for the design of future approaches. Additionally, we\nprovide an online resource to explore our results interactively, which will be\nupdated as new developments emerge.",

    "abstract": "A common assumption in the literature on information diffusion is that\npopulations are homogeneous regarding individuals' information acquisition and\npropagation process: Individuals update their informed and actively\ncommunicating state either through imitation (simple contagion) or peer\ninfluence (complex contagion). Here, we study the impact of the mixing and\nplacement of individuals with different update processes on how information\ncascades in social networks. We consider Simple Spreaders, which take\ninformation from a random neighbor and communicate it, and Threshold-based\nSpreaders, which require a threshold number of active neighbors to change their\nstate to active communication. Even though, in a population made exclusively of\nSimple Spreaders, information reaches all elements of any (connected) network,\nwe show that, when Simple and Threshold-based Spreaders coexist and occupy\nrandom positions in a social network, the number of Simple Spreaders\nsystematically amplifies the cascades only in degree heterogeneous networks\n(exponential and scale-free). In random and modular structures, this cascading\neffect originated by Simple Spreaders only exists above a critical mass of\nthese individuals. In contrast, when Threshold-based Spreaders are assorted\npreferentially in the nodes with a higher degree, the cascading effect of\nSimple Spreaders vanishes, and the spread of information is drastically\nimpaired. Overall, the study highlights the significance of the strategic\nplacement of different roles in networked structures, with Simple Spreaders\ndriving widespread cascades in heterogeneous networks and Threshold-based\nSpreaders playing a critical regulatory role in information spread with a\ntunable effect based on the threshold value.",

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical\ndiagnostics necessitates a critical examination of its ethical and practical\nimplications. While the prioritization of diagnostic accuracy, as advocated by\nSabuncu et al. (2025), is essential, this approach risks oversimplifying\ncomplex socio-ethical issues, including fairness, privacy, and\nintersectionality. This rebuttal emphasizes the dangers of reducing\nmultifaceted health disparities to quantifiable metrics and advocates for a\nmore transdisciplinary approach. By incorporating insights from social\nsciences, ethics, and public health, AI systems can address the compounded\neffects of intersecting identities and safeguard sensitive data.
