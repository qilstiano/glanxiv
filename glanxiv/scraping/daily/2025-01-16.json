    "abstract": "This paper presents a semi-supervised approach to extracting narratives from\nhistorical photographic records using an adaptation of the narrative maps\nalgorithm. We extend the original unsupervised text-based method to work with\nimage data, leveraging deep learning techniques for visual feature extraction\nand similarity computation. Our method is applied to the ROGER dataset, a\ncollection of photographs from the 1928 Sacambaya Expedition in Bolivia\ncaptured by Robert Gerstmann. We compare our algorithmically extracted visual\nnarratives with expert-curated timelines of varying lengths (5 to 30 images) to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we use the Dynamic\nTime Warping (DTW) algorithm to match the extracted narratives with the\nexpert-curated baseline. In addition, we asked an expert on the topic to\nqualitatively evaluate a representative example of the resulting narratives.\nOur findings show that the narrative maps approach generally outperforms random\nsampling for longer timelines (10+ images, p < 0.05), with expert evaluation\nconfirming the historical accuracy and coherence of the extracted narratives.\nThis research contributes to the field of computational analysis of visual\ncultural heritage, offering new tools for historians, archivists, and digital\nhumanities scholars to explore and understand large-scale image collections.\nThe method's ability to generate meaningful narratives from visual data opens\nup new possibilities for the study and interpretation of historical events\nthrough photographic evidence.",

This\nunique shape is mainly caused by the movement of the galaxy within a cluster,\nduring which the radio jets are deflected by the intra-cluster medium. A\ncombined method, which involves a deep learning-based radio source finder along\nwith visual inspection, has been utilized to search for BTRGs from the Faint\nImages of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey images. Consequently, a\ncatalog of 4876 BTRGs has been constructed, among which 3871 are newly\ndiscovered. Based on the classification scheme of the opening angle between the\ntwo jets of the galaxy, BTRGs are typically classified as either\nwide-angle-tail (WAT) sources or narrow-angle-tail (NAT) sources. Our catalog\ncomprises 4424 WATs and 652 NATs. Among these, optical counterparts are\nidentified for 4193 BTRGs.

    "abstract": "Many close-in multiple-planet systems show a peas-in-a-pod trend, where\nneighbouring planets have similar sizes, masses, and orbital spacing. Others,\nincluding the Solar System, have a more diverse size and mass distribution.\nClassical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the\nlatter, and the origin of this difference remains unclear. Recent studies\nsuggest disc evolution is largely driven by magnetic winds rather than\nviscosity alone. In such wind-driven accretion discs, the mass accretion rate\nvaries radially instead of being constant, as in classical viscous discs. We\ninvestigate how the wind's efficiency in removing disc mass affects planet\nformation and migration. We performed single-core planet formation simulations\nvia pebble accretion in wind-driven accretion discs. We varied wind efficiency\nvia the magnetic lever arm parameter $ \\lambda $ and studied outcomes by\nconsidering a range of initial disc masses and accretion timescales. Our\nsimulations show that higher $ \\lambda $ discs, with less wind mass loss, lead\nto faster formation and migration, generating similar-mass planetary systems.\nLower $ \\lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more\ndiverse-mass planetary systems. A mass jump occurs for all $ \\lambda $ cases\nwhen planet formation and disc accretion timescales are comparable, but is\nlarger for lower $ \\lambda $ discs. Super-Earth systems with cold Jupiters form\nmore frequently in metal-rich discs, consistent with observations. Our\nsimulations suggest similar-mass and diverse-mass systems are approximately\nseparated at $ \\lambda \\sim 2\\text{--}3 $.",

We perform\noptical imaging experiments with MSR-1 MTB, and derive both the $m$ statistics\nand the scaling of $m$ with the MTB size using an explicit and fully automated\nmethod to determine $m$ from the MTB trajectories via the U-turn protocol,\nwhich measures $m$ based on the U-shaped trajectories exhibited by the MTB in\nan applied alternating magnetic field. The proposed method is an alternative to\nthe standard U-turn time-based moment calculation and uses the theoretical\nU-turn shape function we have derived. This directly accounts for the U-turn\ngeometry and determines the moment from the U-turn branch width. We couple this\napproach with a robust U-turn decomposition algorithm that detects U-turns from\nMTB tracks regardless of their orientations. We report a linear dependence of\n$m$ on the size of the bacteria, accounting for the bacteria velocity\nvariations during the U-turns. We also demonstrate that the new U-turn\nshape-based and the conventional time-based methods produce significantly\ndifferent results. The proposed method can be used to differentiate between\nvarious types of MTB within the same population based on their velocity and\nmagnetic moments, and to precisely characterize the magnetic properties of a\nculture.",

A key result is that the\nprojective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study\nthe simplest case of $\\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong\ninteraction) in detail.

In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical,\ngravitationally stratified, supernova (SNe)-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the\nnature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of velocity flux\ntransfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\\mathbf{u}_c$\nand incompressible $\\mathbf{u}_s$ modes, we show that there exists a\nlarge-to-small-scale cascade in both $\\mathbf{u}_c$ and $\\mathbf{u}_s$ when\nmediated by an additional $\\mathbf{u}_s$ mode.

The cascade feeds flux into scales\nwell beyond the scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct\ncascades. Both the strongly non-local and the inverse $\\mathbf{u}_s$ cascades\nhappen on scales that have a power law $\\mathbf{u}_s$ energy spectrum,\nhighlighting how degenerate the spectrum is to the true underlying physical\nprocesses.

Our models\npredict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent\nluminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and\nsignificant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to\nshadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and\npronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include\nultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction\nfactors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed\ncoronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain\nthe observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing\nangle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the\nbroad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion\nflows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can\nnaturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and\nprovide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.",

    "abstract": "To enhance decarbonization efforts in electric power systems, we propose a\nnovel electricity market clearing model that internalizes the allocation of\nemissions from generations to loads and allows for consideration of\nconsumer-side carbon costs. Specifically, consumers can not only bid for power\nbut also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity\nuse. These carbon costs provide consumers, ranging from carbon-agnostic to\ncarbon-sensitive, with a tool to actively manage their roles in carbon emission\nmitigation. By incorporating carbon allocation and consumer-side carbon costs,\nthe market clearing is influenced not solely by production and demand dynamics\nbut also by the allocation of carbon emission responsibilities. To demonstrate\nthe effect of our proposed model, we conduct a case study comparing market\nclearing outcomes across various percentages of carbon-sensitive consumers with\ndiffering carbon costs.",

The space where the feature\nvolumes are placed acts as a common ground for unifying input modalities. These\nfeature volumes are overlapped and rendered into feature images from novel\nperspectives using volumetric rendering techniques. The rendered feature images\nare used as conditioning inputs for a modality-specific diffusion model,\nenabling the synthesis of novel images for the desired output modality. In this\npaper, we show that jointly training different modules ensures consistent\ngeometric understanding across all modalities within the framework. We validate\nCrossModalityDiffusion's capabilities on the synthetic ShapeNet cars dataset,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in generating accurate and consistent novel\nviews across multiple imaging modalities and perspectives.",

The periodic modulations\nhave previously been attributed to planetary companion(s), precession, or\nmagnetospheric effects and have several interesting features: they persist over\n10 cycles, there are at least two harmonically related components, and the\nperiod is decreasing at a rate of about 5 days per cycle. PSR B1828-11 also\nexperienced a glitch, a sudden increase in its rotation frequency, at 55 040.9\nModified Julian Day(MJD). By studying the interaction of the periodic\nmodulations with the glitch, we seek to find evidence to distinguish\nexplanations of the periodic modulation. Using a phenomenological model, we\nanalyse a recently published open data set from Jodrell Bank Observatory,\nproviding the longest and highest resolution measurements of the pulsar's\nspin-down rate data. Our phenomenological model consists of step changes in the\namplitude, modulation frequency, and phase of the long-term periodic modulation\nand the usual spin-down glitch behaviour. We find clear evidence with a\n(natural-log) Bayes factor of 1486 to support that not only is there a change\nto these three separate parameters but that the shifts occur before the glitch.\nFinally, we also present model-independent evidence which demonstrates visually\nhow and when the modulation period and amplitude change.

To investigate theories of spheroidal galaxy formation, the objective\nof this work is to analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of\nthree isolated elliptical galaxies in the local Universe observed with MUSE at\n$z<0.06$. With BUDDI, we decompose the integral field unit (IFU) datacubes into\ntwo components with S\\'ersic profiles, which roughly correspond to the two\nphases of in-situ and ex-situ star formation. To constrain the mode of growth\nin these galaxies, we derived the mass and light-weighted stellar ages and\nmetallicities, and created the 2D stellar population maps of each component\nusing pPXF. We reconstructed the mass and light-weighted SFHs to constrain the\ncontribution of different stellar populations to the mass and luminosity of the\ncomponents through cosmic time. Our results show that the ellipticals in this\nsample have experienced an early and rapid phase of star formation either\nthrough a rapid dissipative collapse or gas-rich major mergers concentrated in\nthe inner component, which contributes to $\\sim50$% of the galaxy stellar mass.\nThe co-dominant outer component, however, had assembled the bulk of its stellar\nmass shortly after the inner component did, through accretion via dry mergers\nand possible gas accretion. This premise is supported by our observations of\nthe inner component being primarily composed of old and metal-rich stars. The\nouter component has a combination of old and intermediate-age stars, with a\nmoderate spread in metallicities. These results are analysed through the lens\nof the two-phase scenario, a framework developed over the years to explain the\nformation histories of elliptical galaxies.",

An intuitive alternative calls on guidance from in-the-wild\nimage exemplars to help users bring their imagined edits to life. Contemporary\nexemplar-based editing methods shy away from leveraging the rich latent space\nlearnt by pre-existing large text-to-image (TTI) models and fall back on\ntraining with curated objective functions to achieve the task. Though somewhat\neffective, this demands significant computational resources and lacks\ncompatibility with diverse base models and arbitrary exemplar count. On further\ninvestigation, we also find that these techniques restrict user control to only\napplying uniform global changes over the entire edited region. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel framework for progressive exemplar-driven editing with\noff-the-shelf diffusion models, dubbed PIXELS, to enable customization by\nproviding granular control over edits, allowing adjustments at the pixel or\nregion level. Our method operates solely during inference to facilitate\nimitative editing, enabling users to draw inspiration from a dynamic number of\nreference images, or multimodal prompts, and progressively incorporate all the\ndesired changes without retraining or fine-tuning existing TTI models. This\ncapability of fine-grained control opens up a range of new possibilities,\nincluding selective modification of individual objects and specifying gradual\nspatial changes. We demonstrate that PIXELS delivers high-quality edits\nefficiently, leading to a notable improvement in quantitative metrics as well\nas human evaluation. By making high-quality image editing more accessible,\nPIXELS has the potential to enable professional-grade edits to a wider audience\nwith the ease of using any open-source image generation model.",

An intriguing open problem is whether a\nrelativistic $n$-body system can be in stationary equilibrium. Due to the\nnonlinear effect of spin-spin repulsion of rotating objects, and possibly\nconsidering charged bodies with additional electromagnetic repulsion, the\nexistence of such unusual configurations remains a possibility. An important\nexample is a (hypothetical) equilibrium configuration with $n$ aligned black\nholes. By studying a linear matrix problem equivalent to the Einstein equations\nfor axisymmetric and stationary (electro-) vacuum spacetimes, we derive the\nmost general form of the boundary data on the symmetry axis in terms of a\nfinite number of parameters. In the simplest case $n=1$, this leads to a\nconstructive uniqueness proof of the Kerr (-Newman) solution. For $n=2$ and\nvacuum, we obtain non-existence of stationary two-black-hole configurations.\nFor $n=2$ with electrovacuum, and for larger $n$, it remains an open problem\nwhether the well-defined finite solution families contain any physically\nreasonable solutions, i.e.\\ spacetimes without anomalies such as naked\nsingularities, magnetic monopoles, and struts.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Federated Learning (FL) approaches often struggle with data\nheterogeneity across clients, leading to suboptimal model performance for\nindividual clients. To address this issue, Personalized Federated Learning\n(PFL) emerges as a solution to the challenges posed by non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) and unbalanced data across clients.\nFurthermore, in most existing decentralized machine learning works, a perfect\ncommunication channel is considered for model parameter transmission between\nclients and servers. However, decentralized PFL over wireless links introduces\nnew challenges, such as resource allocation and interference management. To\novercome these challenges, we formulate a joint optimization problem that\nincorporates the underlying device-to-device (D2D) wireless channel conditions\ninto a server-free PFL approach. The proposed method, dubbed pFedWN, optimizes\nthe learning performance for each client while accounting for the variability\nin D2D wireless channels. To tackle the formulated problem, we divide it into\ntwo sub-problems: PFL neighbor selection and PFL weight assignment. The PFL\nneighbor selection is addressed through channel-aware neighbor selection within\nunlicensed spectrum bands such as ISM bands. Next, to assign PFL weights, we\nutilize the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to evaluate the similarity\nbetween clients' data and obtain optimal weight distribution among the chosen\nPFL neighbors. Empirical results show that pFedWN provides efficient and\npersonalized learning performance with non-IID and unbalanced datasets.\nFurthermore, it outperforms the existing FL and PFL methods in terms of\nlearning efficacy and robustness, particularly under dynamic and unpredictable\nwireless channel conditions.",

To do so, the radar resource management problem is formulated and solved\nby employing the quality of service based resource allocation model (Q-RAM)\nframework. As active tracking tasks may be scheduled simultaneously, the\nresource allocation of tasks becomes dependent on the other tasks. The solution\nto the resource allocation problem is obtained by introducing the adaptive fast\ntraversal algorithm combined with a three dimensional strip packing algorithm\nto handle task dependencies.

We compute the\nZernike moments (ZMs) for GZ2 images, extracting unique and independent\ncharacteristics of galaxies. The uniqueness due to the orthogonality and\ncompleteness of Zernike polynomials, reconstruction of the original images with\nminimum errors, invariances (rotation, translation, and scaling), different\nblock structures, and discriminant decision boundaries of ZMs' probability\ndensity functions for different order numbers indicate the capability of ZMs in\ndescribing galaxy features. We classify the GZ2 samples, firstly into the\ngalaxies and non-galaxies and secondly, galaxies into spiral, elliptical, and\nodd objects (e.g., ring, lens, disturbed, irregular, merger, and dust lane).\nThe two models include the support vector machine (SVM) and one-dimensional\nconvolutional neural network (1D-CNN), which use ZMs, compared with the other\nthree classification models of 2D-CNN, ResNet50, and VGG16 that apply the\nfeatures from original images. We find the true skill statistic (TSS) greater\nthan 0.86 for the SVM and 1D-CNN with ZMs for the oversampled galaxy-non-galaxy\nclassifier. The SVM with ZMs model has a high-performance classification for\ngalaxy and non-galaxy datasets.

For FRBs, these distributions\nare primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM).\nCalibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of\naccurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the\nbaseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM\ndistribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described\nwell by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$.\nTesting two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of\nyoung and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$% of FRB sources may track\nstar formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of\n$1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is\nexcluded by only one model at $> 2\\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star\nformation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling\nresults from several JWST studies.

Aims. We aim at reproducing the $\\ell$=1 mode frequencies\nwithin the accuracy limits associated with the typical observational errors\n($\\sim$0.1 $\\mu$Hz) through interpolation on a grid of subgiant models.\nMethods. With that aim, we used variations of a two-step interpolation\nalgorithm, which considered linear and cubic splines interpolation methods and\ndifferent age proxies (physical age, scaled age, and central density). Results.\nThe best results were obtained using an algorithm that considers cubic splines\ninterpolation along tracks, linear interpolation across tracks, and central\ndensity $\\rho_\\text{c}$ as the age proxy. This combination yielded, on average,\nan absolute error of 0.14 $\\mu$Hz, but reached maximum absolute errors on the\ninterpolated frequencies of 1.2 $\\mu$Hz for some models, which is an order of\nmagnitude higher than the typical observational errors.

During this\nprocess, we discover six relevant design principles, which we consolidate\nthrough interviews with experienced rule designers at the SOC.We then validate\nour design principles by quantitatively assessing their effect on rule\nspecificity. We find that several of these design considerations significantly\nimpact unnecessary workload caused by rules. For instance, rules that leverage\nproxies for detection, and rules that do not employ alert throttling or do not\ndistinguish (un)successful malicious actions, cause significantly more workload\nfor SOC analysts. Moreover, rules that match a generalized characteristic to\ndetect malicious behavior, which is believed to increase coverage, also\nsignificantly increase workload, suggesting a tradeoff must be struck between\nrule specificity and coverage.

Brain networks are known to exhibit community structure at\nlocal, meso, and global scale. However, modularity is limited as a metric to a\nglobal scale describing the overall strength of community structure,\noverlooking important variations in community structure at node level. To\naddress this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel\nmeasure of nodal modularity (nQ) captures both mesoscale and local-scale\nchanges in modularity. We hypothesized that nQ would illuminate granular\nchanges in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which\nare known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored nQ in multiplex\nnetworks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the\nearly stages of AD. While limited by sample size, changes in nQ for individual\nregions of interest (ROIs) in our fMRI networks were predominantly observed in\nvisual, limbic, and paralimbic systems in the brain, aligning with known AD\ntrajectories and linked to amyloid-$\\beta$ and tau deposition. Furthermore,\nobserved changes in white-matter microstructure in our DTI networks in parietal\nand frontal regions may compliment studies of white-matter integrity in poor\nmemory binders. Additionally, nQ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters\nindicating that nQ may be sensitive to this key turning point of AD. Our\nfindings demonstrate the utility of nQ as a measure of localized group\nstructure, providing novel insights into task and disease-related variability\nat the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global\nmeasure, nQ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure\nof network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.",

We show that a\nsimilar dipole anisotropy exists in spectral-line intensity maps, represented\nas either galaxy number counts or the diffuse intensity maps. The amplitude of\nthese dipole anisotropies is determined by not only the solar velocity against\nthe large-scale structures but also the temporal evolution of the monopole\n(sky-average) component.

Our analysis relies on the\ndiagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier\ntransformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each\nmode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the\nproblem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with\nindependent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success\nprobability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series\nexpansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When\nthe latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is\ndescribed by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a\nuniversal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified\nin the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the\ncumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving\nrate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order.

Our modeling accounts for tidal effects on the sub-halo\npopulation, examining the conditions under which DM sub-halos can be detected\nand distinguished from conventional astrophysical sources. We find that regions\na few degrees above or below the Galactic plane offer the highest likelihood\nfor DM sub-halo detection.

To transcend this major conceptual\nbottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes\nnon-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to\naccurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new\nphenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows\ncertain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various\npoints in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an\nemergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and,\nmore impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes\nunique to GBZ bifurcation.The response from these novel spectral and GBZ\nsingularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such\nas photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can\nbe engineered in a versatile manner.Our framework directly generalizes to more\ncomplicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for\nexploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ\nfragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.",

The former is informed by observations of the quasar luminosity\nfunction (QLF) and the latter by the gravitational wave-background (GWB)\nrecently detected by PTAs, while estimates of the present-day black hole mass\nfunction provide a boundary condition. The GWB is dominated by the most massive\nblack holes ($\\gtrsim10^{9}M_{\\odot}$). We show that their evolution can be\nsimplified into a two-step process: mergers dominate at $z\\leq1$, while\naccretion peaks at $1.4\\leq z\\leq2$. The large amplitude of the observed GWB\nsuggests a significant number of mergers. We show that this generically implies\na higher average Eddington ratio for quasars relative to a scenario in which\nmergers are negligible. In the absence of mergers, matching local estimates of\nBH abundance to the QLF implies a radiative efficiency $\\epsilon_r=0.12$ and\nEddington ratio $\\lambda=0.2$. With mergers, a progenitor of mass $M_i$ is\nboosted to a final total mass $M_f$ and there is a direct relation between the\nmass gained in mergers and the average Eddington ratio of the quasar\npopulation, given by $M_f/M_i\\sim\\lambda/0.2$. There is thus a tension between\nthe observed GWB, quasar properties, and the BH mass function: estimates of the\nmass function consistent with Eddington ratios inferred in quasars and\n$\\epsilon_r\\sim0.1$ underpredict the GWB; multiple/equal mass mergers can boost\nthe GWB, but lead to a high Eddington ratio. If the local mass function is on\nthe high end of current estimates, the GWB is more readily explained, but\nrequires low efficiencies $\\epsilon_r\\sim10^{-2}$ not expected in standard\nluminous accretion models. The significant merger rate implied by the GWB also\nstrongly suggests that the most massive BHs in the local universe have\nsignificant spin due to the orbital angular momentum from mergers, perhaps\n$a\\sim0.5$.",

At the same\ntime, the ChPT Lagrangian is also reformulated using the single spurion and\nlepton fields, instead of external sources. The spurion matching can be\nperformed between LEFT and ChPT operators with the same flavor $SU(3)_V$ and\n$CP$ structures, and the same leptonic currents, using the naive dimensional\nanalysis at the quark and hadronic levels.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving demands safe motion planning, especially in critical\n\"long-tail\" scenarios. Recent end-to-end autonomous driving systems leverage\nlarge language models (LLMs) as planners to improve generalizability to rare\nevents. However, using LLMs at test time introduces high computational costs.\nTo address this, we propose DiMA, an end-to-end autonomous driving system that\nmaintains the efficiency of an LLM-free (or vision-based) planner while\nleveraging the world knowledge of an LLM. DiMA distills the information from a\nmulti-modal LLM to a vision-based end-to-end planner through a set of specially\ndesigned surrogate tasks. Under a joint training strategy, a scene encoder\ncommon to both networks produces structured representations that are\nsemantically grounded as well as aligned to the final planning objective.\nNotably, the LLM is optional at inference, enabling robust planning without\ncompromising on efficiency. Training with DiMA results in a 37% reduction in\nthe L2 trajectory error and an 80% reduction in the collision rate of the\nvision-based planner, as well as a 44% trajectory error reduction in longtail\nscenarios. DiMA also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes\nplanning benchmark.",

By interpreting these constraints\nthrough symbolic language representations and translating them into low-level\nactions, GeoManip bridges the gap between natural language and robotic\nexecution, enabling greater generalizability across diverse even unseen tasks,\nobjects, and scenarios. Unlike vision-language-action models that require\nextensive training, operates training-free by utilizing large foundational\nmodels: a constraint generation module that predicts stage-specific geometric\nconstraints and a geometry parser that identifies object parts involved in\nthese constraints. A solver then optimizes trajectories to satisfy inferred\nconstraints from task descriptions and the scene. Furthermore, GeoManip learns\nin-context and provides five appealing human-robot interaction features:\non-the-fly policy adaptation, learning from human demonstrations, learning from\nfailure cases, long-horizon action planning, and efficient data collection for\nimitation learning.

Despite encouraging progress,\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods focus on training innovative architectural\ndesigns on confined datasets. In this work, we investigate the impact of\nscaling up EHPS towards a family of generalist foundation models. 1) For data\nscaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 40 EHPS datasets,\nencompassing a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single\ndataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from\nthe extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select\ndatasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. Ultimately, we\nachieve diminishing returns at 10M training instances from diverse data\nsources. 2) For model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers (up to\nViT-Huge as the backbone) to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. To\nexclude the influence of algorithmic design, we base our experiments on two\nminimalist architectures: SMPLer-X, which consists of an intermediate step for\nhand and face localization, and SMPLest-X, an even simpler version that reduces\nthe network to its bare essentials and highlights significant advances in the\ncapture of articulated hands.

Although\nscaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the\ntokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how\nauto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and\ndownstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of\nscaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank. To facilitate this exploration,\nwe replace the typical convolutional backbone with an enhanced Vision\nTransformer architecture for Tokenization (ViTok). We train ViTok on\nlarge-scale image and video datasets far exceeding ImageNet-1K, removing data\nconstraints on tokenizer scaling. We first study how scaling the auto-encoder\nbottleneck affects both reconstruction and generation -- and find that while it\nis highly correlated with reconstruction, its relationship with generation is\nmore complex. We next explored the effect of separately scaling the\nauto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation\nperformance. Crucially, we find that scaling the encoder yields minimal gains\nfor either reconstruction or generation, while scaling the decoder boosts\nreconstruction but the benefits for generation are mixed. Building on our\nexploration, we design ViTok as a lightweight auto-encoder that achieves\ncompetitive performance with state-of-the-art auto-encoders on ImageNet-1K and\nCOCO reconstruction tasks (256p and 512p) while outperforming existing\nauto-encoders on 16-frame 128p video reconstruction for UCF-101, all with 2-5x\nfewer FLOPs. When integrated with Diffusion Transformers, ViTok demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and sets new\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks for class-conditional video generation on UCF-101.",

In turn, when understood as a resource for quantum\ncomputation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite\nits long recognised importance in quantum foundations and, more recently, in\nquantum computation, the mathematics of contextuality has remained somewhat\nelusive - different frameworks address different aspects of the phenomenon, yet\ntheir precise relationship often is unclear. In fact, there is a glaring\ndiscrepancy already between the original notion of contextuality introduced by\nKochen and Specker on the one side [J. Math. Mech., 17, 59, (1967)], and the\nmodern approach of studying contextual correlations on the other [Rev. Mod.\nPhys., 94, 045007 (2022)].\n  In a companion paper [arXiv:2408.16764], we introduce the conceptually new\ntool called ``context connections'', which allows to cast and analyse\nKochen-Specker (KS) contextuality in new form. Here, we generalise this notion,\nand based on it prove a complete characterisation of KS contextuality for\nfinite-dimensional systems. To this end, we develop the framework of\n``observable algebras\". We show in detail how this framework subsumes the\nmarginal and graph-theoretic approaches to contextuality, and thus that it\noffers a unified perspective on KS contextuality. In particular, we establish\nthe precise relationships between the various notions of ``contextuality\" used\nin the respective settings, and in doing so, generalise a number of results on\nthe characterisation of the respective notions in the literature.",

A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) simplifies\nthe generation of single-subplot figures, making PyPLUTO a powerful yet\nuser-friendly toolkit for astrophysical data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformer-based vision-language\naction (VLA) policies, can be tremendously effective for capturing complex and\ngeneralizable robotic behaviors. However, such models require us to choose a\ntokenization of our continuous action signals, which determines how the\ndiscrete symbols predicted by the model map to continuous robot actions. We\nfind that current approaches for robot action tokenization, based on simple\nper-dimension, per-timestep binning schemes, typically perform poorly when\nlearning dexterous skills from high-frequency robot data. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new compression-based tokenization scheme for robot\nactions, based on the discrete cosine transform. Our tokenization approach,\nFrequency-space Action Sequence Tokenization (FAST), enables us to train\nautoregressive VLAs for highly dexterous and high-frequency tasks where\nstandard discretization methods fail completely. Based on FAST, we release\nFAST+, a universal robot action tokenizer, trained on 1M real robot action\ntrajectories. It can be used as a black-box tokenizer for a wide range of robot\naction sequences, with diverse action spaces and control frequencies. Finally,\nwe show that, when combined with the pi0 VLA, our method can scale to training\non 10k hours of robot data and match the performance of diffusion VLAs, while\nreducing training time by up to 5x.",

    "abstract": "Sliding friction between two dry surfaces is reasonably described by the\nspeed-independent Amonton-Coulomb friction force law. However, there are many\nsituations where the frictional contact points between two surfaces are\n\"active\" and may not all be moving at the same relative speed. In this work we\nstudy the sliding friction properties of a system with multiple active contacts\neach with independent and controllable speed. We demonstrate that multiple\nactive contacts can produce controllable speed-dependent sliding friction\nforces, despite each individual contact exhibiting a speed-independent\nfriction. We study in experiment a rotating carousel with ten speed-controlled\nwheels in frictional contact with the ground. We first vary the contact speeds\nand demonstrate that the equilibrium system speed is the median of the active\ncontact speeds. Next we directly measure the ground reaction forces and observe\nhow the contact speeds can control the force-speed curve of the system. In the\nfinal experiments we demonstrate how control of the force-speed curve can\ncreate sliding friction with a controllable effective viscosity and\ncontrollable sliding friction coefficient. Surprisingly, we are able to\ndemonstrate that frictional contacts can create near frictionless sliding with\nappropriate force-speed control. By revealing how active contacts can shape the\nforce-speed behavior of dry sliding friction systems we can better understand\nanimal and robot locomotion, and furthermore open up opportunities for new\nengineered surfaces to control sliding friction.",

Successfully\nsynthesizing perovskite oxide samples usually requires a significant number of\ngrowth attempts and a detailed film characterization on each sample to find the\noptimal growth window of a material. The most common real-time \\textit{in situ}\ndiagnostic technique available during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) synthesis is\nreflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Conventional use of RHEED\nallows a highly experienced operator to determine growth rate by monitoring\nintensity osciallations and make some qualitative observations during growth,\nsuch as recognizing the sample has become amorphous or recognizing that large\nislands have formed on the surface. However, due to a lack of theoretical\nunderstanding of the diffraction patterns, finer, more precise levels of\nobservations are challenging. To address these limitations, we implement new\ndata analytics techniques in the growth of three LaFeO$_3$ samples on Nb-doped\nSrTiO$_3$ by MBE. These techniques improve our ability to perform unsupervised\nmachine learning using principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means\nclustering by using drift correction to overcome sample or stage motion during\ngrowth and intensity transformations that highlight more subtle features in the\nimages such as Kikuchi bands. With this approach, we enable the first\ndemonstration of PCA and k-means across multiple samples, allowing for\nquantitative comparison of RHEED videos for two LaFeO$_3$ film samples. These\ncapabilities set the stage for real-time processing of RHEED data during growth\nto enable machine learning-accelerated film synthesis.",

The pessimistic calibrated regret is the highest\ncalibrated regret of outcomes compatible with the observed data. This method\nrelaxes the previous requirement that a pricing algorithm must use\nfully-supported price distributions to be auditable. This method is at least as\npermissive as any auditing method that has a high probability of failing\nalgorithmic outcomes with non-vanishing calibrated regret. Additionally, we\nstrengthen the justification for using vanishing calibrated regret, versus\nvanishing best-in-hindsight regret, as the non-collusion definition, by showing\nthat even without any side information, the pricing algorithms that only\nsatisfy weaker vanishing best-in-hindsight regret allow an opponent to\nmanipulate them into posting supra-competitive prices.

We exploit\nthe full set of XMM-Newton observations, extending the previously studied\ndataset on variability by at least 12 years. Starting from the recent IXPE\nresult that places the so-called Bridge cloud 26 pc behind Sgr A*, we\nreconstruct the LOS position of the other clouds, assuming that they were\nilluminated by a single flare. Additionally, we derive the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the molecular density. We also study the 3D geometry of the\ncomplex in case two flares illuminate the clouds. As of spring 2024, the\nlightfront is still illuminating the Sgr A complex, with the Bridge currently\nbeing the brightest cloud. The other clouds in the complex have faded\nsignificantly. In the single flare scenario, the Sgr A complex is located\n$\\simeq$ 25 pc behind Sgr A*. In the past 25 years, the illuminated region\nspans 10-15 pc along the LOS. The derived PDF is roughly log-normal, consistent\nwith previous Chandra results, with a possible high-density excess. Both a\nsingle and a multiple flares scenario can explain the observed X-ray\nvariability. Previous concerns about the single flare scenario, raised by\nshorter monitoring, are now overcome in the 25 years of monitoring. If two\nflares illuminate the clouds, they must be separated by at least $\\sim$ 30\nyears. We speculate that these clouds are closer to Sgr A* than the nuclear\nmolecular ring at $\\simeq$ 100-200 pc and possibly drifting from the ring to\nthe inner region of the Galaxy.",

Although the\nproblem has been widely studied in simple graphs, few solutions have been\nproposed for multigraphs, in which two nodes can be connected by multiple\nedges, each denoting a possibly different type of relationship. In our new\nalgorithm MultiGraphMatch, nodes and edges can be associated with labels and\nmultiple properties. MultiGraphMatch introduces a novel data structure called\nbit matrix to efficiently index both the query and the target and filter the\nset of target edges that are matchable with each query edge. In addition, the\nalgorithm proposes a new technique for ordering the processing of query edges\nbased on the cardinalities of the sets of matchable edges. Using the CYPHER\nquery definition language, MultiGraphMatch can perform queries with logical\nconditions on node and edge labels. We compare MultiGraphMatch with SuMGra and\ngraph database systems Memgraph and Neo4J, showing comparable or better\nperformance in all queries on a wide variety of synthetic and real-world\ngraphs.",

Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling\nbehavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further\nimprove with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion\nmodels inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation\nvia the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically\nflatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling\nbehavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate\nhow the generation performance can further improve with increased computation.\nSpecifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises\nfor the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two\naxes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find\nbetter noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and\ntext-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that\nincreasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the\nquality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated\nnature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be\nspecifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.",

Building on the surrogate outcomes literature, we\ndevelop recalibrated prediction-powered inference, a more efficient approach to\nstatistical inference than existing PPI proposals. Our method departs from the\nexisting proposals by using flexible machine learning techniques to learn the\noptimal ``imputed loss'' through a step we call recalibration. Importantly, the\nmethod always improves upon the estimator that relies solely on the data with\navailable true outcomes, even when the optimal imputed loss is estimated\nimperfectly, and it achieves the smallest asymptotic variance among PPI\nestimators if the estimate is consistent. Computationally, our optimization\nobjective is convex whenever the loss function that defines the target\nparameter is convex. We further analyze the benefits of recalibration, both\ntheoretically and numerically, in several common scenarios where machine\nlearning predictions systematically deviate from the outcome of interest.

In-flight XMM-Newton's observations of soft protons represent a unique\nlaboratory to validate and improve our understanding of their interaction with\nthe mirror, optical filters, and X-ray instruments. At the same time, such\nmodels would link the observed background flares to the primary proton\npopulation encountered by the telescope, converting XMM-Newton into a monitor\nfor soft protons. We built a Geant4 simulation of XMM-Newton, including a\nverified mass model of the X-ray mirror, the focal plane assembly, and the EPIC\nMOS and pn-CCDs. We encoded the energy redistribution and proton transmission\nefficiency into a redistribution matrix file (RMF) and an auxiliary response\nfile (ARF). For the validation, three averaged soft proton spectra, one for\neach filter configuration, were extracted from a collection of 13 years of MOS\nobservations of the focused non X-ray background and analysed with Xspec. The\nbest-fit model is in agreement with the power-law distribution predicted from\nindependent measurements for the XMM-Newton orbit, spent mostly in the\nmagnetosheath and nearby regions.

    "abstract": "With the increased use of the internet and social networks for online\ndiscussions, the spread of toxic and inappropriate content on social networking\nsites has also increased. Several studies have been conducted in different\nlanguages. However, there is less work done for South Asian languages for\ninappropriate content identification using deep learning techniques. In Urdu\nlanguage, the spellings are not unique, and people write different common\nspellings for the same word, while mixing it other languages, like English in\nthe text makes it more challenging, and limited research work is available to\nprocess such language with the finest algorithms. The use of attention layer\nwith a deep learning model can help handling the long-term dependencies and\nincrease its efficiency . To explore the effects of the attention layer, this\nstudy proposes attention-based Bidirectional GRU hybrid model for identifying\ninappropriate content in Urdu Unicode text language. Four different baseline\ndeep learning models; LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, and TCN, are used to compare the\nperformance of the proposed model. The results of these models were compared\nbased on evaluation metrics, dataset size, and impact of the word embedding\nlayer. The pre-trained Urdu word2Vec embeddings were utilized for our case. Our\nproposed model BiGRU-A outperformed all other baseline models by yielding 84\\%\naccuracy without using pre-trained word2Vec layer. From our experiments, we\nhave established that the attention layer improves the model's efficiency, and\npre-trained word2Vec embedding does not work well with an inappropriate content\ndataset.",

This hybridization\ndrives an opening of a pseudogap below a characteristic temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{PG}}=6.8$ K. In the superconducting state, we observe an unusual\nupper critical field that increases linearly with decreasing temperatures from\n$0.4T_{c}$ to $0.01T_{c}$, suggestive of a possible exotic superconducting\nstate.

MLMs developed for remote sensing (RS) have demonstrated outstanding\nperformance in multiple tasks, such as visual question answering and visual\ngrounding. In addition to visual grounding that detects specific objects\ncorresponded to given instruction, aerial detection, which detects all objects\nof multiple categories, is also a valuable and challenging task for RS\nfoundation models. However, aerial detection has not been explored by existing\nRS MLMs because the autoregressive prediction mechanism of MLMs differs\nsignificantly from the detection outputs. In this paper, we present a simple\nbaseline for applying MLMs to aerial detection for the first time, named\nLMMRotate. Specifically, we first introduce a normalization method to transform\ndetection outputs into textual outputs to be compatible with the MLM framework.\nThen, we propose a evaluation method, which ensures a fair comparison between\nMLMs and conventional object detection models. We construct the baseline by\nfine-tuning open-source general-purpose MLMs and achieve impressive detection\nperformance comparable to conventional detector.

    "abstract": "This study conducts a systematic assessment of the capabilities of 12 machine\nlearning models and model variations in detecting economic ideology. As an\nevaluation benchmark, I use manifesto data spanning six elections in the United\nKingdom and pre-annotated by expert and crowd coders. The analysis assesses the\nperformance of several generative, fine-tuned, and zero-shot models at the\ngranular and aggregate levels. The results show that generative models such as\nGPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash consistently outperform other models against all\nbenchmarks. However, they pose issues of accessibility and resource\navailability. Fine-tuning yielded competitive performance and offers a reliable\nalternative through domain-specific optimization. But its dependency on\ntraining data severely limits scalability. Zero-shot models consistently face\ndifficulties with identifying signals of economic ideology, often resulting in\nnegative associations with human coding. Using general knowledge for the\ndomain-specific task of ideology scaling proved to be unreliable. Other key\nfindings include considerable within-party variation, fine-tuning benefiting\nfrom larger training data, and zero-shot's sensitivity to prompt content. The\nassessments include the strengths and limitations of each model and derive\nbest-practices for automated analyses of political content.",

In such networks, the limited coverage of\nWiFi and the high mobility of the nodes generate frequent topology changes and\nnetwork fragmentations. For these reasons, and taking into account that there\nis no central manager entity, routing packets through the network is a\nchallenging task. Therefore, offering an efficient routing strategy is crucial\nto the deployment of VANETs. This paper deals with the optimal parameter\nsetting of the optimized link state routing (OLSR), which is a well-known\nmobile ad hoc network routing protocol, by defining an optimization problem.\nThis way, a series of representative metaheuristic algorithms (particle swarm\noptimization, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, and simulated\nannealing) are studied in this paper to find automatically optimal\nconfigurations of this routing protocol. In addition, a set of realistic VANET\nscenarios (based in the city of M\\'alaga) have been defined to accurately\nevaluate the performance of the network under our automatic OLSR. In the\nexperiments, our tuned OLSR configurations result in better quality of service\n(QoS) than the standard request for comments (RFC 3626), as well as several\nhuman experts, making it amenable for utilization in VANET configurations.",

We acquired MUSE\ndata to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across\nthe shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and\nthe reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines\nare detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to\nBalmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state\nis zero if, and only if, the quantum state is a quantum Markov chain. Replacing\nthe Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional mutual\ninformation by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy, we obtain the\nBS-conditional mutual information, and we call the states with zero\nBS-conditional mutual information Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains. In\nthis article, we establish a correspondence which relates quantum Markov chains\nand BS-quantum Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery\nmap for the BS-entropy in the spirit of the Petz recovery map. Furthermore, we\nshow that, over the set of BS-quantum Markov chains, this correspondence\nconstitutes an entanglement-breaking map. Moreover, we prove a structural\ndecomposition of the Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains and also study\nstates for which the BS-conditional mutual information is only approximately\nzero. We subsequently extend the aforementioned correspondence, structural\ndecomposition and recovery map to arbitrary pairs of states and conditional\nexpectations. As an application of the correspondence, we find the first family\nof states with non-vanishing conditional mutual information for which it decays\nsuperexponentially fast with the size of the middle system.",

    "abstract": "For privacy and security concerns, the need to erase unwanted information\nfrom pre-trained vision models is becoming evident nowadays. In real-world\nscenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model\nowners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a\nsetting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a\npre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as\ncontinual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted\nknowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining\nknowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal.\n(iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially\nmissing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose\nGroup Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce LoRA\nmodules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting\ntask independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is\nadopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out\nthe others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we\nincorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a\nmore practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the\nlogits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the\nlogits closer to their respective prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments\non face recognition, object detection and image classification and demonstrate\nthat our method manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other\nclasses.

It has\nlong been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most\nwidely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase\nestimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high\ncircuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent\nalternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and\nearly-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum\ndiagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a\nclassical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed\nwith quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial\ntime under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and\nsparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of\nlattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing\nKrylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our\napproach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the\nlargest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model\non a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \\cdot 10^3$\ntwo-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with\ndensity matrix renormalization group calculations.",

Intriguingly, the substitution\nof S for O in PbTiO3 further increases the tetragonality of PbTiO3.\nConsequently, an unusually enhanced NTE with an average volumetric coefficient\nof thermal expansion $\\bar{\\alpha}_V$ = -2.50 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K was achieved\nover a wide temperature range (300 -- 790 K), which is contrasted to that of\npristine PbTiO3 ($\\bar{\\alpha}_V$ = -1.99 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K RT -- 763 K).\nThe intensified NTE is attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pb/Ti\nand O/S atoms by the substitution of S, as evidenced by our theoretical\ninvestigations.

A recent reanalysis within the dispersive\napproach has found that after resolving the issue of kinematic singularities in\nprevious approaches, a larger result is obtained, a few $10^{-11}$, and with\nopposite sign as in previous results, when a simple quark model for the\ntransition form factors is employed. In this paper, we present the first\ncomplete evaluation of tensor meson contributions within a hard-wall model in\nholographic QCD, which reproduces surprisingly well mass, two-photon width, and\nthe observed singly virtual transition form factors of the dominant\n$f_2(1270)$. Due to a second structure function that is absent in the quark\nmodel and in lowest-order resonance chiral theory, the result for $a_\\mu$ turns\nout to be positive instead of negative, and also with a magnitude of a few\n$10^{-11}$. We find that the infinite tower of tensor mesons permits to fill\nthe gap in the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint on the HLbL\namplitude left by the contribution of axial vector mesons. Matching the\ncorresponding leading-order OPE result leads to two-photon couplings consistent\nwith the observed combined effects of the ground-state $f_2,a_2,f_2'$ multiplet\nand a total $a_\\mu^\\mathrm{Tensor}$ contribution of $+12.4\\times 10^{-11}$;\nwith an $F_\\rho$ fit this is reduced slightly to $+11.1\\times 10^{-11}$.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

    "abstract": "Debugging software, i.e., the localization of faults and their repair, is a\nkey activity in software engineering. Therefore, effective and efficient\ndebugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However,\nthe teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in\nindirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer\nScience (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way.\nIn this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging\nthat interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance\naims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper\nlearning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be\nintegrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We\ndeveloped a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization\ntechniques and large language models. Students can use features like the\nautomated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and\nexecuted a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS\nstudents. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the\nsystematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most\neffective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the\nbreakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and\nimplementation, and perform more intensive user studies.",

    "abstract": "We study the heat content on quantum graphs and investigate whether an\nanalogon of the Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality holds.

We prove that this holds at extremal times, that is at small and\nat large times. For this, we employ two complementary approaches: In the large\ntime regime, we rely on a spectral-theoretic approach, using Mercer's theorem\nwhereas the small-time regime is dealt with by a random walk approach using the\nFeynman-Kac formula and Brownian motions on metric graphs. In particular, in\nproving the latter, we develop a new expression for the heat content as a\npositive linear combination of expected return times of (discrete) random walks\n- a formulation which seems to yield additional insights compared to previously\navailable methods such as the celebrated Roth formula and which is crucial for\nour proof.

    "abstract": "It was shown recently by Ars\\'enio and the author that the two-dimensional\nincompressible Euler--Maxwell system is globally well-posed in the Yudovich\nclass, provided that the electromagnetic field enjoys appropriate conditions,\nincluding the Normal Structure. In this paper, we prove that this assumption is\nsharp, in the sense that the Euler--Maxwell system becomes ill-posed in the\nYudovich class for initial data that do not obey the Normal Structure\ncondition. The proof applies to both the whole plane and the two-dimensional\ntorus, and holds for any value of the speed of light $c\\in (0,\\infty)$. This is\nachieved by expanding the magnetic field around a horizontal background and\nshowing that the Lorentz force can be decomposed into two parts: the first is\nin the form of a singular operator acting on the vorticity, and the second, a\n\"remainder\", is of lower order when analyzed in a specific time regime.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the transition probability rate of a Unruh-DeWitt (UD)\ndetector interacting with massless scalar field for a finite duration of proper\ntime, $T$, of the detector. For a UD detector moving at a uniform acceleration,\n$a$, we explicitly show that the finite-time transition probability rate can be\nwritten as a sum of purely thermal terms, and non-thermal transient terms.\nWhile the thermal terms are independent of time, $T$, the non-thermal transient\nterms depend on $(\\Delta ET)$, $(aT)$, and $(\\Delta E/a)$, where $\\Delta E$ is\nthe energy gap of the detector. Particularly, the non-thermal terms are\noscillatory with respect to the variable $(\\Delta ET)$, so that they may be\naveraged out to be insignificant in the limit $\\Delta ET \\gg 1$, irrespective\nof the values of $(aT)$ and $(\\Delta E/a)$. To quantify the contribution of\nnon-thermal transient terms to the transition probability rate of a uniformly\naccelerating detector, we introduce a parameter, $\\varepsilon_{\\rm nt}$, called\nnon-thermal parameter. Demanding the contribution of non-thermal terms in the\nfinite-time transition probability rate to be negligibly small, \\ie,\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm nt}=\\delta\\ll1$, we calculate the thermalization time -- the\ntime required for the detector to interact with the field to arrive at the\nrequired non-thermality, $\\varepsilon_{\\rm nt}=\\delta$, and the detector to be\n(almost) thermalized with the Unruh bath in its comoving frame. Specifically,\nfor small accelerations, $a\\ll\\Delta E$, we find the thermalization time,\n$\\tau_{\\rm th}$, to be $\\tau_{\\rm th} \\sim (\\Delta E)^{-1} \\times {\\rm\ne}^{2\\pi|\\Delta E|/a}/\\delta$; and for large accelerations, $a\\gg \\Delta E$, we\nfind the thermalization time to be $\\tau_{\\rm th} \\sim (\\Delta E)^{-1}/\\delta$.\nWe comment on the possibilities of bringing down the exponentially large\nthermalization time at small accelerations, $a\\ll\\Delta E$.",

    "abstract": "Humans learn about the world, and how to act in the world, in many ways: from\nindividually conducting experiments to observing and reproducing others'\nbehavior. Different learning strategies come with different costs and\nlikelihoods of successfully learning more about the world. The choice that any\none individual makes of how to learn can have an impact on the collective\nunderstanding of a whole population if people learn from each other. Alan\nRogers developed simulations of a population of agents to study these network\nphenomena where agents could individually or socially learn amidst a dynamic,\nuncertain world and uncovered a confusing result: the availability of cheap\nsocial learning yielded no benefit to population fitness over individual\nlearning. This paradox spawned decades of work trying to understand and uncover\nfactors that foster the relative benefit of social learning that centuries of\nhuman behavior suggest exists. What happens in such network models now that\nhumans can socially learn from AI systems that are themselves socially learning\nfrom us? We revisit Rogers' Paradox in the context of human-AI interaction to\nprobe a simplified network of humans and AI systems learning together about an\nuncertain world. We propose and examine the impact of several learning\nstrategies on the quality of the equilibrium of a society's 'collective world\nmodel'. We consider strategies that can be undertaken by various stakeholders\ninvolved in a single human-AI interaction: human, AI model builder, and society\nor regulators around the interaction. We then consider possible negative\nfeedback loops that may arise from humans learning socially from AI: that\nlearning from the AI may impact our own ability to learn about the world. We\nclose with open directions into studying networks of human and AI systems that\ncan be explored in enriched versions of our simulation framework.",

    "abstract": "Flapping-based propulsive systems rely on fluid-structure interactions to\nproduce thrust. At intermediate and high Reynolds numbers, vortex formation and\norganization in the wake of such systems are crucial for the generation of a\npropulsive force. In this work, we experimentally investigate the wake produced\nby a tethered robotic fish immersed in a water tunnel. By systematically\nvarying the amplitude and frequency of the fish tail as well as the free-stream\nspeed, we are able to observe and characterize different vortex streets as a\nfunction of the Strouhal number. The produced wakes are three-dimensional and\nexhibit a classical V-shape, mainly with two oblique trains of vortex rings\nconvecting outward. Using two-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in\nthe mid-span plane behind the fish and through extensive data processing of the\nvelocity and vorticity fields, we demonstrate the strong couplings at place\nbetween vortex dynamics, thrust production and wake structure. We first measure\nthe evolution of the vortex velocity with the Strouhal number, and model it\nusing a momentum balance equation directly related to thrust production. We\nthen focus on the wake structure, such as wake angle as well as vortex ring\norientation, diameter and vorticity. The wake structure is modelled in a simple\ngeometrical framework where the vortex ring velocity is composed of the\nfree-stream speed and the ring self-advecting speed. This framework is tested\nand validated by our experimental measurements as well as literature data\ncollapsing on master curves, highlighting a universal behavior dominated by the\nStrouhal number. This allows us to establish a comprehensive understanding of\nhow the wake structure varies with this number and, thus, thrust production.",

It has been demonstrated\nthat FIAs can bypass system security mechanisms, cause faulty outputs, and gain\naccess to secret information. Certain types of FIAs can be mounted with little\neffort by tampering with clock signals and or the chip operating conditions. To\nmitigate such low cost, yet powerful attacks, we propose a fully synthesizable\nand distributable in situ fault injection monitor that employs a delay locked\nloop to track the pulsewidth of the clock. We further develop a fully automated\ndesign framework to optimize and implement the FIA monitors at any process\nnode. Our design is fabricated and verified in 65 nm CMOS technology with a\nsmall footprint of 1500 um2. It can lock to clock frequencies from 2 MHz to\n1.26 GHz while detecting all 12 types of possible clock glitches, as well as\ntiming FIA injections via the supply voltage, electromagnetic signals, and chip\ntemperature.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can implement arbitrary\noperations and signal processing functionalities directly in the optical\ndomain. Run-time configuration of these circuits requires an electronic control\nlayer to adjust the working point of their building elements and make them\ncompensate for thermal drifts or degradations of the input signal. As the\nadvancement of photonic foundries enables the fabrication of chips of\nincreasing complexity, developing scalable electronic controllers becomes\ncrucial for the operation of complex PICs. In this paper, we present an\nelectronic application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for\nreconfiguration of PICs featuring numerous tuneable elements. Each channel of\nthe ASIC controller independently addresses one optical component of the PIC,\nas multiple parallel local feedback loops are operated to achieve full control.\nThe proposed design is validated through real-time reconfiguration of a\n16-channel silicon photonics adaptive beam coupler. Results demonstrate\nautomatic coupling of an arbitrary input beam to a single-mode waveguide,\ndynamic compensation of beam wavefront distortions and successful transmission\nof a 50 Gbit/s signal through an optical free-space link. The low power\nconsumption and compactness of the electronic chip provide a scalable paradigm\nthat can be seamlessly extended to larger photonic architectures.",

Adding\nenvelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and\ncontract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after\ntwo oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model.\nIn addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the\nnon-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we\nstrengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar\nmodels of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding\njets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that\nenvelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than\nin the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor\nunstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with\nand without envelope rotation.

While there are a\nnumber of empirical studies that report results on the effectiveness, in terms\nof code coverage and other related metrics, of the various test generation\nstrategies and algorithms implemented in EvoSuite, there are no studies, to the\nbest of our knowledge, on the energy consumption associated to the automated\ntest generation.

The results show that\nthe different test generation algorithms consumed different amounts of energy,\nin particular on classes with high cyclomatic complexity. Furthermore, we also\nobserve that manual tests tend to consume more energy as compared to\nautomatically generated tests, without necessarily achieving higher code\ncoverage.

Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)\nobservations have revealed electron scale MHs to be ubiquitous in the turbulent\nEarth's magnetosheath, potentially playing an important role in the energy\ncascade and dissipation. Despite abundant observations, the origin of electron\nscale MHs is still unclear and debated. In this work, we use fully kinetic\nsimulations to investigate the role of plasma turbulence in generating electron\nscale MHs. We perform a fully kinetic simulation of freely decaying plasma\nturbulence, initialized with typical Earth's magnetosheath parameters. We find\nthat electron scale MHs can be generated by turbulence via the following\nmechanism: first, large-scale turbulent velocity shears produce regions with\nhigh electron temperature anisotropy; these localized regions become unstable,\ngenerating oblique electron scale whistler waves; as they propagate over the\ninhomogeneous turbulent background, whistler fluctuations develop an\nelectrostatic component, turning into Bernstein-like modes; the strong\nelectrostatic fluctuations produce current filaments that merge into an\nelectron scale current vortex; the resulting electron vortex locally reduces\nthe magnetic field amplitude, finally evolving into an electron scale MH. We\nshow that MHs generated by this mechanism have properties consistent with MMS\nobservations and nontrivial kinetic features. We provide numerical evidence of\na new electron scale MH generation mechanism, driven by turbulence.

While microgravity gel data are limited to 2D projections, ground-based\ndata establish a correspondence between the 2D and 3D $g(r)$ peak heights. Our\nresults provide new insights into how colloidal gels age in the absence of\ngravitational collapse.",

We find that both the secluded and catalyzed annihilation\nscenarios can be realized in this model. The phenomenology of DM, including\nrelic density, indirect detection (Fermi-LAT), and CMB (Planck) constraints, is\ndiscussed.

The\nfirm, rather than laying off idle workers, is assumed to exploit this potential\nby involving them in the innovation process. Results show that a firm's\norganizational and managerial decisions, the temporal structure of the\nproduction system, the speed at which workers learn and forget, and the pace of\ninnovation are critical factors influencing production efficiency in both the\nshort and long run. The co-evolution of production and innovation processes\nemerges in our model through the two-sided effects of idleness: whereas it\ndrives skill decay it is also a condition for creative thinking that can be\nleveraged for innovation.

On\nthe other hand, asynchronously rotating planets feature moving hotspots either\nlagging or leading the corresponding substellar point as it translates along\nthe surface. We show that a planet falling in the latter category could mimic\nthe circulation of tidally synchronous planets under the influence of\ntime-varying instellation, possibly provided by pulsating or multiple star\nsystems. This happens when the planets diurnal period is in resonance with the\nperiod of instellation variation, leading to a planet-frame-fixed hotspot.\nSlight differences in the above periods lead to East-West or West-East creeping\nhotspots with a period significantly longer than both. The rate of hotspot\nmotion is given by the difference between the diurnal and instellation\nvariation rates, similar to the lower envelope frequency of beat patterns\nformed by two superposed waves in linear wave theory. We call this phenomenon\nbeating. A combination of the radiative, rotational, wave propagation, and drag\ntimescales establishes dynamical constraints on beating. Based on this we\nclassify a set of Kepler and TESS circumbinary planets with two candidates\nexhibiting climatic departures from the no-variation scenario. In general,\nhotter and faster-spinning planets are more susceptible to climatic departures.\nBeating, if it occurs, may additionally create optimistic extensions of\nhabitable zones for corresponding systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have\nfacilitated the deployment of the mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism in the\nstock investment domain. While these models have demonstrated promising trading\nperformance, they are often unimodal, neglecting the wealth of information\navailable in other modalities, such as textual data. Moreover, the traditional\nneural network-based router selection mechanism fails to consider contextual\nand real-world nuances, resulting in suboptimal expert selection. To address\nthese limitations, we propose LLMoE, a novel framework that employs LLMs as the\nrouter within the MoE architecture. Specifically, we replace the conventional\nneural network-based router with LLMs, leveraging their extensive world\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities to select experts based on historical\nprice data and stock news. This approach provides a more effective and\ninterpretable selection mechanism. Our experiments on multimodal real-world\nstock datasets demonstrate that LLMoE outperforms state-of-the-art MoE models\nand other deep neural network approaches. Additionally, the flexible\narchitecture of LLMoE allows for easy adaptation to various downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition technology has dramatically transformed the landscape of\nsecurity, surveillance, and authentication systems, offering a user-friendly\nand non-invasive biometric solution. However, despite its significant\nadvantages, face recognition systems face increasing threats from physical and\ndigital spoofing attacks. Current research typically treats face recognition\nand attack detection as distinct classification challenges. This approach\nnecessitates the implementation of separate models for each task, leading to\nconsiderable computational complexity, particularly on devices with limited\nresources. Such inefficiencies can stifle scalability and hinder performance.\nIn response to these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative unified\nmodel designed for face recognition and detection of physical and digital\nattacks. By leveraging the advanced Swin Transformer backbone and incorporating\nHiLo attention in a convolutional neural network framework, we address unified\nface recognition and spoof attack detection more effectively. Moreover, we\nintroduce augmentation techniques that replicate the traits of physical and\ndigital spoofing cues, significantly enhancing our model robustness. Through\ncomprehensive experimental evaluation across various datasets, we showcase the\neffectiveness of our model in unified face recognition and spoof detection.\nAdditionally, we confirm its resilience against unseen physical and digital\nspoofing attacks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.",

The\ncomplicated interplay between these two models makes it very hard to reason on\nthe system as a whole, especially when the objective is to find plans with\nrobustness guarantees, considering the non-deterministic behavior of the lower\nlayers of the system.\n  In this paper, we introduce the problem of Platform-Aware Mission Planning\n(PAMP), addressing it in the setting of temporal durative actions. The PAMP\nproblem differs from standard temporal planning for its exists-forall nature:\nthe high-level plan dealing with mission goals is required to satisfy safety\nand executability constraints, for all the possible non-deterministic\nexecutions of the low-level model of the platform and the environment. We\npropose two approaches for solving PAMP. The first baseline approach\namalgamates the mission and platform levels, while the second is based on an\nabstraction-refinement loop that leverages the combination of a planner and a\nverification engine.

    "abstract": "Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic\nfluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in\nterms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large\ndeviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium,\nusing mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral\nmethods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a\nrare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena\nthat appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory\nstatistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the\nadditivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current\ndistribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to\nhigher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector\nfield becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in\ncurrent fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory\nstatistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open\nchannels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint\nstatistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation\nsymmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent\ntraveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss\nthe microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an\nemerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective,\nwe find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter\nin traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field\nmechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems.

We show that the laser acts as an autonomous work source and that, in\nthe macroscopic limit, the work produced is independent of the phase of the\nlaser. Using the dressed qubit approach, we show that the variation of energy\nin the laser is not the work transferred to the dressed qubit, which is instead\nobtained from the ''dressed laser'' -- a coherent superposition of the laser\nand the qubit. Using a two-point measurement technique with counting fields, we\nobtain the full counting statistics for the work of the laser and dressed\nlaser, and show that they satisfy Crooks fluctuation theorems. We then use\nthese theorems as criteria to investigate the thermodynamic consistency of\nquantum master equations, first in the autonomous setup for the combined\nsystem, then in the non-autonomous setup where the coherent field is eliminated\nand effectively described by a time dependent external field. Treating the\nlaser as an external field in known to yield expressions for the work which are\nin contradiction with quantum thermodynamics predictions in the strong drive\nregime.

We formalize this by studying general dynamic random\ngraphs that converge dynamically locally in probability and demonstrate that\nthe epidemic on these graphs converges to the epidemic on their dynamic local\nlimit graphs. We provide a detailed treatment of the theory of dynamic local\nconvergence, which remains a relatively new topic in the study of random\ngraphs. One main conclusion of our paper is that a specific form of dynamic\nlocal convergence is required for our results to hold.",

The inherent delays in\nsuch settings not only introduce additional bias to the system but also obscure\nthe disruptions caused by Byzantine faults. To tackle these issues, we adapt\nthe Byzantine framework to asynchronous dynamics by introducing a novel\nweighted robust aggregation framework.

By further incorporating a recent\nvariance-reduction technique, we achieve an optimal convergence rate for the\nfirst time in an asynchronous Byzantine environment.

Recent studies have demonstrated that wavelet analysis\ncan uncover subtle forgery artifacts that remain imperceptible in the spatial\ndomain. Wavelets effectively capture important facial contours, which are often\nslender, fine-grained, and global in nature. However, existing wavelet-based\napproaches fail to fully leverage these unique characteristics, resulting in\nsub-optimal feature extraction and limited generalizability. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce WMamba, a novel wavelet-based feature extractor built\nupon the Mamba architecture.

First, we propose Dynamic Contour\nConvolution (DCConv), which employs specially crafted deformable kernels to\nadaptively model slender facial contours. Second, by leveraging the Mamba\narchitecture, our method captures long-range spatial relationships with linear\ncomputational complexity. This efficiency allows for the extraction of\nfine-grained, global forgery artifacts from small image patches.

When identifying a predictive model of low rank processes from\nsampling data, the rank-deficient property of spectral densities is often\nobscured by the inevitable measurement noise in practice. However, existing low\nrank identification approaches often did not take noise into explicit\nconsideration, leading to non-negligible inaccuracies even under weak noise. In\nthis paper, we address the identification issue of low rank processes under\nmeasurement noise. We find that the noisy measurement model admits a sparse\nplus low rank structure in latent-variable graphical models. Specifically, we\nfirst decompose the problem into a maximum entropy covariance extension\nproblem, and a low rank graphical estimation problem based on an autoregressive\nmoving-average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model. To identify the ARMAX low\nrank graphical models, we propose an estimation approach based on maximum\nlikelihood.

    "abstract": "We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the\nLindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate\nthe solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential\napproximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential\nequation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to\nobtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.\n  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be\nexplicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results.\nThrough numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method,\nempirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive\ntime-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the\nLindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust\nthe truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of\nthe density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly\nreduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an\nappropriate truncation.",

Our survey provides insight into US policymakers'\nexpectations regarding the effects of AI on local communities and the nation,\nas well as their attitudes towards specific regulatory policies. Conducted in\ntwo waves (2022 and 2023), the survey captures changes in attitudes following\nthe release of ChatGPT and the subsequent surge in public awareness of AI.\nLocal policymakers express a mix of concern, optimism, and uncertainty about\nAI's impacts, anticipating significant societal risks such as increased\nsurveillance, misinformation, and political polarization, alongside potential\nbenefits in innovation and infrastructure. Many also report feeling\nunderprepared and inadequately informed to make AI-related decisions. On\nregulation, a majority of policymakers support government oversight and favor\nspecific policies addressing issues such as data privacy, AI-related\nunemployment, and AI safety and fairness. Democrats show stronger and more\nconsistent support for regulation than Republicans, but the latter experienced\na notable shift towards majority support between 2022 and 2023. Our study\ncontributes to understanding the perspectives of local policymakers-key players\nin shaping state and federal AI legislation-by capturing evolving attitudes,\npartisan dynamics, and their implications for policy formation.

The physical mechanism and possible connection between the two\ntypes of CLAGNs are still unclear. We explore the evolution of the broadband\nX-ray spectra from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (\\nustar\\,) and column\ndensity in five CLAGNs with moderate inclination viewing angles, which have\nshown significant variations of both optical types and X-ray absorption. Based\non a phenomenological and two clumpy torus models, we find that the X-ray\nphoton index ($\\Gamma$) and the Eddington-scaled X-ray $2-10$ keV luminosity\n($L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd}$) are positively correlated for the five sources, which\nare similar to other bright AGNs and optical CLAGNs at type 1 phase.

Similar to changing-state AGNs,\nchanging-obscuration AGNs may be also triggered by the evolution of the\naccretion disc.

    "abstract": "In the past few years, \"metaverse\" and \"non-fungible tokens (NFT)\" have\nbecome buzzwords, and the prices of related assets have exhibited large\nfluctuations. Are those characteristic of a speculative bubble? In this paper,\nwe attempt to answer this question, and better understand the underlying\neconomic dynamics. We look at Decentraland, a virtual world platform where land\nparcels are sold as NFT collections. We find that initially, land prices\nfollowed traditional real estate pricing models - in particular, value\ndecreased with distance from the most desirable areas - suggesting Decentraland\nbehaved much like a virtual city. However, these real estate pricing models\nstopped applying when both the metaverse and NFTs gained increased popular\nattention and enthusiasm in 2021, suggesting a new driving force for the\nunderlying asset prices. At that time, following a substantial rise in NFT\nmarket values, short-term holders of multiple parcels began to take major\nselling positions in the Decentraland market, which hints that, rather than\nbuilding a metaverse community, early Decentraland investors preferred to cash\nout when land valuations became inflated. Our analysis also shows that while\nthe majority of buyers are new entrants to the market (many of whom joined\nduring the bubble), liquidity (i.e., parcels) was mostly provided by early\nadopters selling, which caused stark differences in monetary gains. Early\nadopters made money - more than 10,000 USD on average per parcel sold - but\nusers who joined later typically made no profit or even incurred losses in the\norder of 1,000 USD per parcel. Unlike established markets such as financial and\nreal estate markets, newly emergent digital marketplaces are mostly\nself-regulated. As a result, the significant financial risks we identify\nindicate a strong need for establishing appropriate standards of business\nconduct and improving user awareness.",

IFRA, which stands\nfor Instrumented Fall Risk Assessment, has been developed using a two-step\nprocess: first, features with the highest predictive power among those\ncollected in a ITUG test have been identified using machine learning\ntechniques; then, a strategy is proposed to stratify patients into low, medium,\nor high-risk strata.

The kinetic energy of the jets\ndissipates, leading to the production of an enormous amount of $\\gamma$-ray\nphotons and possibly also the acceleration of protons. The accelerated protons\nwill interact with the radiation of the GRB via the photomeson and\nBethe-Heitler processes, which can initiate electromagnetic cascades. This\nprocess can give rise to broadband radiation up to the GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-ray\nregime. The expected $\\gamma$-ray flux from cascades depends on properties of\nthe GRB jet, such as the dissipation radius $R_{\\rm diss}$, the bulk Lorentz\nfactor $\\Gamma$, and the baryon loading factor $\\eta_p$. Therefore,\nobservations of Fermi-LAT can impose constraints on these important parameters.\nIn this study, we select 12 GRBs of high keV-MeV fluence and constrain the\nbaryon loading factor, under different combinations of the bulk Lorentz factor\nand the dissipation radius based on Fermi-LAT's measurements. Our findings\nindicate a strong constraint of $\\eta_p<10$ for most selected GRBs over a large\nparameter space except for large dissipation radii ($\\gtrsim 10^{15}\\rm cm$)\nand high bulk Lorentz factors ($\\gtrsim 600$). The constraint is comparable to,\nand in some GRBs even stronger than, that from high-energy neutrinos for\nstacked GRBs. Our results suggest that for typical bulk Lorentz factor of\nseveral hundreds, the dissipation radii of GRBs need be large to avoid\novershooting the GeV gamma-ray flux during the prompt emission phase of GRBs,\nwhich can be used to constrain GRBs.",

Following a small software development team at a Norwegian\nhospital, we observe their process of simultaneously developing the AI\napplication and discovering what explanations clinicians require from the AI\npredictions. Since clinicians struggled to articulate their explainability\nneeds before interacting with the system, an iterative approach proved\neffective: the team started with minimal explanations and refined these based\non clinicians' responses during real patient examinations. Our preliminary\nfindings from the first two iterations show that clinicians valued\n\"interrogative explanations\" - i.e., tools that let them explore and compare\nthe AI predictions with their own assessments - over detailed technical\nexplanations of the AI model's inner workings. Based on our analysis, we\nsuggest that successful explainability requirements emerge through iterative\ncollaboration between developers and users rather than being fully specified\nupfront. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical case study\non eliciting explainability requirements in software engineering.",

However, the compute and memory requirements introduced by\ntransformer models make them challenging to adopt for edge applications.\nFurthermore, fine-tuning pre-trained transformers (e.g., foundation models) is\na common task to enhance the model's predictive performance on specific\ntasks/applications. Existing transformer accelerators are oblivious to\ncomplexities introduced by fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the design of\na three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous architecture referred to as Atleus that\nincorporates heterogeneous computing resources specifically optimized to\naccelerate transformer models for the dual purposes of fine-tuning and\ninference. Specifically, Atleus utilizes non-volatile memory and systolic array\nfor accelerating transformer computational kernels using an integrated 3D\nplatform. Moreover, we design a suitable NoC to achieve high performance and\nenergy efficiency. Finally, Atleus adopts an effective quantization scheme to\nsupport model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Atleus\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art by up to 56x and 64.5x in terms of\nperformance and energy efficiency respectively",

The\nmost attractive feature of this detector is its ultra-low material budget,\nwhich is 0.28\\% X/X$_0$ and can be further reduced by decreasing the thickness\nof the gas traversed by the incident particles. Thus, it provides excellent\nposition reconstruction and reduced multi-scattering. This detector consists of\ntwo GEM-TPCs with drift fields in opposite directions, achieved by rotating one\n180 degrees in the middle plane with respect to the other. These two GEM-TPCs\nshare the same gas volume, i.e., inside a single vessel. This configuration is\ncalled a TWIN configuration. The results presented in this work were measured\nusing the newly integrated VMM3a/SRS readout electronics, an important\nmilestone in improving overall performance and capabilities. In 2024, this\ndetector was tested at the H4 beamline of the SPS at CERN, using muons and\npions and with different gas mixtures like, for instance: Ar/CO$_2$ (70/30 \\%),\nHe/CO$_2$ (70/30 \\%) and He/CO$_2$ (90/10 \\%). The helium-based mixtures were\nused to commission the detector to track low momenta muons required in the PSI\nmuon-induced X-ray emission (MIXE) experiment.

    "abstract": "The white dwarf mass distribution has been studied primarily at two extremes:\nobjects that presumably evolved as single stars and members of close binaries\nthat likely underwent substantial interaction. This work considers the\nintermediate separation regime of ~1 au and demonstrates how binary interaction\naffects white dwarf masses. The binary mass ratio distribution is utilized for\nthis purpose. Modeled as a truncated Pareto profile, this distribution provides\ninsights into the populations' properties and evolutionary history. When\napplied to homogeneous samples of binaries with giant primaries of similar age,\nthe distribution's shape constrains the fraction of white dwarf companions, the\nwhite dwarf mass distribution, and the properties of their progenitors. As a\ntest case, this method is applied to a small spectroscopic sample of binaries\nin open clusters with red giant primaries and orbital periods between 0.5 and\n20 years. The analysis reveals that white dwarfs in these systems are ~20% less\nmassive than their isolated counterparts, with a typical mass of ~0.55 Msun.\nTheir progenitors likely lost 80-85% of their mass, with binary interactions\nenhancing mass loss by an additional ~0.2 Msun. These findings highlight the\nutility of this approach for studying binary evolution and improving population\nmodels, particularly with future datasets from Gaia and other large-scale\nsurveys.",

After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods,\nwhich appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early\nuniverse, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST\nobservational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent\nwidths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII $\\lambda$1640, OIII]\n$\\lambda$1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII $\\lambda$4686. We\nfind that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line\nratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII $\\lambda$1640 and CIII] / HeII $\\lambda$1640, as\nwell as the EW of HeII $\\lambda$1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the\nHeII $\\lambda$1640 and OIII] $\\lambda$1665 lines would need to be detected\nseparately. We show that the HeII $\\lambda$1640/H$\\beta$ ratio effectively\nseparates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust\ncontent. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics,\nfuture observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at\n$z > 6$. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these\ndiagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify\nthem as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of\nHeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection\nprocess using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify\nstrong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample\nemerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and\nstrong UV emission.

The\nchain contains a single distortion - a hernia - which brings the two letters at\nits bottom together such that they interact. Due to interactions with the\nsolvent, the hernia performs a random hopping motion along the chain with the\ntransition rates dependent on its actual position. Our two focal questions are\na) the dependence of various transport properties on the letters' interaction\nenergy and b) whether these properties are self-averaging with respect to\ndifferent realizations of sequences. We show that the current through a finite\ninterval, the resistance of this interval and the splitting probabilities on\nthis interval lack self-averaging. On the contrary, the mean first-passage time\nthrough a finite interval with $N$ sites and the diffusion coefficient in a\nperiodic chain are self-averaging in the limit $N \\to \\infty$.

    "abstract": "The appearance of surface impurities (e.g., water stains, fingerprints,\nstickers) is an often-mentioned issue that causes degradation of automated\nvisual inspection systems. At the same time, synthetic data generation\ntechniques for visual surface inspection have focused primarily on generating\nperfect examples and defects, disregarding impurities. This study highlights\nthe importance of considering impurities when generating synthetic data. We\nintroduce a procedural method to include photorealistic water stains in\nsynthetic data. The synthetic datasets are generated to correspond to real\ndatasets and are further used to train an anomaly detection model and\ninvestigate the influence of water stains. The high-resolution images used for\nsurface inspection lead to memory bottlenecks during anomaly detection\ntraining. To address this, we introduce Sequential PatchCore - a method to\nbuild coresets sequentially and make training on large images using\nconsumer-grade hardware tractable. This allows us to perform transfer learning\nusing coresets pre-trained on different dataset versions. Our results show the\nbenefits of using synthetic data for pre-training an explicit coreset anomaly\nmodel and the extended performance benefits of finetuning the coreset using\nreal data. We observed how the impurities and labelling ambiguity lower the\nmodel performance and have additionally reported the defect-wise recall to\nprovide an industrially relevant perspective on model performance.",

Thus,\nFabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high\nfinesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is\ncreated by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be\nused to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling.\nAt the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser smoothing\nprocesses, without degrading the FIB milled shape.",

The fermionic classical shadow (FCS) method\noffers an efficient framework for estimating these observables without\nrequiring a transformation into a Pauli basis. However, the random matchgate\ncircuits in FCS require polynomial-depth circuits with a brickwork structure,\nwhich presents significant challenges for near-term quantum devices with\nlimited computational resources. To address this limitation, we introduce an\nadaptive-depth fermionic classical shadow (ADFCS) protocol designed to reduce\nthe circuit depth while maintaining the estimation accuracy and the order of\nsample complexity. Through theoretical analysis and numerical fitting, we\nestablish that the required depth for approximating a fermionic observable $H$\nscales as $\\max\\{d^2_{\\text{int}}(H)/\\log n, d_{\\text{int}}(H)\\}$ where\n$d_{\\text{int}}$ is the interaction distance of $H$. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the ADFCS protocol through numerical experiments, which show\nsimilar accuracy to the traditional FCS method while requiring significantly\nfewer resources. Additionally, we apply ADFCS to compute the expectation value\nof the Kitaev chain Hamiltonian, further validating its performance in\npractical scenarios.

In this work, we study a constrained hydrodynamical\nsimulation replica of the Virgo cluster to characterise the velocity field in\nthe two cosmic filaments connected to the cluster with unprecedented high\nresolution. First, we conduct a qualitative examination of slices extracted\nfrom the simulation.

    "abstract": "Conventional 2D human pose estimation methods typically require extensive\nlabeled annotations, which are both labor-intensive and expensive. In contrast,\nsemi-supervised 2D human pose estimation can alleviate the above problems by\nleveraging a large amount of unlabeled data along with a small portion of\nlabeled data. Existing semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation methods update\nthe network through backpropagation, ignoring crucial historical information\nfrom the previous training process. Therefore, we propose a novel\nsemi-supervised 2D human pose estimation method by utilizing a newly designed\nTeacher-Reviewer-Student framework. Specifically, we first mimic the phenomenon\nthat human beings constantly review previous knowledge for consolidation to\ndesign our framework, in which the teacher predicts results to guide the\nstudent's learning and the reviewer stores important historical parameters to\nprovide additional supervision signals. Secondly, we introduce a Multi-level\nFeature Learning strategy, which utilizes the outputs from different stages of\nthe backbone to estimate the heatmap to guide network training, enriching the\nsupervisory information while effectively capturing keypoint relationships.\nFinally, we design a data augmentation strategy, i.e., Keypoint-Mix, to perturb\npose information by mixing different keypoints, thus enhancing the network's\nability to discern keypoints. Extensive experiments on publicly available\ndatasets, demonstrate our method achieves significant improvements compared to\nthe existing methods.",

In such\ncases, the optimization problem is often treated as a black box in which only\nthe value of the objective function is required, sometimes with some indication\nof the measure of the violation of the constraints. Such problems have\ntraditionally been tackled through the use of direct search and meta-heuristic\nmethods. The challenge, then, is to determine which of these methods or\ncombination of methods should be considered to make most effective use of\nfinite computational resources.\n  This paper presents a multi-agent system for optimization which enables a set\nof solvers to be applied simultaneously to an optimization problem, including\ndifferent instantiations of any solver. The evaluation of the optimization\nproblem model is controlled by a scheduler agent which facilitates cooperation\nand competition between optimization methods. The architecture and\nimplementation of the agent system is described in detail, including the\nsolver, model evaluation, and scheduler agents. A suite of direct search and\nmeta-heuristic methods has been developed for use with this system.

The topic of iron and metallicity variations has recently attracted\nattention with the measurement of iron variations among the primordial\npopulation (P1) stars of Galactic GCs. We use the spectra of more than 8000 RGB\nstars in 21 Galactic GCs observed with MUSE to derive individual stellar\nmetallicities [M/H]. For each cluster, we use the HST photometric catalogs to\nseparate the stars into two main populations (P1 and P2). We measure the\nmetallicity spread within the primordial population of each cluster by\ncombining our metallicity measurements with the stars $\\Delta_{\\rm\nF275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color. We also derive metallicity dispersions\n($\\sigma_{\\rm [M/H]}$) for the P1 and P2 stars of each GC. In all but three\nGCs, we measure a significant correlation between the metallicity and the\n$\\Delta_{\\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color of the P1 stars such that stars with\nlarger $\\Delta_{\\rm F275W,F814W}$ have higher metallicities. We measure\nmetallicity spreads that range from 0.03 to 0.24 dex and correlate with the GC\nmasses. As for the intrinsic metallicity dispersions, when combining the P1 and\nP2 stars, we measure values ranging from 0.02 dex to 0.08 dex that correlate\nvery well with the GC masses. We compared the metallicity dispersion among the\nP1 and P2 stars and found that the P2 stars have metallicity dispersions that\nare smaller or equal to that of the P1 stars.

First, Few-shot selection-based\nmodality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings\nwith text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap.\nSecond, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder,\neliminating the need for paired image-text data.

We devised a film with a layered structure of bismuth\noxide that can stabilize the ferroelectric state down to 1 nanometer through\nsamarium bondage. This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a\ncost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard\nferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin\nfilms with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a\nrelatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square\ncentimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which\nalso pointed to the material being a lone pair-driven ferroelectric material.\nThe structure design of the ultrathin ferroelectric films has great potential\nfor the manufacturing of atomic-scale electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), a technique combining phase imaging and\nmicroscopy, enables visualization of the 3D topography in reflective samples,\nas well as the inner structure or refractive index distribution of transparent\nand translucent samples. Similar to other imaging modalities, QPM is\nconstrained by the conflict between numerical aperture (NA) and field of view\n(FOV): an imaging system with a low NA has to be employed to maintain a large\nFOV. This fact severely limits the resolution in QPM up to being the\nillumination wavelength. Consequently, finer structures of samples cannot be\nresolved by using modest NA objectives in QPM. Aimed to that, many approaches,\nsuch as oblique illumination, structured illumination, and speckle illumination\n(just to cite a few), have been proposed to improve the spatial resolution (or\nthe space bandwidth product) in phase microscopy by restricting other degrees\nof freedom (mostly time). This paper aims to provide an up to date review on\nthe resolution enhancement approaches in QPM, discussing the pros and cons of\neach technique as well as the confusion on resolution definition claims on QPM\nand other coherent microscopy methods. Through this survey, we will review the\nmost appealing and useful techniques for superresolution in coherent\nmicroscopy, working with and without lenses and with special attention to QPM.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density\npatterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves\nappearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important\nas they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in\nheterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in\nsimplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are\nexternally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing\nexample, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential\nformation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal\npopulation. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained\nobscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in\nsimplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and\ntiming of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of\ndifferent bands can be modulated independently. This \"modularity\" is suggested\nby the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it\nis reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal\nmetabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also\nmodify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that\nimpair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise\nmeasurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the\n\"proliferation pattern formation\" phenomenon, can make it a model system to\nstudy the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.",

Our calculations suggest that $^{39}$Ti\nis indeed a viable candidate for 2$p$ emission.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we elaborate on how AI can support diversity and inclusion and\nexemplify research projects conducted in that direction. We start by looking at\nthe challenges and progress in making large language models (LLMs) more\ntransparent, inclusive, and aware of social biases. Even though LLMs like\nChatGPT have impressive abilities, they struggle to understand different\ncultural contexts and engage in meaningful, human like conversations. A key\nissue is that biases in language processing, especially in machine translation,\ncan reinforce inequality. Tackling these biases requires a multidisciplinary\napproach to ensure AI promotes diversity, fairness, and inclusion. We also\nhighlight AI's role in identifying biased content in media, which is important\nfor improving representation. By detecting unequal portrayals of social groups,\nAI can help challenge stereotypes and create more inclusive technologies.\nTransparent AI algorithms, which clearly explain their decisions, are essential\nfor building trust and reducing bias in AI systems. We also stress AI systems\nneed diverse and inclusive training data. Projects like the Child Growth\nMonitor show how using a wide range of data can help address real world\nproblems like malnutrition and poverty. We present a project that demonstrates\nhow AI can be applied to monitor the role of search engines in spreading\ndisinformation about the LGBTQ+ community. Moreover, we discuss the SignON\nproject as an example of how technology can bridge communication gaps between\nhearing and deaf people, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and mutual\ntrust in developing inclusive AI. Overall, with this paper, we advocate for AI\nsystems that are not only effective but also socially responsible, promoting\nfair and inclusive interactions between humans and machines.",

While\nmulti-user (MU)-MIMO technology aims to improve spectral efficiency by enabling\nconcurrent transmissions over the same frequency and time resources,\ntraditional linear processing methods fall short of fully utilizing available\nchannel capacity. These methods require a substantial number of antennas and RF\nchains, to support a much smaller number of MIMO streams, leading to increased\npower consumption and operational costs, even when the supported streams are of\nlow rate. In this demo, we present NL-COMM, an advanced non-linear MIMO\nprocessing framework, demonstrated for the first time with commercial\noff-the-shelf (COTS) user equipment (UEs) in a fully 3GPP-compliant\nenvironment. In addition, also for the first time, the audience will compare\nand assess the quality of live, over-the-air video transmission from four\nconcurrently transmitting UE devices, alternating between current\nstate-of-the-art MIMO detection algorithms and NL-COMM.

However, such approaches result in a large number\nof redundant visual tokens, thus significantly reducing the efficiency of the\nVLMs. To improve the VLMs' efficiency without introducing extra training costs,\nmany research works are proposed to reduce the visual tokens by filtering the\nuninformative visual tokens or aggregating their information.

The token reduction\napproaches solely rely on visual cues are text-agnostic, and fail to focus on\nthe areas that are most relevant to the question, especially when the queried\nobjects are non-salient to the image. In this work, we first conduct\nexperiments to show that the original text embeddings are aligned with the\nvisual tokens, without bias on the tailed visual tokens.

    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of round surgery diagrams in $S^3$ for representing\n3-manifolds similar to Dehn surgery diagrams. We give a correspondence between\na certain class of round surgery diagrams and Dehn surgery diagrams for\n3-manifolds. As a consequence, we recover Asimov's result, stating that any\nclosed connected oriented 3-manifold can be obtained by a round surgery on a\nframed link in $S^3$. There may be more than one round surgery diagram giving\nrise to the same 3-manifold. Thus, it is natural to ask whether there is a\nversion of Kirby Calculus for round surgery diagrams, similar to the case of\nDehn surgery diagrams with integral framings. In this direction, we define four\ntypes of moves on round surgery diagrams such that any two round surgery\ndiagrams corresponding to the same 3-manifold can be obtained one from another\nby a finite sequence of these moves, thereby establishing a version of Kirby\nCalculus. As an application, we prove the existence of taut foliations, hence\nthe existence of tight contact structures on 3-manifolds obtained by round\n1-surgery on fibred links with two components on $S^3$.",

    "abstract": "Quality-of-service (QoS) data exhibit dynamic temporal patterns that are\ncrucial for accurately predicting missing values. These patterns arise from the\nevolving interactions between users and services, making it essential to\ncapture the temporal dynamics inherent in such data for improved prediction\nperformance. As the size and complexity of QoS datasets increase, existing\nmodels struggle to provide accurate predictions, highlighting the need for more\nflexible and dynamic methods to better capture the underlying patterns in\nlarge-scale QoS data. To address this issue, we introduce a neural\nnetwork-based tensor factorization approach tailored for learning\nspatiotemporal representations of high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI)\ntensors, namely the Multi-head Self-attending Neural Tucker Factorization\n(MSNTucF). The model is elaborately designed for modeling intricate nonlinear\nspatiotemporal feature interaction patterns hidden in real world data with a\ntwo-fold idea. It first employs a neural network structure to generalize the\ntraditional framework of Tucker factorization and then proposes to leverage a\nmulti-head self-attending module to enforce nonlinear latent interaction\nlearning. In empirical studies on two dynamic QoS datasets from real\napplications, the proposed MSNTucF model demonstrates superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art benchmark models in estimating missing\nobservations. This highlights its ability to learn non-linear spatiotemporal\nrepresentations of HDI tensors.",

Subsequently, we compare different deep\nlearning strategies utilised in COVID-19 analysis, evaluating them based on\nmethodology, data, performance, and prerequisites for future research. By\nexamining diverse data types and diagnostic modalities, this research\ncontributes to scientific understanding and knowledge of the multimodal\napplication of DL and its effectiveness in diagnosis. We have implemented and\nanalysed 11 deep learning models using COVID-19 image, text, and speech (ie,\ncough) data. Our analysis revealed that the MobileNet model achieved the\nhighest accuracy of 99.97% for COVID-19 image data and 93.73% for speech data\n(i.e., cough). However, the BiGRU model demonstrated superior performance in\nCOVID-19 text classification with an accuracy of 99.89%. The broader\nimplications of this research suggest potential benefits for other domains and\ndisciplines that could leverage deep learning techniques for image, text, and\nspeech analysis.",

The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the\ncomplexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems.\nHowever, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle\ncorrelators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine\nlearning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from\na reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted\nsystem is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a\ntransfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced\nset of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the\ntraining set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide\nvariety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and\nrepulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field,\nand spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning\nmethodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during\ntheir training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate\nthat correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally\nwithout requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.",

In this paper, we propose\nAnyStory, a unified approach for personalized subject generation. AnyStory not\nonly achieves high-fidelity personalization for single subjects, but also for\nmultiple subjects, without sacrificing subject fidelity. Specifically, AnyStory\nmodels the subject personalization problem in an \"encode-then-route\" manner. In\nthe encoding step, AnyStory utilizes a universal and powerful image encoder,\ni.e., ReferenceNet, in conjunction with CLIP vision encoder to achieve\nhigh-fidelity encoding of subject features. In the routing step, AnyStory\nutilizes a decoupled instance-aware subject router to accurately perceive and\npredict the potential location of the corresponding subject in the latent\nspace, and guide the injection of subject conditions. Detailed experimental\nresults demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in retaining\nsubject details, aligning text descriptions, and personalizing for multiple\nsubjects.

Due to the complexity of emotions and their multi-modal nature\n(e.g., emotions are influenced by facial expressions and audio), researchers\nhave turned to using multi-modal models to understand human emotions rather\nthan single-modality. However, current video multi-modal large language models\n(MLLMs) encounter difficulties in effectively integrating audio and identifying\nsubtle facial micro-expressions. Furthermore, the lack of detailed emotion\nanalysis datasets also limits the development of multimodal emotion analysis.\nTo address these issues, we introduce a self-reviewed dataset and a\nhuman-reviewed dataset, comprising 24,137 coarse-grained samples and 3,500\nmanually annotated samples with detailed emotion annotations, respectively.\nThese datasets allow models to learn from diverse scenarios and better\ngeneralize to real-world applications. Moreover, in addition to the audio\nmodeling, we propose to explicitly integrate facial encoding models into the\nexisting advanced Video MLLM, enabling the MLLM to effectively unify audio and\nthe subtle facial cues for emotion understanding.

For\nover a decade, HRDS has focused on hot Jupiters (close-orbiting gas giants) due\nto their high signal-to-noise ratio, which makes them ideal laboratories for\nadvancing our knowledge. However, there have been concerns regarding potential\nbiases in exo-atmospheric-detection methods, hindering comparative planetology.\nHere we propose a modeling framework based on extensive simulations of HRDS\nexo-atmospheric observations to systematically explore in-silico underlying\nbiases in commonly-used pipelines, particularly under the presence of\nobservational noise. Our findings show that exo-atmospheric\ndetection-significances are highly contingent on details of the\nanalysis-pipeline used, with different techniques responding differently to\nnoise: A given technique may fail to recover a true-signal that is detected by\nanother. Noise effects in the computed significances are non-trivial and\npipeline-dependent.

CoRE consists of two main components: (1) LLM-As-Evaluator. Firstly, we\ncomprehensively summarize 12 key factors influencing user experience in CRSs\nand directly leverage LLM as an evaluator to assign a score to each factor. (2)\nMulti-Agent Debater. Secondly, we design a multi-agent debate framework with\nfour distinct roles (common user, domain expert, linguist, and HCI expert) to\ndiscuss and synthesize the 12 evaluation factors into a unified overall\nperformance score.\n  Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to evaluate four CRSs on two\nbenchmark datasets. The experimental results show that CoRE aligns well with\nhuman evaluation in most of the 12 factors and the overall assessment.\nEspecially, CoRE's overall evaluation scores demonstrate significantly better\nalignment with human feedback compared to existing rule-based metrics.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of the origin of gamma-ray emissions in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nremains an enigma. Through a joint analysis of GRB 180427A, observed by the\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and AstroSat's Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager,\nwe identify emissions from two distinct regions with varying polarisation\nproperties. Time-resolved polarisation analysis reveals a synchronous evolution\nof the polarisation angle (PA) and fraction (PF) with two emission pulses,\npeaking with a delay of $ 5.09 \\pm 0.29\\, \\mathrm{s}$. Spectral analysis\nindicates that the first pulse is characterised by a stronger blackbody\ncomponent, while the second pulse exhibits a more prominent non-thermal\nspectrum (power law with an exponential cutoff). Using a bottom-to-top approach\nthrough simulations, we decouple the polarisation properties of the individual\nspectral components, revealing polarisation fractions of 25\\% - 40\\% for the\nblackbody spectrum and 30\\% - 60\\% for the non-thermal spectrum. At a redshift\nof $z \\sim 0.22$, the blackbody emission originates from the jet photosphere at\n$\\sim$ a few $10^{11}\\, \\mathrm{cm}$, whereas the non-thermal emission arises\nfrom an optically thin region at a few $10^{13}\\, \\mathrm{cm}$. The changing\ndominance of these emissions explains the observed PA shift of $60^\\circ \\pm\n22^\\circ$. The spectral cutoff at 1 MeV suggests pair opacity due to the jet's\nrelatively lower bulk Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma \\sim$ a few tens). The high\npolarisation fraction and hard low energy spectral slopes ($\\alpha > -0.5$)\nimply a top-hat jet structure observed off-axis, near the jet's edge. This\noff-axis viewing introduces anisotropy in the observed radiation within the\nviewing cone ($1/\\Gamma$), accounting for the observed polarisation.",

Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an\nexact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum\ngravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small\ncurvature limit.

    "abstract": "Inference on the parametric part of a semiparametric model is no trivial\ntask. On the other hand, if one approximates the infinite dimensional part of\nthe semiparametric model by a parametric function, one obtains a parametric\nmodel that is in some sense close to the semiparametric model; and inference\nmay proceed by the method of maximum likelihood. Under regularity conditions,\nand assuming that the approximating parametric model in fact generated the\ndata, the ensuing maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically normal and\nefficient (in the approximating parametric model). Thus one obtains a sequence\nof asymptotically normal and efficient estimators in a sequence of growing\nparametric models that approximate the semiparametric model and, intuitively,\nthe limiting {`}semiparametric{'} estimator should be asymptotically normal and\nefficient as well. In this paper we make this intuition rigorous. Consequently,\nwe are able to move much of the semiparametric analysis back into classical\nparametric terrain, and then translate our parametric results back to the\nsemiparametric world by way of contiguity. Our approach departs from the sieve\nliterature by being more specific about the approximating parametric models, by\nworking under these when treating the parametric models, and by taking\nadvantage of the mutual contiguity between the parametric and semiparametric\nmodels to lift conclusions about the former to conclusions about the latter. We\nillustrate our theory with two canonical examples of semiparametric models,\nnamely the partially linear regression model and the Cox regression model.

    "abstract": "The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various aspects of\nurban life, including, governance, policy and planning, healthcare,\nsustainability, economics, entrepreneurship, etc. Although AI immense potential\nfor positively impacting urban living, its success depends on overcoming\nsignificant challenges, particularly in telecommunications infrastructure.\nSmart city applications, such as, federated learning, Internet of Things (IoT),\nand online financial services, require reliable Quality of Service (QoS) from\ntelecommunications networks to ensure effective information transfer. However,\nwith over three billion people underserved or lacking access to internet, many\nof these AI-driven applications are at risk of either remaining underutilized\nor failing altogether. Furthermore, many IoT and video-based applications in\ndensely populated urban areas require high-quality connectivity. This paper\nexplores these issues, focusing on the challenges that need to be mitigated to\nmake AI succeed in emerging countries, where more than 80% of the world\npopulation resides and urban migration grows. In this context, an overview of a\ncase study conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal, highlights citizens' aspirations for\naffordable, high-quality internet-based services. The findings underscore the\npressing need for advanced telecommunication networks to meet diverse user\nrequirements while addressing investment and infrastructure gaps. This\ndiscussion provides insights into bridging the digital divide and enabling AI's\ntransformative potential in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems\nstill defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum\nmany-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization\nto give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars\nfrom the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it\nremains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to\ndistinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we\nintroduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher\nzeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition\nfunction $Z$ on the complex $\\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems\nwith scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary\n$\\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\\beta$ plane into regions with\ndistinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from\ninterpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double\nstate, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the\n$\\bar{P}X\\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models\nalso illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking\nincluding their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\\beta$\nplane. This ``statistical mechanics\" approach places QMBS within the same\nframework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of\nspotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.",

Public authorities typically impose economic\npolicies, including road taxes and subsidies for scheduled line services, to\nachieve this modal shift. This study models such a policy using a bi-level\napproach: at the upper level, authorities set road taxes and scheduled line\nsubsidies, while at the lower level, freight forwarders arrange transportation\nvia road or a combination of road and scheduled lines. We prove that fully\nsubsidizing the scheduled line is an optimal and budget-efficient policy. Due\nto its computational complexity, we solve the problem heuristically using a\nbi-section algorithm for the upper level and an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood\nSearch for the lower level. Our results show that optimally setting subsidy and\ntax can reduce the driving distance by up to 12.5\\% and substantially increase\nmodal shift, albeit at a higher operational cost due to increased taxes.\nFurthermore, increased scheduled line frequency and decreased geographical\nscatteredness of freight orders increase modal shift. For the partial subsidy\npolicy, we found that an additional budget provides a better trade-off between\nminimizing distance and transportation costs than solely increasing the subsidy\nlevel. In a Berlin, Germany, case study, we find that we can achieve up to\n2.9\\% reduction in driven distance due to 23.2\\% scheduled line usage, which\namounts to an increase of multiple orders of magnitude, despite only using a\nfew stations for transshipment.",

MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on\nalmost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To\nhelp the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the\nprompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the\nselected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer,\nwhich is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the\nselected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated\nprobability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in\nthe response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer\ndepends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide\nthe reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a\nwide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more\nconfident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This\noccurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is\nthat this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the\nselected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and\nthe reasoning that supports the selection made. Therefore, LLM estimated\nprobabilities seem to have intrinsic limitations that should be understood in\norder to use them in evaluation procedures.

Contrary to earlier reconstructions by Becker, van der Waerden and Knorr,\nour reconstruction reveals a theory that (a) applies only to the restricted\nclass of pairs of magnitudes whose anthyphairesis is finite or eventually\nperiodic, and (b) avoids the problematic use of Eudoxus' definition 4 of Book V\nof Euclid's Elements.\n  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the book Essays\non Topology: Dedicated to Valentin Po\\'enaru, ed.

The resulting models from each stage, $\\Delta$CLIP\nand $\\Delta^2$LLaVA, show substantially enhanced zero-shot robustness and set a\nnew state-of-the-art in adversarial defense for vision-language models. For\nexample, the adversarial robustness of $\\Delta$CLIP surpasses that of the\nprevious best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20%. %For example, $\\Delta$CLIP\nsurpasses the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20% in terms of\nadversarial robustness. Similarly, compared to prior art, $\\Delta^2$LLaVA\nbrings a ~30% robustness improvement to image captioning task and a ~20%\nrobustness improvement to visual question answering task.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's\nbilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all\nwritten statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the\nBasic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal,\nlinguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and\nculturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law\nremains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth\nof judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys\nsporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with\nthe thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the\ngovernment acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a\nsustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that\ntranslating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis\nanalyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A\nproposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a\nhuman-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major\ntransitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to\nusing a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it\nevolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating\nTranslator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach,\nsupported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of\njudicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and\ncontinuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual\nlegal system.",

Accordingly, participants\nwere tasked with memorizing Tagalog--Japanese word pairs.

This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides\n(HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by\nkeeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was\ndesigned and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium,\nzirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium).

It exhibited UV and visible light\nabsorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole\nrecombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations.\nIt successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2\nconversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst\naddition.

Subsequently, leveraging a novel,\nmodel-agnostic Spatially Decoupled Attention, the framework synthesizes\nhigh-resolution textures (up to 4K) for a given geometry. Furthermore, we\npropose a 3D-aware occlusion inpainting algorithm that fills untextured\nregions, resulting in cohesive results across the entire model. This pipeline\ngenerates high-quality 3D assets in less than 30 seconds, providing\nready-to-use outputs for commercial applications. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CaPa excels in both texture fidelity and geometric stability,\nestablishing a new standard for practical, scalable 3D asset generation.",

However, ABMs have long suffered from the Lucas\ncritique, stating that agent behaviour should adapt to environmental changes.\nFurthermore, the environment itself often adapts to these behavioural changes,\ncreating a complex bi-level adaptation problem. Recent progress integrating\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning into ABMs introduces adaptive agent\nbehaviour, beginning to address the first part of this critique, however, the\napproaches are still relatively ad hoc, lacking a general formulation, and\nfurthermore, do not tackle the second aspect of simultaneously adapting\nenvironmental level characteristics in addition to the agent behaviours. In\nthis work, we develop a generic two-layer framework for ADaptive AGEnt based\nmodelling (ADAGE) for addressing these problems. This framework formalises the\nbi-level problem as a Stackelberg game with conditional behavioural policies,\nproviding a consolidated framework for adaptive agent-based modelling based on\nsolving a coupled set of non-linear equations. We demonstrate how this generic\napproach encapsulates several common (previously viewed as distinct) ABM tasks,\nsuch as policy design, calibration, scenario generation, and robust behavioural\nlearning under one unified framework.

In elastic turbulence, reducing Reynolds number\nincreases uncertainty at short times, but does not significantly influence the\ngrowth of uncertainty at later times.

A naive implementation is exponential, and to obtain an optimal\nquadratic runtime, we optimize the implementation by memoizing its results and\nsimulating reference equality testing. We leverage the resulting correctness\ntheorem to implement a reflective Coq tactic.

Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically\nrelevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as\nwell as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum\ngradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the\nlogarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator\nmay be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum\nstate--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished\nin $O(k\\sigma)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the\ninput matrix.

Structured pruning has emerged as an effective model compression\nmethod that can reduce these demands while preserving performance. In this\npaper, we introduce FASP (Fast and Accurate Structured Pruning), a novel\nstructured pruning framework for LLMs that emphasizes both speed and accuracy.\nFASP employs a distinctive pruning structure that interlinks sequential layers,\nallowing for the removal of columns in one layer while simultaneously\neliminating corresponding rows in the preceding layer without incurring\nadditional performance loss. The pruning metric, inspired by Wanda, is\ncomputationally efficient and effectively selects components to prune.\nAdditionally, we propose a restoration mechanism that enhances model fidelity\nby adjusting the remaining weights post-pruning. We evaluate FASP on the OPT\nand LLaMA model families, demonstrating superior performance in terms of\nperplexity and accuracy on downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.

    "abstract": "I introduce an agent-based model of a Perpetual Futures market with\nheterogeneous agents trading via a central limit order book. Perpetual Futures\n(henceforth Perps) are financial derivatives introduced by the economist Robert\nShiller, designed to peg their price to that of the underlying Spot market.\nThis paper extends the limit order book model of Chiarella et al. (2002) by\ntaking their agent and orderbook parameters, designed for a simple stock\nexchange, and applying it to the more complex environment of a Perp market with\nlong and short traders who exhibit both positional and basis-trading behaviors.\nI find that despite the simplicity of the agent behavior, the simulation is\nable to reproduce the most salient feature of a Perp market, the pegging of the\nPerp price to the underlying Spot price. In contrast to fundamental simulations\nof stock markets which aim to reproduce empirically observed stylized facts\nsuch as the leptokurtosis and heteroscedasticity of returns, volatility\nclustering and others, in derivatives markets many of these features are\nprovided exogenously by the underlying Spot price signal. This is especially\ntrue of Perps since the derivative is designed to mimic the price of the Spot\nmarket. Therefore, this paper will focus exclusively on analyzing how market\nand agent parameters such as order lifetime, trading horizon and spread affect\nthe premiums at which Perps trade with respect to the underlying Spot market. I\nshow that this simulation provides a simple and robust environment for\nexploring the dynamics of Perpetual Futures markets and their microstructure in\nthis regard. Lastly, I explore the ability of the model to reproduce the\neffects of biasing long traders to trade positionally and short traders to\nbasis-trade, which was the original intention behind the market design, and is\na tendency observed empirically in real Perp markets.",

To address this, we introduce a\nnovel self-supervised k-space loss function $\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{PISCO}$,\napplicable for regularization of NIK-based reconstructions. The proposed loss\nfunction is based on the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency\n(PISCO), enforcing a consistent global k-space neighborhood relationship\nwithout requiring additional data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on\nstatic and dynamic MR reconstructions show that integrating PISCO significantly\nimproves NIK representations. Particularly for high acceleration factors\n(R$\\geq$54), NIK with PISCO achieves superior spatio-temporal reconstruction\nquality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

CUDA Graph\naddresses these performance challenges by enabling a graph-based execution\nmodel that captures operations as nodes and dependence as edges in a static\ngraph. Thereby consolidating several kernel launches into one graph launch. We\npropose a performance optimization strategy for iteratively launched kernels.\nBy grouping kernel launches into iteration batches and then unrolling these\nbatches into a CUDA Graph, iterative applications can benefit from CUDA Graph\nfor performance boosting. We analyze the performance gain and overhead from\nthis approach by designing a skeleton application. The skeleton application\nalso serves as a generalized example of converting an iterative solver to CUDA\nGraph, and for deriving a performance model. Using the skeleton application, we\nshow that when unrolling iteration batches for a given platform, there is an\noptimal size of the iteration batch, which is independent of workload,\nbalancing the extra overhead from graph creation with the performance gain of\nthe graph execution. Depending on workload, we show that the optimal iteration\nbatch size gives more than 1.4x speed-up in the skeleton application.\nFurthermore, we show that similar speed-up can be gained in Hotspot and\nHotspot3D from the Rodinia benchmark suite and a Finite-Difference Time-Domain\n(FDTD) Maxwell solver.",

Event cameras, which asynchronously record\npixel intensity changes with extremely low latency, have shown great potential\nfor motion deblurring tasks.

By applying linear spin wave theory, we\nuncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely\nsensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show\nthat both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport\nproperties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the\ndirection and magnitude of the external magnetic field.

However, the\norigin of these structures, particularly in the envelope, has not been\nextensively studied. We study the origin of structures seen in 2D unified\nstellar atmosphere and wind simulations of O stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.\nParticularly, we study whether the structure growth in the simulations is\nconsistent with sub-surface convection, as is commonly assumed to be the origin\nof this turbulence. Using a linear stability analysis of the optically thick\nenvelopes of massive stars, we identified multiple instabilities that could\ndrive structure growth. We quantified the structure growth in the non-linear\nsimulations of O stars and WR stars by computing density power spectra and\ntracking their temporal evolution. Then, we compared these results to the\nanalytical results from the stability analysis. The stability analysis leads to\ntwo possible instabilities: the convective instability and an acoustic\ninstability. Analytic expressions for the growth rates of these different\ninstabilities are found. In particular, strong radiative diffusion damps the\ngrowth rate $\\omega$ of the convective instability leading to a distinct\n$\\omega \\sim 1/k^2$ dependence on wavenumber $k$. From our power spectra\nanalysis of the simulations, however, we find that structure growth rather\nincreases with $k$ - tentatively as $\\omega \\sim \\sqrt{k}$. Our results suggest\nthat structures in luminous O and WR star envelopes do not primarily develop\nfrom the sub-surface convective instability. Rather the growth seems compatible\nwith either the acoustic instability in the radiation-dominated regime or with\nRayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, although the exact origin remains\ninconclusive for now.",

However,\nusually SMPs lose their unidirectionality due to non-local effects, especially\nin the lower trivial bandgap of such structures. More recently, a truly\nunidirectional SMP (USMP) has been demonstrated in the upper topological\nnon-trivial bandgap, but it supports only a single USMP, limiting its\nfunctionality. In this work, we present a fundamental physical model for\nmultiple, robust, truly topological USMP modes at terahertz (THz) frequencies,\nrealized in a semiconductor-dielectric-semiconductor (SDS) slab waveguide under\nopposing external magnetic fields. We analytically derive the dispersion\nproperties of the SMPs and perform numerical analysis in both local and\nnon-local models. Our results show that the SDS waveguide supports two truly\n(even and odd) USMP modes in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap.\nExploiting these two modes, we demonstrate unidirectional SMP multimode\ninterference (USMMI), being highly robust and immune to backscattering,\novercoming the back-reflection issue in conventional bidirectional waveguides.\nTo demonstrate the usefullness of this approach, we numerically realize a\nfrequency- and magnetically-tunable arbitrary-ratio splitter based on this\nrobust USMMI, enabling multimode conversion. We, further, identify a unique\nindex-near-zero (INZ) odd USMP mode in the SDS waveguide, distinct from\nconventional semiconductor-dielectric-metal waveguides.

We reformulate the tree-level\nmaximally-helicity-violating (MHV) celestial leaf amplitudes for gluons in\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and for gravitons in\n$\\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity in terms of minitwistor wavefunctions. These are\ndefined as representatives of cohomology classes on the minitwistor space\n$\\mathbf{MT}$, associated to the three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter\nspace. In this framework, celestial leaf amplitudes are expressed as integrals\nover the moduli space of minitwistor lines. We construct a minitwistor\ngenerating functional for MHV leaf amplitudes using the Quillen determinant\nline bundle, extending the approach originally developed by Boels, Mason and\nSkinner. Building on this formalism, we propose supersymmetric celestial\nconformal field theories (CFTs) as $\\sigma$-models, where the worldsheet is\ngiven by the celestial supersphere $\\mathbf{CP}^{1|2}$, and the target space is\nthe minitwistor superspace $\\mathbf{MT}^{2|\\mathcal{N}}$.

This study has\nbeen conducted with 21m single-dish radio telescopes of the Korean VLBI Network\nfrom 2009 June to 2021 June. Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2,\nJ=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO\nmaser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting\nan asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O\nmaser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The\nintensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the\noptical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the\nphase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO\nmasers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O\nmaser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms\nare different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant\nsingle-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars.\nHowever, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a\nradial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted\nvelocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving\noutward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material\nejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial\nasymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic\ngiant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.",

Augmented\nReality (AR) head worn devices can uniquely improve the user experience of\nsolving procedural day-to-day tasks by providing egocentric multimodal (audio\nand video) observational capabilities to AI Agents. Such AR capabilities can\nhelp AI Agents see and listen to actions that users take which can relate to\nmultimodal capabilities of human users. Existing AI Agents, either Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) or Multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reactive\nin nature, which means that models cannot take an action without reading or\nlistening to the human user's prompts. Proactivity of AI Agents on the other\nhand can help the human user detect and correct any mistakes in agent observed\ntasks, encourage users when they do tasks correctly or simply engage in\nconversation with the user - akin to a human teaching or assisting a user. Our\nproposed YET to Intervene (YETI) multimodal agent focuses on the research\nquestion of identifying circumstances that may require the agent to intervene\nproactively. This allows the agent to understand when it can intervene in a\nconversation with human users that can help the user correct mistakes on tasks,\nlike cooking, using AR. Our YETI Agent learns scene understanding signals based\non interpretable notions of Structural Similarity (SSIM) on consecutive video\nframes. We also define the alignment signal which the AI Agent can learn to\nidentify if the video frames corresponding to the user's actions on the task\nare consistent with expected actions. These signals are used by our AI Agent to\ndetermine when it should proactively intervene. We compare our results on the\ninstances of proactive intervention in the HoloAssist multimodal benchmark for\nan expert agent guiding a user to complete procedural tasks.",

In this experimental and theoretical study, we reveal how the\nmacroscopic deformation of MAEs relates to the process of particle\nrestructuring caused by application of a magnetic field. For this purpose, MAE\ncylinders with different aspect ratios and particle loadings are studied in\nuniform magnetic fields. The axial deformations of the cylinders are acquired\nusing an optical camera. A unified mean-field model proposed in previous\nstudies is adapted to describe the transition of initially isotropic cylinders\ninto transversely isotropic ones. This mechanical transition is caused by the\nrearrangement of particles into dense columnar structures aligned with the\nfield and is believed to result in a huge magnetorheological effect. Our model\nhowever predicts less than three-fold increase in elastic moduli when evaluated\nalong the field direction. This prediction is based on a careful examination of\nthe shear moduli of studied MAEs and the columnar structures. A weak\nmagnetorheological effect explains significant axial deformations measured in\nthe field direction. A strong magnetorheological effect would hinder axial\ndeformations due to an increase in modulus by several orders of magnitude. Not\nonly are the moduli and macroscopic deformations influenced by microstructure\nevolution, but so is the magnetization of particles, which increases as they\nrearrange into dense columns. With this study, we show that the unified\nmean-field model provides quantitative access to hidden material properties\nsuch as magnetization and stiffness in MAE samples with different shapes and\nevolving microstructures.",

Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well\nas their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to\npredict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more\ncomplex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each\nmodel's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of\ndifferent models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for\nthe joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a\nframework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade\nusing continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds\nusing Bayesian optimization, our parametric Markov-copula model yields more\nfavorable error-cost trade-offs, improving the area under the error-cost curve\nby 4.3% on average for cascades with $k\\geq 3$ models. In the low-sample regime\nwith $n \\leq 30$ training examples, the performance improvement widens to\n10.2%, suggesting that our framework's inductive assumptions about the\ninteractions between the error rates of different LLMs enhance sample\nefficiency. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for\ntuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic\nmethods in analyzing systems of LLMs.",

In ViSAR, the moving targets' shadows will\nnot offset and defocus, which is widely used as a feature for MTD. However, the\nshadows are difficult to distinguish from the low scattering region in the\nbackground, which will cause more missing and false alarms. Therefore, it is\nworth investigating how to enhance the distinction between the shadows and\nbackground. In this study, we proposed the Shadow Enhancement and Background\nSuppression for ViSAR (SE-BSFV) algorithm. The SE-BSFV algorithm is based on\nthe low-rank representation (LRR) theory and adopts online subspace learning\ntechnique to enhance shadows and suppress background for ViSAR images. Firstly,\nwe use a registration algorithm to register the ViSAR images and utilize\nGaussian mixture distribution (GMD) to model the ViSAR data. Secondly, the\nknowledge learned from the previous frames is leveraged to estimate the GMD\nparameters of the current frame, and the Expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm is used to estimate the subspace parameters. Then, the foreground\nmatrix of the current frame can be obtained. Finally, the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) is used to eliminate strong scattering objects in\nthe foreground matrix to obtain the final results. The experimental results\nindicate that the SE-BSFV algorithm significantly enhances the shadows'\nsaliency and greatly improves the detection performance while ensuring\nefficiency compared with several other advanced pre-processing algorithms.",

Concentration-driven evaporation plays a major role in mitigating\nthis corrosion. Accurate evaporation rate predictions are crucial for improved\nproduct design. However, simulating capillary-driven flows with evaporation in\ncomplex geometries is challenging, requiring consideration of surface tension,\nwetting, and phase-change effects. Traditional approaches, such as the\nVolume-of-Fluid method, are prone to curvature calculation errors and have long\nsimulation times due to strict time step limitations. This study introduces a\nnovel semi-transient simulation approach for fast evaporation rate prediction\nin arbitrarily shaped cavities. The approach involves a unidirectional coupling\ncircuit, simulating the fluid surface in Surface Evolver and combining it with\na vapor-in-gas diffusion simulation in OpenFOAM.

These processes are often characterized by time-varying\ndynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system\nundergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems\nanomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD)\nexhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this\nphenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic\nprocess, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations.\nAlthough FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes\nwith FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we\nstudy the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM),\na model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal\ncorrelations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the\nkurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal\ndistribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered\nheterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify\nnon-Gaussian behavior.

    "abstract": "A machine learning tasks from observations must encounter and process\nuncertainty and novelty, especially when it is to maintain performance when\nobserving new information and to choose the hypothesis that best fits the\ncurrent observations. In this context, some key questions arise: what and how\nmuch information did the observations provide, how much information is required\nto identify the data-generating process, how many observations remain to get\nthat information, and how does a predictor determine that it has observed novel\ninformation? This paper strengthens existing answers to these questions by\nformalizing the notion of identifiable information that arises from the\nlanguage used to express the relationship between distinct states. Model\nidentifiability and sample complexity are defined via computation of an\nindicator function over a set of hypotheses, bridging algorithmic and\nprobabilistic information. Their properties and asymptotic statistics are\ndescribed for data-generating processes ranging from deterministic processes to\nergodic stationary stochastic processes. This connects the notion of\nidentifying information in finite steps with asymptotic statistics and\nPAC-learning. The indicator function's computation naturally formalizes novel\ninformation and its identification from observations with respect to a\nhypothesis set. We also proved that computable PAC-Bayes learners' sample\ncomplexity distribution is determined by its moments in terms of the prior\nprobability distribution over a fixed finite hypothesis set.",

The latter are frequently encountered in\neconomics, financial markets, crowd dynamics, congestion analysis,\nepidemiology, and population ecology, among other fields. Our two primary\ncontributions are as follows. First, we present a way to represent strategy\nprofiles for an infinite number of players, which we name a Player-to-Strategy\nNetwork (P2SN). Such a network maps players to strategies, and exploits the\ngeneralization capabilities of neural networks to learn across an infinite\nnumber of inputs (players) simultaneously. Second, we present an algorithm,\nwhich we name Shared-Parameter Simultaneous Gradient (SPSG), for training such\na network, with the goal of finding an approximate Nash equilibrium. This\nalgorithm generalizes simultaneous gradient ascent and its variants, which are\nclassical equilibrium-seeking dynamics used for multiagent reinforcement\nlearning. We test our approach on infinite-player games and observe its\nconvergence to approximate Nash equilibria. Our method can handle games with\ninfinitely many states, infinitely many players, infinitely many actions (and\nmixed strategies on them), and discontinuous utility functions.",

The algorithm\noperates in two phases: first, utilizing K-Means clustering, it divides the\ndataset into distinct subsets we refer to as \"villages\". Next, a weighted\nnetwork is created, with each node representing a village, capturing their\nproximity relationships.

For this purpose, first, we evaluate the effect of\nthe bumblebee field (or Lorentz-violating parameter) on the event horizon for\nAdS black holes. Then, in non-extended phase space, we study the effect of the\nbumblebee field on the heat capacity and the Helmholtz free energy to\ninvestigate the local and global thermal stability areas, respectively. Next,\nwe extend our study on the extended phase space by seeking on stable area by\nusing the heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_{P}$). Finally, we evaluate\nthe super-entropy black hole condition and indicate that the bumblebee AdS\nblack holes are super-entropy black holes when $l>0$, which is consistent with\nthe condition $C_{P}<0$.",

The typical method is identifying the\ncrystalline phase from the coincidence of the main diffraction peaks.

If multiple candidates are obtained, the researcher must\nsubjectively select the crystalline phases. Thus, the identification results\ndepend on the researcher's experience and knowledge of materials science. To\nsolve this problem, we have developed a Bayesian estimation method to identify\nthe combination of crystalline phases, taking the entire profile into account.\nThis method estimates the Bayesian posterior probability of crystalline phase\ncombinations by performing an approximate exhaustive search of all possible\ncombinations.

From the timing analysis, we found that\nthe source exhibited variability of $\\sim$20 % during the 2007 observation,\nwhich reduced to below 10 % in the subsequent observations and became\nnon-variable in the observations from 2010 onward. From the spectral study, we\nfound that the spectra are nearly featureless. Non-detection of absorption in\nthe low-energy domain during the 15 years of observation infers the absence of\nobscuration around the central engine, rendering the nucleus a `bare' type. A\nprominent soft X-ray excess below 2 keV was detected in the source spectrum\nduring the observations between 2007 and 2010, which vanished during the later\nobservations. To describe the nature of the soft excess, we use two physical\nmodels, such as warm Comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized\naccretion disk. Both the physical models explain the nature and origin of the\nsoft excess in this source.

Using numerical simulations and an\nassociated mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the temporal structure of the\nSTDP rule, specifically its degree of causality, critically determines whether\nassemblies that share neurons maintain segregation or merge together after\ntraining is completed. We find that causal STDP rules, where\npotentiation/depression occurs strictly when presynaptic spikes precede/proceed\npostsynaptic spikes, allow assemblies to remain distinct even with substantial\noverlap in membership. This stability arises because causal STDP effectively\ncancels the symmetric correlations introduced by common inputs from shared\nneurons. In contrast, acausal STDP rules lead to assembly fusion when overlap\nexceeds a critical threshold, due to unchecked growth of common input\ncorrelations. Our results provide theoretical insight into how\nspike-timing-dependent learning rules can support distributed representation\nwhere individual neurons participate in multiple assemblies while maintaining\nfunctional specificity.",

While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a\npromising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified\ndatabases. Herein, we use constant-potential molecular simulation to construct\na unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal-organic framework\n(MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well-trained decision-tree-based ML\nmodels achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and\ncharging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case.

To address this gap, we propose SEAL (SEcure wAtermarking on\nLoRA weights), the universal whitebox watermarking for LoRA. SEAL embeds a\nsecret, non-trainable matrix between trainable LoRA weights, serving as a\npassport to claim ownership. SEAL then entangles the passport with the LoRA\nweights through training, without extra loss for entanglement, and distributes\nthe finetuned weights after hiding the passport. When applying SEAL, we\nobserved no performance degradation across commonsense reasoning,\ntextual/visual instruction tuning, and text-to-image synthesis tasks. We\ndemonstrate that SEAL is robust against a variety of known attacks: removal,\nobfuscation, and ambiguity attacks.",

The method offers multiple input types for learning objectives,\nallowing users to specify both boundaries and layouts. It incorporates natural\nlanguage as design constraints and introduces ControlNet to enable stable\nlayout generation through two distinct pathways.

This comprehensibility and diversity of input options enable\nprofessionals and non-professionals to directly express design requirements,\nenhancing flexibility and controllability.

However, in zero-shot 3D classification, collecting 3D data and\ncaptions is costly and laborintensive, posing a significant barrier compared to\n2D vision. Recent advances in generative models have achieved unprecedented\nrealism in synthetic data production, and recent research shows the potential\nfor using generated data as training data. Here, naturally raising the\nquestion: Can synthetic 3D data generated by generative models be used as\nexpanding limited 3D datasets? In response, we present a synthetic 3D dataset\nexpansion method, Textguided Geometric Augmentation (TeGA). TeGA is tailored\nfor language-image-3D pretraining, which achieves SoTA in zero-shot 3D\nclassification, and uses a generative textto-3D model to enhance and extend\nlimited 3D datasets. Specifically, we automatically generate text-guided\nsynthetic 3D data and introduce a consistency filtering strategy to discard\nnoisy samples where semantics and geometric shapes do not match with text. In\nthe experiment to double the original dataset size using TeGA, our approach\ndemonstrates improvements over the baselines, achieving zeroshot performance\ngains of 3.0% on Objaverse-LVIS, 4.6% on ScanObjectNN, and 8.7% on ModelNet40.\nThese results demonstrate that TeGA effectively bridges the 3D data gap,\nenabling robust zero-shot 3D classification even with limited real training\ndata and paving the way for zero-shot 3D vision application.",

At the core of our approach is the\nobservation that INRs can be considered as a learnable dictionary, with the\nshapes of the basis functions governed by the weights of the INR, and their\nlocations governed by the biases. Given compact non-linear activation\nfunctions, we hypothesize that an INR's biases are suitable to capture motion\nacross images, and facilitate compact representations for video sequences.\nUsing these observations, we design ActINR to share INR weights across frames\nof a video sequence, while using unique biases for each frame. We further model\nthe biases as the output of a separate INR conditioned on time index to promote\nsmoothness. By training the video INR and this bias INR together, we\ndemonstrate unique capabilities, including $10\\times$ video slow motion, 4x\nspatial super resolution along with 2x slow motion, denoising, and video\ninpainting. ActINR performs remarkably well across numerous video processing\ntasks (often achieving more than 6dB improvement), setting a new standard for\ncontinuous modeling of videos.",

However, traditional lens-based designs impose minimum thickness\nconstraints on these sensors, limiting their applicability in space-restricted\nsettings. In this paper, we propose ThinTact, a novel lensless vision-based\ntactile sensor with a sensing field of over 200 mm2 and a thickness of less\nthan 10 mm.ThinTact utilizes the mask-based lensless imaging technique to map\nthe contact information to CMOS signals. To ensure real-time tactile sensing,\nwe propose a real-time lensless reconstruction algorithm that leverages a\nfrequency-spatial-domain joint filter based on discrete cosine transform (DCT).\nThis algorithm achieves computation significantly faster than existing\noptimization-based methods. Additionally, to improve the sensing quality, we\ndevelop a mask optimization method based on the generic algorithm and the\ncorresponding system matrix calibration algorithm.We evaluate the performance\nof our proposed lensless reconstruction and tactile sensing through qualitative\nand quantitative experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate ThinTact's practical\napplicability in diverse applications, including texture recognition and\ncontact-rich object manipulation.

However, this result does not extend to models of tree\nshape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary\nbiology.

Both exact and asymptotic results are\npresented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a\nrandom number of tip species are sampled.",

SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture\nwith two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and\nImage Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student\nencoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided\nby a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B\nto reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor.\nThese strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images\nsimultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models.\nExperimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD\nachieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\\%, while\nmaintaining strong image restoration performance.",

Different\nfrom objective tasks such as commonsense reasoning and arithmetic\nquestion-answering, the performance of LLMs on subjective tasks is still\nlimited, where the perspective on the specific problem plays crucial roles for\nbetter interpreting the context and giving proper response. For example, in\ncertain scenarios, LLMs may perform better when answering from an expert role\nperspective, potentially eliciting their relevant domain knowledge. In\ncontrast, in some scenarios, LLMs may provide more accurate responses when\nanswering from a third-person standpoint, enabling a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the problem and potentially mitigating inherent biases. In\nthis paper, we propose Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method\nbased on in-context learning that enables LLMs to dynamically select among\ndirect, role, and third-person perspectives for the best way to solve\ncorresponding subjective problem. Through extensive experiments on totally 12\nsubjective tasks by using both closed-source and open-source LLMs including\nGPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and Qwen-2, our method outperforms widely used single\nfixed perspective based methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and expert\nprompting, highlights the intricate ways that LLMs can adapt their perspectives\nto provide nuanced and contextually appropriate responses for different\nproblems.",

We examine more closely the\noperational definition of a measurement device, discussing the Unruh-DeWitt and\nGlauber models of quantum detectors. The transition probability per unit of\nproper time of both detectors in different non-inertial frames of reference in\nMinkowski spacetime is evaluated. We first study detectors traveling in a\nstationary worldline with a constant proper acceleration, i.e., a hyperbolic\nmotion, interacting with the field prepared in the Poincar\\'e invariant Fock\nvacuum state. Next, we study the Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest in a\nnon-uniformly accelerated frame, with a time dependent acceleration interacting\nwith the field in the Poincar\\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. We evaluate the\npositive frequency Wightman function for the non-uniformly accelerated frame in\na finite time interval and find that it is similar to the two-point correlation\nfunction of a system in equilibrium with a thermal bath. Calculating the\ntransition rate, the non-uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector can be\nexcited even if the scalar field is prepared in the vacuum state.",

    "abstract": "This chapter starts with a discussion of the main qualitative differences\nbetween UV and mid-IR filaments: from multiphoton ionization in the UV to\ntunnel ionization in the near- to mid-IR. A general qualitative analysis of the\nproperties of single filaments versus wavelength follows. Because of their long\npulse duration, a quasi-steady-state theory of their propagation is possible.\nAn eigenvalue approach leads to a steady-state field envelope that is compared\nto the Townes soliton. However, that solution is close enough to a Gaussian\nshape to justify a parametric evolution approach. After this theoretical\nintroduction, an experimental verification at 266 nm follows. Femtosecond UV\nfilaments were generated with frequency-tripled Ti:sapphire sources and KrF\namplifiers. The source for long-pulse filaments is an oscillator-amplifier\nNd-YAG Q-switched system, frequency doubled, compressed, and frequency doubled\nagain to reach 170 ps pulses of 300 mJ energy. The sub-nanosecond duration of\nthe UV pulse may revive the debate as whether the filament is a moving focus or\nself-induced waveguide. Two applications of UV filaments are presented in the\nlast two sections. It is shown that isotopically selective laser-induced\nbreakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is possible by exploiting the narrow dips\nobserved in the emission spectrum. These dips are due to reabsorption by the\nmaterial in the plume created by the impact of the filament on a solid. These\nabsorption lines are only a few-pm wide and are exactly centered at the\nwavelength of a transition from ground state of the material, without any Stark\nshift or broadening. A final application is laser-induced discharge, which is a\nguided discharge that follows exactly the path of the inducing UV filament.\nLaser-induced discharge may lead to the control of lightning, which is a topic\nof intense research in Europe.",

Although\nshallow fusion is the most common approach to incorporate language models into\nE2E-ASR decoding, we face two practical problems with LLMs. (1) LLM inference\nis computationally costly. (2) There may be a vocabulary mismatch between the\nASR model and the LLM. To resolve this mismatch, we need to retrain the ASR\nmodel and/or the LLM, which is at best time-consuming and in many cases not\nfeasible. We propose \"delayed fusion,\" which applies LLM scores to ASR\nhypotheses with a delay during decoding and enables easier use of pre-trained\nLLMs in ASR tasks. This method can reduce not only the number of hypotheses\nscored by the LLM but also the number of LLM inference calls. It also allows\nre-tokenizion of ASR hypotheses during decoding if ASR and LLM employ different\ntokenizations.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have great potential in urban traffic\nmonitoring due to their rapid speed, cost-effectiveness, and extensive\nfield-of-view, while being unconstrained by traffic congestion. However, their\nlimited flight duration presents critical challenges in sustainable recharging\nstrategies and efficient route planning in long-term monitoring tasks.\nAdditionally, existing approaches for long-term monitoring often neglect the\nevolving nature of urban traffic networks. In this study, we introduce a novel\ndynamic UAV routing framework for long-term, network-wide urban traffic\nmonitoring, leveraging existing ground vehicles as mobile charging stations\nwithout disrupting their operations. To address the complexity of long-term\nmonitoring scenarios involving multiple flights, we decompose the problem into\nmanageable single-flight tasks, in which each flight is modeled as a Team Arc\nOrienteering Problem with Decreasing Profits with the objective to collectively\nmaximize the spatiotemporal network coverage. Between flights, we adaptively\nupdate the edge weights to incorporate real-time traffic changes and revisit\nintervals. We validate our framework through extensive microscopic simulations\nin a modified Sioux Falls network under various scenarios. Comparative results\ndemonstrate that our model outperforms three baseline approaches, especially\nwhen historical information is incomplete or absent. Moreover, we show that our\nmonitoring framework can capture network-wide traffic trends and construct\naccurate Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs). These findings demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed dynamic UAV routing framework, underscoring\nits suitability for efficient and reliable long-term traffic monitoring. Our\napproach's adaptability and high accuracy in capturing the MFD highlight its\npotential in network-wide traffic control and management applications.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration pulses occurring at\ncosmological distances with a mysterious origin. Observations show that at\nleast some FRBs are produced by magnetars. All magnetar-powered FRB models\nrequire some triggering mechanisms, among which the most popular is the crust\ncracking of a neutron star, which is called starquake. However, so far there\nhas been no decisive evidence for this speculation. Here we report the energy\nfunctions of the three most active repeating FRBs, which show a universal break\naround $10^{38}$ erg. Such a break is similar to that of the\nfrequency-magnitude relationship of earthquakes. The break and change of the\npower-law indices below and above it can be well understood within the\nframework of FRBs triggered by starquakes in the magnetar models. The seed of\nweak FRBs can grow both on the magnetar surface and in the deeper crust. In\ncontrast, the triggering of strong FRBs is confined by the crustal thickness\nand the seed of strong FRBs can only grow on the surface. This difference in\ndimensionality causes a break in the scaling properties from weak to strong\nFRBs, occurring at a point where the penetration depth of starquakes equals the\ncrustal thickness. Our result, together with the earthquake-like temporal\nproperties of these FRBs, strongly supports that FRBs are triggered by\nstarquakes, providing a new opportunity to study the physical properties of the\nneutron star crust.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message\nAuthentication (OSNMA) and, for the first time, discovers two critical\nvulnerabilities, namely artificially-manipulated time synchronization (ATS) and\ninterruptible message authentication (IMA). ATS allows attackers falsify a\nreceiver's signals and/or local reference time (LRT) while still fulfilling the\ntime synchronization (TS) requirement. IMA allows temporary interruption of the\nnavigation data authentication process due to the reception of a broken message\n(probably caused by spoofing attacks) and restores the authentication later. By\nexploiting the ATS vulnerability, we propose a TS-comply replay (TSR) attack\nwith two variants (real-time and non-real-time), where attackers replay signals\nto a victim receiver while strictly complying with the TS rule. We further\npropose a TS-comply forgery (TSF) attack, where attackers first use a\npreviously-disclosed key to forge a message based on the OSNMA protocol, then\ntamper with the vitcim receiver's LRT correspondingly to comply with the TS\nrule and finally transmit the forged message to the receiver. Finally, we\npropose a concatenating replay (CR) attack based on the IMA vulnerability,\nwhere attackers concatenate replayed signals to the victim receiver's signals\nin a way that still enables correct verification of the navigation data in the\nreplayed signals. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks, we\nconduct real-world experiments with a commercial Galileo receiver manufactured\nby Septentrio, two software-defined radio (SDR) devices, open-source\nGalileo-SDR-SIM and OSNMAlib software. The results showed that all the attacks\ncan successfully pass the OSNMA scheme and the TSF attack can spoof receivers\nto arbitrary locations.",

Due to substantial parameters, fine-tuning LLMs on\nmobile devices demands considerable memory resources, and suffers from high\ncommunication overhead and long fine-tuning delay. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient LLM fine-tuning scheme in wireless networks, named Split Fine-Tuning\n(SFT), which can accommodate LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices. Specifically,\nan LLM is split into a server-side part on the edge server and a device-side\npart on the mobile device to satisfy the device-side memory constraint. All\ndevices share a server-side model and perform parallel fine-tuning to reduce\nfine-tuning delay. In addition, to reduce significant communication overhead\nincurred by data exchange between devices and the edge server, we propose a\ndata compression scheme by jointly leveraging sparsification, stochastic\nquantization, and lossless encoding methods. Furthermore, we formulate a\nfine-tuning delay minimization problem under accuracy and memory constraints,\ntaking device heterogeneity and channel dynamics into account. To solve the\nproblem, the nonlinear mixed-integer problem is decoupled into two subproblems\nin different timescales. The two-timescale resource management algorithm is\nproposed to jointly optimize the compression rate and transformer block\nallocation in the large timescale using the augmented Lagrangian method, and\ndetermine spectrum resource allocation in the small timescale via sequential\nquadratic programming. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme can reduce the fine-tuning delay by up to 80.2% and\ncommunication overhead by 93.6% compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, while\nsatisfying device-side memory and model accuracy constraints.",

    "abstract": "The HyperText Markup Language 5 (HTML5) <canvas> is useful for creating\nvisual-centric web applications. However, unlike traditional web applications,\nHTML5 <canvas> applications render objects onto the <canvas> bitmap without\nrepresenting them in the Document Object Model (DOM). Mismatches between the\nexpected and actual visual output of the <canvas> bitmap are termed visual\nbugs. Due to the visual-centric nature of <canvas> applications, visual bugs\nare important to detect because such bugs can render a <canvas> application\nuseless. As we showed in prior work, Asset-Based graphics can provide the\nground truth for a visual test oracle. However, many <canvas> applications\nprocedurally generate their graphics. In this paper, we investigate how to\ndetect visual bugs in <canvas> applications that use Procedural graphics as\nwell. In particular, we explore the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nto automatically detect visual bugs. Instead of defining an exact visual test\noracle, information about the application's expected functionality (the\ncontext) can be provided with the screenshot as input to the VLM. To evaluate\nthis approach, we constructed a dataset containing 80 bug-injected screenshots\nacross four visual bug types (Layout, Rendering, Appearance, and State) plus 20\nbug-free screenshots from 20 <canvas> applications. We ran experiments with a\nstate-of-the-art VLM using several combinations of text and image context to\ndescribe each application's expected functionality. Our results show that by\nproviding the application README(s), a description of visual bug types, and a\nbug-free screenshot as context, VLMs can be leveraged to detect visual bugs\nwith up to 100% per-application accuracy.",

Twitch users can give gift\nsubscriptions to other viewers in the chat room, with the majority of gifters\nopting for community gifting, which is gifting to randomly selected viewers. We\nidentify the random nature of gift-receiving in our data as a natural\nexperiment setting. We investigate whether gift recipients pay it forward,\nconsidering various gift types that may either promote or deter the spread of\ngifting. Our findings reveal that Twitch viewers who receive gift subscriptions\nare generally more likely to pay it forward than non-recipients, and the\npositive impact of gift-receiving becomes stronger when the recipient is the\nsole beneficiary of the giver's gifting behavior. However, we found that gifts\nfrom frequent gifters discourage recipients from paying it forward, and gifts\nfrom anonymous gifters do not influence the likelihood of viewers becoming\nfuture gifters. This research contributes to the existing literature on the\nspread of online prosocial behavior by providing robust evidence and suggests\npractical strategies for promoting online gifting.",

Meanwhile, recent\nresearches have indicated that sparse arrays may offer promising advantages for\nXL-MIMO systems in the near-field. Motivated by these, this paper investigates\na downlink near-field XL-MIMO communication system with sparse uniform planar\narrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper\nfocuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point\nof the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the\nx-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power\ndistributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length\nof the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the\nantenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial\nconstraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom\n(EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then,\nthe paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can\nestimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity.

    "abstract": "Affordances, a foundational concept in human-computer interaction and design,\nhave traditionally been explained by direct-perception theories, which assume\nthat individuals perceive action possibilities directly from the environment.\nHowever, these theories fall short of explaining how affordances are perceived,\nlearned, refined, or misperceived, and how users choose between multiple\naffordances in dynamic contexts. This paper introduces a novel affordance\ntheory grounded in Computational Rationality, positing that humans construct\ninternal representations of the world based on bounded sensory inputs. Within\nthese internal models, affordances are inferred through two core mechanisms:\nfeature recognition and hypothetical motion trajectories. Our theory redefines\naffordance perception as a decision-making process, driven by two components:\nconfidence (the perceived likelihood of successfully executing an action) and\npredicted utility (the expected value of the outcome). By balancing these\nfactors, individuals make informed decisions about which actions to take. Our\ntheory frames affordances perception as dynamic, continuously learned, and\nrefined through reinforcement and feedback. We validate the theory via thought\nexperiments and demonstrate its applicability across diverse types of\naffordances (e.g., physical, digital, social). Beyond clarifying and\ngeneralizing the understanding of affordances across contexts, our theory\nserves as a foundation for improving design communication and guiding the\ndevelopment of more adaptive and intuitive systems that evolve with user\ncapabilities.",

These\nproperties are then applied to elastic models to predict assembly outcomes,\nwhich align well with experimental observations. This approach not only\nprovides a deeper understanding of nanoparticle mechanics, but also opens new\npathways to refining subunit designs to achieve precise assembly behavior.

To alleviate this issue for ViTs, in\nthis paper, we propose ASCENT-ViT, an attention-based, concept learning\nframework that effectively composes scale and position-aware representations\nfrom multiscale feature pyramids and ViT patch representations, respectively.\nFurther, these representations are aligned with concept annotations through\nattention matrices - which incorporate spatial and global (semantic) concepts.\nASCENT-ViT can be utilized as a classification head on top of standard ViT\nbackbones for improved predictive performance and accurate and robust concept\nexplanations as demonstrated on five datasets, including three widely used\nbenchmarks (CUB, Pascal APY, Concept-MNIST) and 2 real-world datasets (AWA2,\nKITS).",

This peculiar spectral shape represents a golden opportunity\nto test whether the standard framework commonly adopted for modelling local AGN\nis still valid. We thus present the results on the joint XMM-Newton and HST\nmonitoring campaign of the highly accreting US-NLSy RBS 1332. The optical-to-UV\nspectrum of RBS 1332 exhibits evidence of both a stratified narrow-line region\nand an ionized outflow, that produces absorption troughs over a wide range of\nvelocities (from ~1500 km s-1 to ~1700 km s-1) in several high-ionization\ntransitions (Lyalpha, N V, C IV). From a spectroscopic point of view, the\noptical/UV/FUV/X-rays emission of this source is due to the superposition of\nthree distinct components which are best modelled in the context of the\ntwo-coronae framework in which the radiation of RBS 1332 can be ascribed to a\nstandard outer disk, a warm Comptonization region and a soft coronal continuum.\nThe present dataset is not compatible with a pure relativistic reflection\nscenario. Finally, the adoption of the novel model reXcor allowed us to\ndetermine that the soft X-ray excess in RBS 1332 is dominated by the emission\nof the optically thick and warm Comptonizing medium, and only marginal\ncontribution is expected from relativistic reflection from a lamppost-like\ncorona.",

Full Disjunction, which is an associative extension of\nthe outer join operator, has been shown to be an effective operator for\nintegrating datasets. It fully preserves and combines the available\ninformation. Existing Full Disjunction algorithms only consider the equi-join\nscenario where only tuples having the same value on joining columns are\nintegrated. This, however, does not realistically represent an open data\nscenario, where datasets come from diverse sources with inconsistent values\n(e.g., synonyms, abbreviations, etc.) and with limited metadata. So, joining\njust on equal values severely limits the ability of Full Disjunction to fully\ncombine datasets. Thus, in this work, we propose an extension of Full\nDisjunction to also account for \"fuzzy\" matches among tuples. We present a\nnovel data-driven approach to enable the joining of approximate or fuzzy\nmatches within Full Disjunction.
