    "abstract": "This paper explores the observability and estimation capability of dynamical\nsystems using predominantly relative measurements of the system's state-space\nvariables, with minimal to no reliance on absolute measurements of these\nvariables. We concentrate on linear time-invariant systems, in which the\nobservation matrix serves as the algebraic representation of a graph object.\nThis graph object encapsulates the availability of relative measurements.\nUtilizing algebraic graph theory and abstract linear algebra (geometric) tools,\nwe establish a link between the structure of the graph of relative measurements\nand the system-theoretic observability subspace of linear systems. Special\nemphasis is given to multi-agent networked systems whose dynamics are governed\nby the linear consensus protocol. We demonstrate the importance of absolute\ninformation and its placement to the system's dynamics in achieving full-state\nestimation. Finally, the analysis shifts to the synthesis of a distributed\nobserver with relative measurements for single integrator dynamics,\nexemplifying the relevance of the preceding analytical findings. We support our\ntheoretical analysis with numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "This research tests the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as formal second\nopinion tools in professional decision-making, particularly focusing on complex\nmedical cases where even experienced physicians seek peer consultation. The\nwork analyzed 183 challenging medical cases from Medscape over a 20-month\nperiod, testing multiple LLMs' performance against crowd-sourced physician\nresponses. A key finding was the high overall score possible in the latest\nfoundational models (>80% accuracy compared to consensus opinion), which\nexceeds most human metrics reported on the same clinical cases (450 pages of\npatient profiles, test results). The study rates the LLMs' performance\ndisparity between straightforward cases (>81% accuracy) and complex scenarios\n(43% accuracy), particularly in these cases generating substantial debate among\nhuman physicians. The research demonstrates that LLMs may be valuable as\ngenerators of comprehensive differential diagnoses rather than as primary\ndiagnostic tools, potentially helping to counter cognitive biases in clinical\ndecision-making, reduce cognitive loads, and thus remove some sources of\nmedical error. The inclusion of a second comparative legal dataset (Supreme\nCourt cases, N=21) provides added empirical context to the AI use to foster\nsecond opinions, though these legal challenges proved considerably easier for\nLLMs to analyze. In addition to the original contributions of empirical\nevidence for LLM accuracy, the research aggregated a novel benchmark for others\nto score highly contested question and answer reliability between both LLMs and\ndisagreeing human practitioners. These results suggest that the optimal\ndeployment of LLMs in professional settings may differ substantially from\ncurrent approaches that emphasize automation of routine tasks.",

Stars born together, sharing a\ncommon origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to\nstudy these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the\ndistinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only\ndiscernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance\nmeasurements for 125 co-moving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample\nto date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium\nabundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet\nengulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar\nparameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is\ntypically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and\ncooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet\nengulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter,\nour findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator\nfor planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to\nplanet engulfment events.",

Extensive\nexperiments on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, evaluated against over seven\nOOD datasets, demonstrate that PViT significantly outperforms existing SOTA OOD\ndetection methods in terms of FPR95 and AUROC.

In the {\\sc Partial Grundy Coloring}, the task is also\nto color the graph using as many colors as possible. This time, however, we may\nselect both the ordering in which the vertices are considered and which color\nto assign the vertex. The only constraint is that the color assigned to a\nvertex $v$ is a color previously used for another vertex if such a color is\navailable.\n  Whether {\\sc Grundy Coloring} and {\\sc Partial Grundy Coloring} admit\nfixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms, algorithms with running time\n$f(k)n^{\\OO(1)}$, where $k$ is the number of colors, was posed as an open\nproblem by Zaker and by Effantin et al., respectively.

However, while inflation of\ndeveloping low-income countries is hardly affected by international conditions,\nthe results for middle-income countries are mixed.

Such\ntemporal dynamics are critical in representations learning, especially for\npredicting dynamic networks behaviors. To this end, a Deep Hawkes Process based\nDynamic Networks Representation algorithm (DHPrep) is proposed in this paper,\nwhich is capable of capturing temporal dynamics of dynamic networks.\nSpecifically, DHPrep incorporates both structural information and temporal\ndynamics to learn vertices representations that can model the edge formation\nprocess for a vertex pair, where the structural information is used to capture\nthe historical impact from their neighborhood, and the temporal dynamics\nutilize this historical information and apply Hawkes point process to model the\nedges formation process. Moreover, a temporal smoother is further imposed to\nensure the representations evolve smoothly over time.

Motivated by recent advances in\nmachine learning, particularly in generative modeling and sampling, we present\na rigorous investigation of Fisher-Rao and Wasserstein type gradient flows\nconcerning their gradient structures, flow equations, and their kernel\napproximations. Specifically, we focus on the Fisher-Rao (also known as\nHellinger) geometry and its various kernel-based approximations, developing a\nprincipled theoretical framework using tools from PDE gradient flows and\noptimal transport theory. We also provide a complete characterization of\ngradient flows in the maximum-mean discrepancy (MMD) space, with connections to\nexisting learning and inference algorithms. Our analysis reveals precise\ntheoretical insights linking Fisher-Rao flows, Stein flows, kernel\ndiscrepancies, and nonparametric regression. We then rigorously prove\nevolutionary $\\Gamma$-convergence for kernel-approximated Fisher-Rao flows,\nproviding theoretical guarantees beyond pointwise convergence. Finally, we\nanalyze energy dissipation using the Helmholtz-Rayleigh principle, establishing\nimportant connections between classical theory in mechanics and modern machine\nlearning practice.

This study is motivated by accelerometry data collected on 246\nindividuals with multiple sclerosis (MS)representing a wide range of disability\n(Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS: 0-7). We consider five different\nindividual-level distributional representations of minute-level activity\ncounts: density, survival, hazard, quantile, and total time on test functions.\nFor each of the five distributional representations, scalar-on-function\nregression fits linear discriminators for binary and continuously measured MS\ndisability, and cross-validated discriminatory performance of these linear\ndiscriminators is compared across. The results show that individual-level\nhazard functions provide the highest discriminatory accuracy, more than double\nthe accuracy compared to density functions.

    "abstract": "We consider a class of learning problem of point estimation for modeling\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear functions, whose learning dynamics is guided by\nmodel training dataset, while the estimated parameter in due course provides an\nacceptable prediction accuracy on a different model validation dataset. Here,\nwe establish an evidential connection between such a learning problem and a\nhierarchical optimal control problem that provides a framework how to account\nappropriately for both generalization and regularization at the optimization\nstage. In particular, we consider the following two objectives: (i) The first\none is a controllability-type problem, i.e., generalization, which consists of\nguaranteeing the estimated parameter to reach a certain target set at some\nfixed final time, where such a target set is associated with model validation\ndataset. (ii) The second one is a regularization-type problem ensuring the\nestimated parameter trajectory to satisfy some regularization property over a\ncertain finite time interval. First, we partition the control into two control\nstrategies that are compatible with two abstract agents, namely, a leader,\nwhich is responsible for the controllability-type problem and that of a\nfollower, which is associated with the regularization-type problem. Using the\nnotion of Stackelberg's optimization, we provide conditions on the existence of\nadmissible optimal controls for such a hierarchical optimal control problem\nunder which the follower is required to respond optimally to the strategy of\nthe leader, so as to achieve the overall objectives that ultimately leading to\nan optimal parameter estimate. Moreover, we provide a nested algorithm,\narranged in a hierarchical structure-based on successive approximation methods,\nfor solving the corresponding optimal control problem.

By tightly\nfocusing circularly polarized Gaussian beams through a high numerical aperture\nobjective into a refractive index stratified medium, we create a spherically\naberrated intensity profile where the spinning motion of a micromotor optically\ntrapped at the centre of the profile induces fluid flows that causes orbiting\nmotion of the off-axially trapped surrounding particles (secondary\nmicromotors). In addition, the interaction between the helicity of light and\nthe anisotropic properties of the LC medium leads to the breaking of the input\nhelicity and drives the conversion of right to left-circular polarization and\nvice-versa. This spin-to-spin conversion, causes the orbiting secondary\nmicromotors to spin in certain cases as well so that the entire system of\nspinning primary micromotor and revolving and spinning secondary micromotors is\nreminiscent of planetary motion at mesoscopic scales.

    "abstract": "The bright radio source, GLEAM J091734-001243 (hereafter GLEAM J0917-0012),\nwas previously selected as a candidate ultra-high redshift (z>5) radio galaxy\ndue to its compact radio size and faint magnitude (K(AB)=22.7). Its redshift\nwas not conclusively determined from follow-up millimetre and near-infrared\nspectroscopy. Here we present new HST WFC3 G141 grism observations which reveal\nseveral emission lines including [NeIII]3867, [NeV]3426 and an extended (~4.8\nkpc), [OII]3727 line which confirm a redshift of 3.004+/-0.001. The extended\ncomponent of the [OII]3727 line is co-spatial with one of two components seen\nat 2.276 GHz in high resolution (60x20 mas) Long Baseline Array data,\nreminiscent of the alignments seen in local compact radio galaxies. The BEAGLE\nstellar mass (~2x10^11 Msun) and radio luminosity (L_500MHz}~10^28 W Hz^-1) put\nGLEAM J0917-0012 within the distribution of the brightest high-redshift radio\ngalaxies at similar redshifts. However, it is more compact than all of them.\nModelling of the radio jet demonstrates that this is a young, ~50 kyr old, but\npowerful, 10^39 W, compact steep spectrum radio source. The weak constraint on\nthe active galactic nucleus bolometric luminosity from the [NeV]3426 line\ncombined with the modelled jet power tentatively implies a large black hole\nmass, >10^9 Msun, and a low, advection-dominated accretion rate, an Eddington\nratio <0.03. The [NeV]3426/[NeIII]3867 vs [OII]3727/[NeIII]3867 line ratios are\nmost easily explained by radiative shock models with precursor photoionisation.\nHence, we infer that the line emission is directly caused by the shocks from\nthe jet and that this radio source is one of the youngest and most powerful\nknown at cosmic noon. We speculate that the star-formation in GLEAM J0917-0012\ncould be on its way to becoming quenched by the jet.",

    "abstract": "Lie symmetry transformations that leave a differential equation invariant\nplay a fundamental role in science and mathematics. Such Lie symmetry groups\nuniquely determine their Lie symmetry algebras. Exact differential elimination\nalgorithms have been developed to determine the dimension and structure\nconstants of the Lie symmetry algebra of an exact polynomially nonlinear\ndifferential equation. Directly applying these symbolic algorithms to\napproximate models is prone to instability since these algorithms strongly\ndepend on the orderings of the variables involved. This motivates the need to\naddress questions at the algorithmic foundation of approximate Lie symmetry\nalgebras of differential equations. How do we define approximate Lie symmetry?\nHow do we compute and apply approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential\nequations? How reliable are the results?\n  To address such questions, we define approximate Lie symmetry algebras in\nterms of exact Lie symmetry algebras of a nearby differential equation. Our\nalgorithm for identifying these hidden approximate Lie symmetry algebras uses\nthe SVD to find nearby rank-deficient systems combined with approximate\ngeometric involutive forms of the approximate symmetry-defining systems. Our\napproach is local and depends on an input base point in the space of\nindependent and dependent variables. In general, our local approach can yield\nmany different nearby Lie symmetry algebras. We also outline a numerical\napproach to determining the approximate isomorphic of such Lie symmetry\nalgebras as the local base point varies across a grid in the base space. We\nalso provide a method for evaluating the reliability of our results. This\nenables the base space to be partitioned into regions where different local Lie\nsymmetry algebras are admitted, separated by unstable transition regions.",

A powerful tool for modeling such\nsetups is the Generalized Langevin Equation, however, its analysis typically\nposes a major challenge even for numerical means. For this reason, various\napproximations have been proposed over the years that simplify the original\nmodel. In this work we compare two methods allowing to tackle this great\nchallenge: (i) the well-known and successful Markovian embedding technique and\n(ii) the recently developed effective mass approach. We discuss their scope of\napplicability, numerical accuracy, and computational efficiency. In doing so we\nconsider a paradigmatic model of a free Brownian particle subjected to\npower-law correlated thermal noise. We show that when the memory time is short,\nthe effective mass approach offers satisfying precision and typically is much\nfaster than the Markovian embedding. Moreover, the concept of effective mass\ncan be used to find optimal parameters allowing to reach supreme accuracy and\nminimal computational cost within the embedding.

We employ 3D filament and\nCME shock reconstructions using data from SolO, STEREO-A, and SDO to track the\nfilament's path, height, and kinematics. Our analysis across three viewpoints\nshows the outer front in SolO/EUI 304 \\r{A} aligns with shock structures in\nSTEREO-A/EUVI 195 \\r{A}, showing a full 3D EUV wave dome, later matching the\nouter CME front in STEREO-A COR2. We introduce the method ATLAS-3D (Advanced\nTechnique for single Line-of-sight Acquisition of Structures in 3D) and\nvalidate it against traditional approaches to reconstruct CME shock using SOLO\ndata exclusively. Additionally, we estimate early CME propagation\ncharacteristics based on coronal dimming evolution with the DIRECD method.\nResults indicate that the filament height increased from 28 to 616 Mm (0.04 to\n0.89 Rs) within 30 minutes (11:05 to 11:35 UT), reaching peak velocity of\naround 648 km/s and acceleration of around 1624 m/s$^2$.

Key\nparameters include a CME direction inclined by 6{\\deg}, a 21{\\deg} half-width,\nand a 1.12 Rs cone height at the dimming's impulsive phase end.

    "abstract": "In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential\nfor understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts.\nTraditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and\nlabor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle\ndetection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station\ninformation and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to\nperform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to\nreal-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This\nstudy introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to\nautomate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward\ntransformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling\ntheir use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design\nthat integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing,\nperforming both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic\nevent classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet,\nUNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events\nrecorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\\'an Volcanic\nComplex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\\'on Caulle. Among these\nmodels, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model,\nachieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and\n0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model\nflexibility to unseen volcano datasets.",

Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled\nhigh-fidelity novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. However, the noisy and\ndiscrete nature of 3D Gaussian primitives hinders accurate surface estimation.\nPrevious attempts to regularize 3D Gaussian normals often degrade rendering\nquality due to the fundamental disconnect between normal vectors and the\nrendering pipeline in 3DGS-based methods. Therefore, we introduce Normal-GS, a\nnovel approach that integrates normal vectors into the 3DGS rendering pipeline.\nThe core idea is to model the interaction between normals and incident lighting\nusing the physically-based rendering equation. Our approach re-parameterizes\nsurface colors as the product of normals and a designed Integrated Directional\nIllumination Vector (IDIV). To optimize memory usage and simplify optimization,\nwe employ an anchor-based 3DGS to implicitly encode locally-shared IDIVs.\nAdditionally, Normal-GS leverages optimized normals and Integrated Directional\nEncoding (IDE) to accurately model specular effects, enhancing both rendering\nquality and surface normal precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nNormal-GS achieves near state-of-the-art visual quality while obtaining\naccurate surface normals and preserving real-time rendering performance.",

But producing full-physics hydrodynamical simulations of the most\nmassive clusters is not an easy task.

    "abstract": "The interfacial instability in a two-phase mixing layers between parallel gas\nand liquid streams is important to two-phase atomization. Depending on the\ninflow conditions and fluid properties, interfacial instability can be\nconvective or absolute. The goal of the present study is to investigate the\nimpact of gas viscosity on the interfacial instability. Both interface-resolved\nsimulations and linear stability analysis (LSA) have been conducted. In LSA,\nthe Orr-Sommerfeld equation is solved to analyze the spatio-temporal viscous\nmodes. When the gas viscosity decreases, the Reynold number ($\\text{Re}$)\nincreases accordingly. The LSA demonstrates that when $\\text{Re}$ is higher\nthan a critical threshold, the instability transitions from the absolute to the\nconvective (A/C) regimes. Such a $\\text{Re}$-induced A/C transition is also\nobserved in the numerical simulations, though the critical Re observed in\nsimulations is significantly lower than that predicted by LSA. The LSA results\nindicate that the temporal growth rate decreases with Re. When the growth rate\nreaches zero, the A/C transition will occur. The $\\text{Re}$-induced A/C\ntransition is observed in both confined and unconfined mixing layers and also\nin cases with low and high gas-to-liquid density ratios. In the transition from\ntypical absolute and convective regimes, a weak absolute regime is identified\nin the simulations, for which \\tcr{the spectrograms} show both the absolute and\nconvective modes. The dominant frequency in the weak absolute regime can be\ninfluenced by the perturbation introduced at the inlet. The simulation results\nalso show that the wave propagation speed can vary in space. In the absolute\ninstability regime, the wave propagation speed agrees well with the absolute\nmode celerity near the inlet and increases to the Dimotakis speed further\ndownstream.",

It is observed that the resulting asymmetric vaporization rates\nand strengths of Stefan flow on the windward and leeward sides of the drop\nhinder bag development and prevent drop breakup.

As bars are non-axisymmetric\nstructures, stronger bars are expected to show stronger non-circular motions.\nHowever, this has not yet been confirmed by observations. We use a bisymmetric\nmodel to account for the stellar kinematics of 14 barred galaxies obtained with\nthe Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and characterize the degree of\nbar-driven non-circular motions. For the first time, we find tight relations\nbetween the bar strength (bar ellipticity and torque parameter) and the degree\nof stellar non-circular motions. We also find that bar strength is strongly\nassociated with the stellar radial velocity driven by bars. Our results imply\nthat stronger bars exhibit stronger non-circular motions. Non-circular motions\nbeyond the bar are found to be weak, comprising less than 10% of the strength\nof the circular motions. We find that galaxies with a boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge\nexhibit a higher degree of non-circular motions and higher stellar radial\nvelocity compared to galaxies without a B/P bulge, by 30-50%. However, this\neffect could be attributed to the presence of strong bars in galaxies with a\nB/P feature in our sample, which would naturally result in higher radial\nmotions, rather than to B/P bulges themselves inducing stronger radial motions.\nMore observational studies, utilizing both stellar and gaseous kinematics on\nstatistically complete samples, along with numerical studies, are necessary to\ndraw a comprehensive view of the impact that B/P bulges have on bar-driven\nnon-circular motions.",

    "abstract": "Synchrotron X-ray emission has been detected from nearly a dozen young\nsupernova remnants (SNRs). X-rays of synchrotron origin exhibit linear\npolarization in a regular, non-randomly oriented magnetic field. The\nsignificant polarized X-ray emission from four such SNRs has already been\nreported on the basis of observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry\nExplorer (IXPE). The magnetic-field structure as derived from IXPE observations\nis radial for Cassiopeia A, Tycho's SNR, and SN 1006, and tangential for RX\nJ1713.7-3946. The latter together with the recent detection of a tangential\nmagnetic field in SNR 1E 0102.2-7219 by the Australia Telescope Compact Array\nin the radio band shows that tangential magnetic fields can also be present in\nyoung SNRs. Thus, the dichotomy in polarization between young and middle-aged\nSNRs (radial magnetic fields in young SNRs, but tangential magnetic fields in\nmiddle-aged SNRs), previously noticed in the radio band, deserves additional\nattention. The present analysis of IXPE observations determines, for the first\ntime, a magnetic-field structure in the northwestern rim of Vela Jr, also known\nas RX J0852.0-4622, and provides a new example of a young SNR with a tangential\nmagnetic field.",

For such a purpose, consensus mechanisms are compared,\nrecommendations for reducing network communications energy consumption are\nprovided, techniques for data storage and validation are suggested and diverse\noptimizations are proposed both for software and hardware components.

Intense\nterahertz fields have enabled metal-insulator transitions, superconductivity,\nquantum paraelectric ferroelectricity, and room-temperature magnetization via\ncircularly polarized terahertz electric fields. These effects hinge on the\nexcitation of infrared-active soft phonon modes by terahertz fields. Expanding\nthis concept, recent theory suggests that ferroelectric polarization may be\nmanipulated through terahertz twisted light, transferring orbital angular\nmomentum to create ferroelectric skyrmions. Our study experimentally\ndemonstrates that such control is possible in quasi-2D ferroelectric CsBiNb2O7\nusing twisted UV light with orbital angular momentum (OAM). By resonantly\nexciting both the ferroelectric mode and the octahedral tilting mode, twisted\nUV light dynamically modulates the ferroelectric polarization. We employ\nin-situ X-ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, twisted optical Raman\nspectroscopy, and density functional theory to three-dimensionally resolve\nionic displacement fields and polarization texture changes. Our observations\nreveal deterministic, reversible twisted light-induced strain and ionic\ndisplacements within the unit cell, causing substantial microscopic\npolarization changes. This interaction between twisted photons, phonon modes,\nand induced ionic displacements breaks symmetry and stabilizes a\nnon-equilibrium ferroelectric phase with topological solitons. These findings\noffer a new path to control ferroelectricity and magnetism, opening avenues for\nnovel optoelectronic devices such as ultrafast non-volatile memory switches by\nusing light to coherently control ferroic states.",

Advances in artificial intelligence now provide an\nopportunity to make inhibitor discovery smarter than ever before.

Instead, our work proposes a new method of computer-assisted inhibitor\ndiscovery: de novo pocket-aware peptide structure and sequence generation\nnetwork.

By leveraging angle\nand dihedral relationships between backbone atoms, we ensure an E(3)-invariant\nrepresentation of peptide structures.

In this paper, we consider when $\\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is $k$-connected\nwhere a graph is $k$-connected if it remains connected after removing any $k-1$\nor less vertices. We first consider $\\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ when $Y$ is a complete\ngraph or star graph. We find tight bounds on their connectivity, proving their\nconnectivity equals their minimum degree. We further consider the size of the\nconnected components of $\\mathsf{FS}(X,\\mathsf{Star}_n)$ where $X$ is\nconnected. We show that asymptotically similar conditions as the conditions\nmentioned by Bangachev are sufficient for $\\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ to be\n$k$-connected.

The\nradiologists examining these spinal scans naturally focus on spinal pathologies\nand might miss other types of abnormalities, and in particular, abdominal ones,\nsuch as malignancies. Nevertheless, the patients whose spine was scanned might\nas well have malignant and other abdominal pathologies. Thus, clinicians have\nsuggested the need for computerized assistance and decision support in\nscreening spinal scans for additional abnormalities. In the current study, We\nhave addressed the important case of detecting suspicious lesions in the\nadrenal glands as an example for the overall methodology we have developed. A\npatient CT scan is integrated from multiple slices with an axial orientation.\nOur method determines whether a patient has an abnormal adrenal gland, and\nlocalises the abnormality if it exists. Our method is composed of three deep\nlearning models; each model has a different task for achieving the final goal.\nWe call our compound method the Multi Model Graph Aggregation MMGA method. The\nnovelty in this study is twofold. First, the use, for an important screening\ntask, of CT scans that are originally focused and tuned for imaging the spine,\nwhich were acquired from patients with potential spinal disorders, for\ndetection of a totally different set of abnormalities such as abdominal Adrenal\nglands pathologies. Second, we have built a complex pipeline architecture\ncomposed from three deep learning models that can be utilized for other organs\n(such as the pancreas or the kidney), or for similar applications, but using\nother types of imaging, such as MRI.",

Our results generalize the description of\nnon-commutative localizations of rings in terms of weight-exact localizations\ngiven in an earlier paper of the first author. That paper was essentially\ndevoted to weight-exact localizations by compactly generated subcategories,\nwhereas in the current text we focus on \"more complicated\" localizations.\n  We recall that two types of localizations of the sort we are interested in\nwere studied by several authors. They took C=D(R-mod); the heart of the first\nt-structure was equivalent to R-mod, and the second heart was equivalent to the\nexact abelian category $U_{contra}\\subset R-mod$ of U-contramodules\n(corresponding to a set of Proj R-mod-morphisms U related either to a\nhomological ring epimorphism $u:R\\to UU$ or to an ideal of I of R). The functor\n$R-mod\\to U_{contra}$ induced by pi is a certain completion one. Consequently,\nthe hearts of the corresponding weight structures are equivalent to Proj R-mod\nand to the subcategory of projective objects of U_{contra}, respectively.\nMoreover, the connecting functors between these categories are isomorphic to\nones coming from any weight structure class-generated by a single compact\nobject whose endomorphism ring is R^{op}; in particular, one can take R=Z and\nC=SH and re-prove some important statements due to Bousfield.",

    "abstract": "1T1R (1-transistor-1-resistor) memory crossbar arrays represent a promising\nsolution for compute-in-memory matrix-vector multiplication accelerators and\nembedded or storage-class memory. However, the size and scaling of these arrays\nare hindered by critical challenges, such as the IR drop on metal lines and the\naccumulation of leakage current from the transistors. Although the IR drop\nissue has been extensively investigated, the impact of transistor leakage\ncurrent has received limited attention. In this work, we investigate both\nissues and highlight how transistor leakage in 1T1R arrays has effects similar\nto IR drop, which degrades the memory cell sensing margin, especially as the\ntechnology node scales down. This degradation could pose reliability concerns,\nparticularly where the on/off ratio or sensing margin of memristors is\ncritical. We characterized the joint effects of transistor read resistance,\ntransistor leakage current, and IR drop as the array size scales up and the\nfabrication node scales down. Based on a model developed using specifications\nof a 22nm FDSOI technology, we found that an optimal resistance range of\nmemristors exists for good array scaling capability, where the transistor read\nresistance and the IR drop issue establish a lower resistance boundary, while\nthe transistor leakage issue sets an upper resistance boundary. This work\nprovides valuable scaling guidelines for engineering the properties of\nmemristor devices in 1T1R memory arrays.",

We take into account that the low-mass disk has an\nextended region that is optically thin along the rotation axis. We consider\nirradiation by both the host star and the donor. The migration path of a planet\nin such a disk is determined by the migration rate varying during the disk\nevolution. Giant planets may open/close the gap several times over the disk\nlifetime. We identify the new type of migration specific to parts of the\ngrowing disk with a considerable radial gradient of an aspect ratio. Its rate\nis enclosed between the type 2 and the fast type 1 migration rates being\ndetermined by the ratio of time and radial derivatives of the disk aspect\nratio. Rapid growth of the wind rate just before the envelope loss by the donor\nleads to the formation of a zone of decretion, which may lead to substantial\noutward migration.

Even anonymized profiling methods remain vulnerable to\nre-identification attacks through these quasi-identifiers. This paper\nintroduces a novel privacy-enhanced adaptive authentication protocol that\nleverages Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF), anonymous tokens, and\nDifferential Privacy (DP) to provide robust privacy guarantees. Our proposed\napproach dynamically adjusts authentication requirements based on real-time\nrisk assessments, enhancing security while safeguarding user privacy. By\nintegrating privacy considerations into the core of adaptive risk-based\nadaptive authentication, this approach addresses a gap often overlooked in\ntraditional models. Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure confidentiality,\nintegrity, and unlinkability of user data, while differential privacy\nmechanisms minimize the impact of individual data points on overall analysis.\nFormal security and privacy proofs demonstrate the protocol's resilience\nagainst various threats and its ability to provide strong privacy guarantees.\nAdditionally, a comprehensive performance evaluation reveals that the\ncomputational and communication overheads are manageable, making the protocol\npractical for real-world deployment. By adhering to data protection regulations\nsuch as GDPR and CCPA, our protocol not only enhances security but also fosters\nuser trust and compliance with legal standards.",

In this\npaper, we present SympCam, a new 3D convolutional architecture tailored to the\ntask of remote sympathetic arousal prediction. Our model incorporates a\ntemporal attention module (TAM) to enhance the temporal coherence of our\nsequential data processing capabilities. The predictions from our method\nimprove accuracy metrics of sympathetic arousal in prior work by 48% to a mean\ncorrelation of 0.77. We additionally compare our method with common remote\nphotoplethysmography (rPPG) networks and show that they alone cannot accurately\npredict sympathetic arousal \"out-of-the-box\". Furthermore, we show that the\nsympathetic arousal predicted by our method allows detecting physical stress\nwith a balanced accuracy of 90% - an improvement of 61% compared to the rPPG\nmethod commonly used in related work, demonstrating the limitations of using\nrPPG alone. Finally, we contribute a dataset designed explicitly for the task\nof remote sympathetic arousal prediction. Our dataset contains synchronized\nface and hand videos of 20 participants from two cameras synchronized with\nelectrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements. We\nwill make this dataset available to the community and use it to evaluate the\nmethods in this paper.

However, reality is more complex and includes\nnoise, making traditional models assumptions not met in the market. In this\npaper, we explore the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to\nobtain optimal production strategies in microeconomic market environments to\novercome the limitations of traditional models. Concretely, we propose a\nDRL-based approach to obtain an effective policy in competitive markets with\nmultiple producers, each optimizing their production decisions in response to\nfluctuating demand, supply, prices, subsidies, fixed costs, total production\ncurve, elasticities and other effects contaminated by noise. Our framework\nenables agents to learn adaptive production policies to several simulations\nthat consistently outperform static and random strategies. As the deep neural\nnetworks used by the agents are universal approximators of functions, DRL\nalgorithms can represent in the network complex patterns of data learnt by\ntrial and error that explain the market. Through extensive simulations, we\ndemonstrate how DRL can capture the intricate interplay between production\ncosts, market prices, and competitor behavior, providing insights into optimal\ndecision-making in dynamic economic settings. The results show that agents\ntrained with DRL can strategically adjust production levels to maximize\nlong-term profitability, even in the face of volatile market conditions.

Current research is limited by the use of\nsingle-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain\ngeneralization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers\nreproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first\nopen foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000\nhours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly\navailable datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that\nleverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals,\nenabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional\ncontrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art\ntime-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20\ntasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep\ndisorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model\ndemonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression\nmetrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei\nachieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient,\noutperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model\nrobustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias\nevaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and\nan encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal\nhealth monitoring.",

This is necessary for building\ntrust and transparency in AI-based systems, leading to the emergence of the\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field.

CELS learns a\nsaliency map for the interest of an instance and generates a counterfactual\nexplanation guided by the learned saliency map. While CELS represents the first\nattempt to exploit learned saliency maps not only to provide intuitive\nexplanations for the reason behind the decision made by the time series\nclassifier but also to explore post hoc counterfactual explanations, it\nexhibits limitations in terms of high validity for the sake of ensuring high\nproximity and sparsity.

Our proposed\nmethod addresses this limitation by removing mask normalization to provide more\ninformative and valid counterfactual explanations.

Even modest increases in $n$ can blow\nup the leading constant too much to be worth the slight decrease in the\nexponent of $M$. Meanwhile, the asymptotically best algorithms use very large\n$n$, such that $n^2$ is larger than the number of atoms in the visible\nuniverse!\n  In this paper, we give new ways to use tensor rank bounds to design matrix\nmultiplication algorithms, which lead to smaller leading constants than the\nstandard recursive method.

    "abstract": "Benchmarking of noise that is induced during the implementation of quantum\ngates is the main concern for practical quantum computers. Several protocols\nhave been proposed that empirically calculate various metrics that quantify the\nerror rates of the quantum gates chosen from a preferred gate set. Unitarity\nrandomized benchmarking (URB) protocol is a method to estimate the coherence of\nnoise induced by the quantum gates which is measured by the metric\n\\textit{unitarity}. In this paper, we for the first time, implement the URB\nprotocol in a quantum simulator with all the parameters and noise model are\nused from a real quantum device. The direct implementation of the URB protocol\nin a quantum device is not possible using current technologies, as it requires\nthe preparation of mixed states. To overcome this challenge, we propose a\nmodification of the URB protocol, namely the m-URB protocol, that enables us to\npractically implement it on any quantum device. We validate our m-URB protocol\nusing two single-qubit noise channels -- (a) depolarising channel and (b)\nbit-flip channel. We further alter the m-URB protocol, namely, native gate URB\nor Ng-URB protocol, to study the noise in the native gates into which the\nquantum circuits are compiled in a quantum computer. Using our Ng-URB protocol,\nwe can also detect the presence of cross-talk errors which are correlated\nerrors caused due to non-local and entangling gates such as CNOT gate. For\nillustration, we simulate the noise of the native gates taking the noise\nparameter from two real IBM-Q processors.",

In this paper, we introduce CodeRosetta, an\nencoder-decoder transformer model designed specifically for translating between\nprogramming languages and their HPC extensions. CodeRosetta is evaluated on C++\nto CUDA and Fortran to C++ translation tasks. It uses a customized learning\nframework with tailored pretraining and training objectives to effectively\ncapture both code semantics and parallel structural nuances, enabling\nbidirectional translation. Our results show that CodeRosetta outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in C++ to CUDA translation by 2.9 BLEU and 1.72\nCodeBLEU points while improving compilation accuracy by 6.05%. Compared to\ngeneral closed-source LLMs, our method improves C++ to CUDA translation by\n22.08 BLEU and 14.39 CodeBLEU, with 2.75% higher compilation accuracy.

Consequently,\nself-heating effects can lead to electrothermal instabilities in planar thin\nfilm devices of these materials. When the electrical bias current exceeds a\ndevice-specific threshold, the device can switch from a high- to a\nlow-resistance state through the formation of metallic filaments. However,\nsince the current and temperature redistribution effects that create these\nfilaments are sustained by local Joule heating, a reduction of the bias current\nbelow a second (lower) threshold leads to the disappearance of filaments, and\nthe device switches back into the high-resistance state. Hence, electrothermal\nresistive switching is usually volatile. Here, on the contrary, we report on\nnon-volatile resistive switching in a planar $\\mathrm{NdNiO}_3$ thin-film\ndevice. By combining electrical transport measurements with optical wide-field\nmicroscopy, we provide evidence for a metallic filament that persists even\nafter returning the bias current to zero. We attribute this effect to the\npronounced hysteresis between the cooling and heating branches in the\nresistance vs. temperature dependence of the device. At least one hundred\nintermediate resistance states can be prepared, which are persistent as long as\nthe base temperature is kept constant. Further, the switching process is\nnon-destructive, and thermal cycling can reset the device to its pristine\nstate.",

The\nmethod dynamically captures the uncertainty of surrounding vehicles by online\nestimation of their acceleration bounds, enabling a reactive but rapid\nunderstanding of the uncertainty characteristics of the surrounding vehicles.\nBy leveraging these estimated bounds, a non-conservative forward occupancy of\nsurrounding vehicles is predicted over a horizon, which is incorporated in both\nthe decision-making process and the motion-planning strategy, to enhance the\nresilience and safety of the planned reference trajectory. The method\nsuccessfully fulfills the tasks in challenging forced merging scenarios, and\nthe properties are illustrated by comparison with several alternative\napproaches.",

In this paper, we investigate a fundamental question: is moral\nself-correction an innate capability in LLMs? To explore this, we conduct (1) a\nmechanistic analysis of how key components of self-correction, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and external feedback, interact to enable\nmoral self-correction; and (2) a behavioral analysis of LLMs' ability to\ndistinguish between desired and undesired outputs, introducing a\nself-distinguish framework. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that LLMs struggle\nto effectively leverage helpful feedback, and conflicts can arise between\nfeedback and CoT reasoning. These limitations suggest that LLMs fail to\nidentify useful contextual information, instead prioritizing their own internal\nknowledge. Additionally, our behavioral analysis indicates that LLMs struggle\nto differentiate among their own outputs. Based on these empirical findings\nacross two analytical dimensions, mechanism and behavior, we argue that moral\nself-correction is not an innate capability of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has\ntransformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological\nphenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins,\nand signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has\nonly become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements\nat scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence''\ntechniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging\n``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical\nunderstanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology\nmust be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living\nworld. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory\nrequires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the\ngene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major\nchallenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a\nlarge number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical\nobjects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a\nmanner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional\nstatistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium;\n(4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types\nof constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by\ndiscussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing\na statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a\nlinear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological\nresource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.",

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process.

PySCo\nemploys Particle-Mesh solvers, using multigrid or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nmethods in their different variations. Additionally, PySCo can be easily\nintegrated as an external library, providing utilities for particle and mesh\ncomputations. The library offers key features, including an initial condition\ngenerator based on up to third-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT),\npower spectrum estimation, and computes the background and growth of density\nperturbations. In this paper, we detail PySCo's architecture and algorithms and\nconduct extensive comparisons with other codes and numerical methods. Our\nanalysis shows that, with sufficient small-scale resolution, the power spectrum\nat redshift $z = 0$ remains independent of the initial redshift at the 0.1\\%\nlevel for $z_{\\rm ini} \\geq$ 125, 30, and 10 when using first, second, and\nthird-order LPT, respectively. Although the seven-point Laplacian method used\nin multigrid also leads to power suppression on small scales, this effect can\nlargely be mitigated when computing ratios. In terms of performance, PySCo only\nrequires approximately one CPU hour to complete a Newtonian simulation with\n$512^3$ particles (and an equal number of cells) on a laptop. Due to its speed\nand ease of use, PySCo is ideal for rapidly generating vast ensemble of\nsimulations and exploring parameter spaces, allowing variations in gravity\ntheories, dark energy models, and numerical approaches.

To\nachieve these objectives, we rely on compiler autovectorization. We leverage a\nset of hardware and software tools that allow us to analyze in detail where\nautovectorization is suboptimal.

We\nevaluate the performance on an innovative configurable platform powered by a\nRISC-V core coupled with a wide vector unit capable of operating with up to 256\ndouble precision elements. Following the vectorization process, we demonstrate\na single-core speedup of 7.6$\\times$ compared to its scalar implementation.\nFurthermore, we show that code portability is not compromised, as our solution\ncontinues to exhibit performance benefits, or at the very least, no drawbacks,\non other HPC architectures such as Intel x86 and NEC SX-Aurora.",

However, achieving fast\nconvergence in DML in these heterogeneous environments remains a significant\nchallenge. Traditional frameworks like Bulk Synchronous Parallel and\nAsynchronous Stochastic Parallel rely on frequent, small updates that incur\nsubstantial communication overhead and hinder convergence speed. Furthermore,\nthese frameworks often employ static dataset sizes, neglecting the\nheterogeneity of edge devices and potentially leading to straggler nodes that\nslow down the entire training process. The straggler nodes, i.e., edge devices\nthat take significantly longer to process their assigned data chunk, hinder the\noverall training speed. To address these limitations, this paper proposes\nHermes, a novel probabilistic framework for efficient DML on edge devices. This\nframework leverages a dynamic threshold based on recent test loss behavior to\nidentify statistically significant improvements in the model's generalization\ncapability, hence transmitting updates only when major improvements are\ndetected, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead. Additionally,\nHermes employs dynamic dataset allocation to optimize resource utilization and\nprevents performance degradation caused by straggler nodes. Our evaluations on\na real-world heterogeneous resource-constrained environment demonstrate that\nHermes achieves faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art methods,\nresulting in a remarkable $13.22$x reduction in training time and a $62.1\\%$\ndecrease in communication overhead.",

    "abstract": "High-cadence high-resolution spectroscopic observations of infant Type II\nsupernovae (SNe) represent an exquisite probe of the atmospheres and winds of\nexploding red-supergiant (RSG) stars. Using radiation hydrodynamics and\nradiative transfer, we study the gas and radiation properties during and after\nthe phase of shock breakout, considering RSG progenitors enshrouded within a\ncircumstellar material (CSM) that varies in extent, density, and velocity\nprofile. In all cases, the original, unadulterated CSM structure is probed only\nat the onset of shock breakout, visible in high-resolution spectra as narrow,\noften blueshifted emission, possibly with an absorption trough. As the SN\nluminosity rises during breakout, radiative acceleration of the unshocked CSM\nstarts, leading to a broadening of the ``narrow'' lines by ~100 and up to\n~1000km/s, depending on CSM properties. This acceleration is maximum close to\nthe shock, where the radiative flux is greater, and thus typically masked by\noptical-depth effects. Generally, narrow-line broadening is greater for more\ncompact, tenuous CSM because of the proximity to the shock where the flux is\nborn, and smaller in denser and more extended CSM.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Risk-Averse Just-In-Time (RAJIT) operation scheme for\nAmmonia-Hydrogen-based Micro-Grids (AHMGs) to boost\nelectricity-hydrogen-ammonia coupling under uncertainties. First, an off-grid\nAHMG model is developed, featuring a novel multi-mode ammonia synthesis process\nand a hydrogen-ammonia dual gas turbine with tunable feed-in ratios.\nSubsequently, a state-behavior mapping strategy linking hydrogen storage levels\nwith the operation modes of ammonia synthesis is established to prevent\ncost-ineffective shutdowns. The proposed model substantially improves\noperational flexibility but results in a challenging nonlinear fractional\nprogram. Based upon this model, a data-driven RAJIT scheme is developed for the\nreal-time rolling optimization of AHMGs. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all\nschemes using one optimization method throughout, the data driven RAJIT\nintelligently switches between cost-effective deterministic optimization and\nrisk-averse online-learning distributionally robust optimization depending on\nactual risk profiles, thus capitalizing on the respective strengths of these\ntwo optimization methods. To facilitate the solution of the resulting nonlinear\nprogram, we develop an equivalent-reformulation-based solution methodology by\nleveraging a constraint-tightening technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate\nthat the proposed scheme guarantees safety and yields an overall cost reduction\nup to 14.6% compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work,\nwe dramatically expand a notion of decision sparsity called the Sparse\nExplanation Value(SEV) so that its explanations are more meaningful.

By allowing\nflexibility in that reference and by considering how distances along the\nhypercube translate to distances in feature space, we can derive sparser and\nmore meaningful explanations for various types of function classes.

Currently, most existing hardening\nstrategies focus on reducing load shedding. However, for electricity-hydrogen\ndistribution networks (EHDNs), the leakage risk of hydrogen should be\ncontrolled to avoid severe incidents such as explosions. To this end, this\npaper proposes an optimal hardening strategy for EHDNs under extreme weather,\naiming to minimize load shedding while limiting the leakage risk of hydrogen\npipelines. Specifically, modified failure uncertainty models for power lines\nand hydrogen pipelines are developed. These models characterize not only the\neffect of hardening, referred to as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs),\nbut also the influence of disaster intensity correlations on failure\nprobability distributions. Subsequently, a hardening decision framework is\nestablished, based on the two-stage distributionally robust optimization\nincorporating a hydrogen leakage chance constraint (HLCC). To enhance the\ncomputational efficiency of HLCC under discrete DDUs, an efficient\nsecond-order-cone transformation is introduced. Moreover, to address the\nintractable inverse of the second-order moment under DDUs, lifted variables are\nadopted to refine the main-cross moments. These reformulate the hardening\nproblem as a two-stage mixed-integer second-order-cone programming, and finally\nsolved by the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Case studies\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",

Existing methods\noften employ single guidance model to generate the guidance features from\noptical images to assist thermal UAV images super-resolution. However, single\nguidance models make it difficult to generate effective guidance features under\nfavorable and adverse conditions in UAV scenarios, thus limiting the\nperformance of OTUAV-SR. To address this issue, we propose a novel Guidance\nDisentanglement network (GDNet), which disentangles the optical image\nrepresentation according to typical UAV scenario attributes to form guidance\nfeatures under both favorable and adverse conditions, for robust OTUAV-SR.\nMoreover, we design an attribute-aware fusion module to combine all\nattribute-based optical guidance features, which could form a more\ndiscriminative representation and fit the attribute-agnostic guidance process.\nTo facilitate OTUAV-SR research in complex UAV scenarios, we introduce\nVGTSR2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset containing 3,500 aligned\noptical-thermal image pairs captured under diverse conditions and scenes.\nExtensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 demonstrate that GDNet significantly improves\nOTUAV-SR performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially in the\nchallenging low-light and foggy environments commonly encountered in UAV\nscenarios.

Despite\nadvancements in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, forecasting total\ncloud cover remains challenging due to the small-scale nature of cloud\nformation processes. In this study, we introduce CloudCast, a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture, designed to predict total\ncloud cover (TCC) up to five hours ahead. Trained on five years of satellite\ndata, CloudCast significantly outperforms traditional NWP models and optical\nflow methods. Compared to a reference NWP model, CloudCast achieves a 24% lower\nmean absolute error and reduces multi-category prediction errors by 46%. The\nmodel demonstrates strong performance, particularly in capturing the\nlarge-scale structure of cloud cover in the first few forecast hours, though\nlater predictions are subject to blurring and underestimation of cloud\nformation. An ablation study identified the optimal input features and loss\nfunctions, with MAE-based models performing the best. CloudCast has been\nintegrated into the Finnish Meteorological Institute's operational nowcasting\nsystem, where it improves cloud cover forecasts used by public and private\nsector clients. While CloudCast is limited by a relatively short skillful lead\ntime of about three hours, future work aims to extend this through more complex\nnetwork architectures and higher-resolution data.

This identifies a\ntransferable set of magnetic interactions applicable to the extended family of\nmagnetic topological insulators based on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-Bi$_2$Te$_3$\nheterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally\nincreases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent\ncryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of\npolymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) > DP=15 (P15) > DP=3 (P3). Herein, we\nemploy molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism\nbehind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the\npopulation of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the\nprimary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and\nmulti-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level,\nPPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L)\nand coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its\nstronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher\ncontent of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI\nactivity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity\nstems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At\nthe multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to\naggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread\nat the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice\nsurface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes\nsignificantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic\neffect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic\nrelationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights\nfor the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.",

Recent top-performing approaches are\nprompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts)\nto encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the\nfixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task.\nHowever, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt\nselection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task\nloss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate\nadaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task.

The super epoch analysis was\ncarried out to determine the general response of L-shell, pitch angle, and\nenergy-dependency of relativistic electrons to HILDCAAs. The analysis reveals a\nsignificant flux enhancement in the relativistic electron fluxes, predominantly\noccurring with a delay of 0 to 2 days following the onset of HILDCAA events.\nThe general response indicates that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons\nreaches up to 6 MeV.

The\nobserved time-delayed and pitch angle-dependent response related to the onset\nof HILDCAAs highlights the significant influence of wave-particle interactions,\nparticularly in relation to ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in this context.\nThis is further supported by ground-based magnetometers and in-situ magnetic\nfield observations from the RBSP probe, which demonstrated enhanced power of\nULF waves during HILDCAA events.

Traditional Transformer models, though adept with sequential\ndata, do not effectively preserve these multi-dimensional structures, as their\ninternal operations in effect flatten multi-dimensional observations into\nvectors, thereby losing critical multi-dimensional relationships and patterns.\nTo address this, we introduce the Tensor-Augmented Transformer (TEAFormer), a\nnovel method that incorporates tensor expansion and compression within the\nTransformer framework to maintain and leverage the inherent multi-dimensional\nstructures, thus reducing computational costs and improving prediction\naccuracy. The core feature of the TEAFormer, the Tensor-Augmentation (TEA)\nmodule, utilizes tensor expansion to enhance multi-view feature learning and\ntensor compression for efficient information aggregation and reduced\ncomputational load. The TEA module is not just a specific model architecture\nbut a versatile component that is highly compatible with the attention\nmechanism and the encoder-decoder structure of Transformers, making it\nadaptable to existing Transformer architectures. Our comprehensive experiments,\nwhich integrate the TEA module into three popular time series Transformer\nmodels across three real-world benchmarks, show significant performance\nenhancements, highlighting the potential of TEAFormers for cutting-edge time\nseries forecasting.",

In this work, guided by an extended version of\nLindemann theory that considers the contribution of both the\nradiation-activation and collision-activation to the rate constant of\nunimolecular reactions, we show that the relative importance of the two\nmechanisms can be measured by a dimensionless number $PR$ that is the ratio of\nthe collision frequency to the radiation absorption rate of the molecule. The\nreaction kinetic is dominated by collision-activation or by radiation\nactivation depending on whether $PR$ is larger or smaller than a reference\nvalue $PR^*$, which is determined to be $PR^* \\approx 10$ based on magnitudes\nof molecular properties and is verified by detailed calculations of a number of\ntypical interstellar unimolecular reactions. This method of evaluating the\nrelative importance of the two mechanisms is checked against master equation\ncalculations of two interstellar reactions: the dissociation reaction of\nsilicilic acid around the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and the methyl\nassociation in Titan's atmosphere, and the validity is verified.

Here we show that this could\nalso have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of crystal melting.\nNamely, when considering the empirically founded 2/3-rule, stating that the\nratio of Tg and the melting temperature Tm is about 2/3 for almost all\nmaterials, for crystals a similar relation, $\\alpha_c/m\\propto 1/T_m$, should\napply. Indeed, we find that the available experimental data are well consistent\nwith such a relation. This implies that the melting of a crystal into an\nordinary (non-supercooled) liquid is influenced by the fragility, a property\nquantifying the non-Arrhenius dynamics in the supercooled-liquid state of the\nmaterial. We argue that this can be explained by a significant enhancement of\nthe \"ideal\" (non-cooperative) melting temperature arising from the\ncooperativity of the particle motion in the liquid state above Tm. Therefore, a\nreassessment of the currently widely accepted microscopic understanding of\ncrystal melting, still founded on the general ideas that lead to the\ntime-honored Lindemann melting criterion, may be necessary.",

This implies a region of\nliquid water beneath the surface ice shell. Since liquid water would be\nessential for the origin of life, it is important to understand the development\nof these internal oceans, particularly their temperature distribution and\nevolution. The balance between tidal heating and radiative cooling is believed\nto sustain liquid water beneath an icy moon's surface. We aim to simulate the\ntidal heating of an internal ocean in an icy moon using 3-dimensional numerical\nfluid calculations with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We\nincorporated viscosity and thermal conduction terms into the governing\nequations of SPH. However, we encountered two issues while calculating rigid\nbody rotation using SPH with a viscous term: (1) conventional viscosity\nformulations generated unphysical forces that hindered rotation, and (2) there\nwas artificial internal energy partitioning within the layered structure, which\nwas due to the standard SPH formulations. To address the first issue, we\nmodified the viscosity formulation.For the second, we adopted Density\nIndependent SPH (DISPH) developed in previous studies to improve behavior at\ndiscontinuous surfaces. Additionally, we implemented radiative cooling using an\nalgorithm to define fluid surfaces via the particle method. We also introduced\nan equation of state accounting for phase transitions. With these\nmodifications, we have refined the SPH method to encompass all necessary\nphysical processes for simulating the evolution of icy moons with internal\noceans.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have proven to be extremely powerful, however, they are\nalso vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can cause hazardous incorrect\npredictions in safety-critical applications. Certified robustness via\nrandomized smoothing gives a probabilistic guarantee that the smoothed\nclassifier's predictions will not change within an $\\ell_2$-ball around a given\ninput. On the other hand (uncertainty) score-based rejection is a technique\noften applied in practice to defend models against adversarial attacks. In this\nwork, we fuse these two approaches by integrating a classifier that abstains\nfrom predicting when uncertainty is high into the certified robustness\nframework. This allows us to derive two novel robustness guarantees for\nuncertainty aware classifiers, namely (i) the radius of an $\\ell_2$-ball around\nthe input in which the same label is predicted and uncertainty remains low and\n(ii) the $\\ell_2$-radius of a ball in which the predictions will either not\nchange or be uncertain. While the former provides robustness guarantees with\nrespect to attacks aiming at increased uncertainty, the latter informs about\nthe amount of input perturbation necessary to lead the uncertainty aware model\ninto a wrong prediction. Notably, this is on CIFAR10 up to 20.93% larger than\nfor models not allowing for uncertainty based rejection. We demonstrate, that\nthe novel framework allows for a systematic robustness evaluation of different\nnetwork architectures and uncertainty measures and to identify desired\nproperties of uncertainty quantification techniques.

It is primarily\nbecause of the lack of a large-scale, well-annotated night-time benchmark for\nrigorously evaluating tracking algorithms. To this end, this paper presents\nNT-VOT211, a new benchmark tailored for evaluating visual object tracking\nalgorithms in the challenging night-time conditions. NT-VOT211 consists of 211\ndiverse videos, offering 211,000 well-annotated frames with 8 attributes\nincluding camera motion, deformation, fast motion, motion blur, tiny target,\ndistractors, occlusion and out-of-view. To the best of our knowledge, it is the\nlargest night-time tracking benchmark to-date that is specifically designed to\naddress unique challenges such as adverse visibility, image blur, and\ndistractors inherent to night-time tracking scenarios. Through a comprehensive\nanalysis of results obtained from 42 diverse tracking algorithms on NT-VOT211,\nwe uncover the strengths and limitations of these algorithms, highlighting\nopportunities for enhancements in visual object tracking, particularly in\nenvironments with suboptimal lighting. Besides, a leaderboard for revealing\nperformance rankings, annotation tools, comprehensive meta-information and all\nthe necessary code for reproducibility of results is made publicly available.\nWe believe that our NT-VOT211 benchmark will not only be instrumental in\nfacilitating field deployment of VOT algorithms, but will also help VOT\nenhancements and it will unlock new real-world tracking applications.

For the magnetic-electric RN spacetime, the Carrollian extremal\nsurfaces (CESs) divide the spacetime into several geodesically complete\nregions, and the geodesics can only travel in one of these regions.

    "abstract": "Large language models are probabilistic models, and the process of generating\ncontent is essentially sampling from the output distribution of the language\nmodel. Existing watermarking techniques inject watermarks into the generated\ncontent without altering the output quality. On the other hand, existing\nacceleration techniques, specifically speculative sampling, leverage a draft\nmodel to speed up the sampling process while preserving the output\ndistribution. However, there is no known method to simultaneously accelerate\nthe sampling process and inject watermarks into the generated content. In this\npaper, we investigate this direction and find that the integration of\nwatermarking and acceleration is non-trivial. We prove a no-go theorem, which\nstates that it is impossible to simultaneously maintain the highest watermark\nstrength and the highest sampling efficiency. Furthermore, we propose two\nmethods that maintain either the sampling efficiency or the watermark strength,\nbut not both. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for\nunderstanding the inherent trade-off between watermark strength and sampling\nefficiency in accelerating the generation of watermarked tokens for large\nlanguage models.

The recently reported gravitational-wave source GW230529 has been\nconfidently identified as a NSBH merger, with the BH mass falling within this\nlower mass gap. This detection provides strong evidence against the existence\nof the latter and introduces new implications for the coalescing NSBH\npopulation, including a revised BH mass distribution and an updated local\nmerger rate. In this study, we employ POSYDON, a binary population synthesis\ncode that integrates detailed single- and binary-star models, to investigate\ncoalescing NSBH binaries formed through isolated binary evolution. In\nparticular, we focus on the BH mass distribution of the intrinsic NSBH merger\npopulation. We find that, with a high common-envelope efficiency of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{CE}} =2 $, the BH masses in NSBH mergers concentrate in the lower\nmass gap, aligning more closely with observations. However, after accounting\nfor the constraints of the selection bias against mass-gap BHs in LMXBs, which\nsuggests that the maximum NS birth mass is below $\\simeq 2\\,M_{\\odot}$, we find\nthat introducing a high $\\alpha_{\\rm{CE}}$ is not required to match\nobservations. Additionally, we explore the impact of core-collapse supernova\nkicks. Finally, we present the property distributions of observable NSBH\nmergers from our simulation and find that they match well with the\nobservations. We find that the fraction of electromagnetic counterparts in\nobservable populations is $\\approx 4-30\\%$, depending on different NS equations\nof state.

Mid-IR and\nUV observations have shown that several light hydrocarbons (up to 6 carbon\natoms) have altered abundances near Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Ion-neutral\nreactions influence the hydrocarbon chemistry, with light hydrocarbons produced\nin the upper stratosphere, and heavier hydrocarbons as well as aerosols\nproduced in the lower stratosphere. One consequence of the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is the existence of ionospheric jets that\npropagate into the neutral middle stratosphere, likely acting as a dynamical\nbarrier to the aurora-produced species. As the ionospheric jets and the\nbackground atmosphere do not co-rotate at the same rate, this creates a complex\nsystem where chemistry and dynamics are intertwined. The ion-neutral reactions\nproduce species with a spatial distribution following the SIII longitude system\nin the upper stratosphere. As these species sediment down to the lower\nstratosphere, and because of the progressive dynamical decoupling between the\nionospheric flows and the background atmosphere, the spatial distribution of\nthe auroral-related species progressively follows a zonal distribution with\nincreasing pressures that ultimately produces a system of polar and subpolar\nhazes that extends down to the bottom of the stratosphere.

Moreover,\nphase-sensitive schemes are mainly based on bulk crystals and require tight\nbeam focusing. Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic architecture in\nthin-film lithium niobate that addresses these challenges by exploiting the\nelectro-optic modulation induced by a terahertz signal onto an optical beam at\ntelecom frequencies. Leveraging on the low optical losses provided by this\nplatform, we integrate a double array of up to 18 terahertz antennas within a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer, considerably extending the device collection area\nand boosting the interaction efficiency between the terahertz signal and the\noptical beam. We show that the double array coherently builds up the probe\nmodulation through a mechanism of quasi-phase-matching, driven by a periodic\nterahertz near-field pattern, without physical inversion of the\ncrystallographic domains. The array periodicity controls the detection\nbandwidth and its central frequency, while the large detection area ensures\ncorrect operation with diverse terahertz beam settings. Furthermore, we show\nthat the antennas act as pixels that allow reconstruction of the terahertz beam\nprofile impinging on the detector area.

To better analyze and predict the impact of these factors,\nthis study proposes a multimodal fusion learning framework based on image\nprocessing and deep learning techniques. This framework integrates both\nelemental composition and microstructural features to accurately predict the\nVickers hardness of solid-solution Mg-Gd alloys. Initially, deep learning\nmethods were employed to extract microstructural information from a variety of\nsolid-solution Mg-Gd alloy images obtained from literature and experiments.\nThis provided precise grain size and secondary phase microstructural features\nfor performance prediction tasks. Subsequently, these quantitative analysis\nresults were combined with Gd content information to construct a performance\nprediction dataset. Finally, a regression model based on the Transformer\narchitecture was used to predict the Vickers hardness of Mg-Gd alloys. The\nexperimental results indicate that the Transformer model performs best in terms\nof prediction accuracy, achieving an R^2 value of 0.9. Additionally, SHAP\nanalysis identified critical values for four key features affecting the Vickers\nhardness of Mg-Gd alloys, providing valuable guidance for alloy design.

It compares MNA to IPv6 extension headers (EHs) that\nserve a similar purpose, and argues that MNA can be better deployed than EHs.\nIt then presents P4-MNA, a first hardware implementation running at 400 Gb/s\nper port. Scalability and performance of P4-MNA are evaluated, showing\nnegligible impact on processing delay caused by network actions. Moreover, the\napplicability of MNA is demonstrated by implementing the use cases of\nlink-specific packet loss measurement using the alternate-marking-method (AMM)\nand bandwidth reservation using network slicing. We identify header stacking\nconstraints resulting from hardware resources and from the number of network\nactions that must be supported according to the MNA encoding.

To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to propose a depth attention mechanism and to\nformulate a simple framework that allows seamlessly integration of depth\ninformation with state of the art tracking algorithms, without RGB-D cameras,\nelevating accuracy and robustness.

By computing the training phase diagram over a range of target output\namplitudes and periods, we verify that reach-limited failures depend on the\ntraining algorithm while stability-limited failures are invariant across\ndifferent algorithms.

Feature selection techniques aim to identify the most representative\nfeatures from the original high-dimensional data. Due to the absence of class\nlabel information, it is significantly more challenging to select appropriate\nfeatures in unsupervised learning scenarios compared to supervised ones.\nTraditional unsupervised feature selection methods typically score the features\nof samples based on certain criteria, treating samples indiscriminately.\nHowever, these approaches fail to fully capture the internal structure of the\ndata. The importance of different samples should vary, and there is a dual\nrelationship between the weight of samples and features that will influence\neach other. Therefore, an unsupervised feature selection algorithm based on\ndual manifold re-ranking (DMRR) is proposed in this paper. Different similarity\nmatrices are constructed to depict the manifold structures among samples,\nbetween samples and features, and among features themselves. Then, manifold\nre-ranking is performed by combining the initial scores of samples and\nfeatures. By comparing DMRR with three original unsupervised feature selection\nalgorithms and two unsupervised feature selection post-processing algorithms,\nexperimental results confirm that the importance information of different\nsamples and the dual relationship between sample and feature are beneficial for\nachieving better feature selection.",

    "abstract": "The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent\nin the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid\ncosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the\nrunning vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved\nspacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate,\n$H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological\ntensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain\nhardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy\n(DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made\nout of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should\nstress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces\npositive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the\nold $\\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter,\ncalled the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the\ncosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological\ntensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal\n(2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is\nsubstantially better than for the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth\ntension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can\nbe completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\\sigma$\nc.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the\nDESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple\nphenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite\nextensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "We propose an evolutionary competition model to investigate the green\ntransition of firms, highlighting the role of adjustment costs, dynamically\nadjusted transition risk, and green technology progress in this process. Firms\nbase their decisions to adopt either green or brown technologies on relative\nperformance. To incorporate the costs of switching to another technology into\ntheir decision-making process, we generalize the classical exponential\nreplicator dynamics. Our global analysis reveals that increasing transition\nrisk, e.g., by threatening to impose stricter environmental regulations,\neffectively incentivizes the green transition. Economic policy recommendations\nderived from our model further suggest maintaining high transition risk\nregardless of the industry's level of greenness. Subsidizing the costs of\nadopting green technologies can reduce the risk of a failed green transition.\nWhile advances in green technologies can amplify the effects of green policies,\nthey do not completely eliminate the possibility of a failed green transition.\nFinally, evolutionary pressures favor the green transition when green\ntechnologies are profitable.",

It can be significantly affected by various parameters\nof nanopores and the applied fields driving ions through porous membranes.\nHere, with finite element simulations, the selective transport of ions through\nnanopores is systematically investigated under three common fields, i.e. the\nelectric field (V), hydrostatic pressure (p), and concentration gradient (C).\nFor negatively charged nanopores, through the quantitative comparison of the\ncation selectivity (t+) under the three fields, the cation selectivity of\nnanopores follows the order of t+V > t+c > t+p. This is due to the transport\ncharacteristics of cations and anions through the nanopores. Because of the\nstrong transport of counterions in electric double layers under electric fields\nand concentration gradients, the nanopore exhibits a relatively higher\nselectivity to counterions. We also explored the modulation of t+ on the\nproperties of nanopores and solutions. Under all three fields, t+ is directly\nproportional to the pore length and surface charge density, and inversely\ncorrelated to the pore diameter and salt concentration.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the recent work by Shapiro et al. [45], we propose a Bayesian\ndistributionally robust Nash equilibrium (BDRNE) model where each player lacks\ncomplete information on the true probability distribution of the underlying\nuncertainty represented by a random variable and subsequently determines the\noptimal decision by solving a Bayesian distributionally robust optimization\n(BDRO) problem under the Nash conjecture. Unlike most of the DRO models in the\nliterature, the BDRO model assumes (a) the true unknown distribution of the\nrandom variable can be approximated by a randomized parametric family of\ndistributions, (b) the average of the worst-case expected value of the\nobjective function with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter,\ninstead of the worst-case expected value of the objective function is\nconsidered in each player's decision making, and (c) the posterior distribution\nof the parameter is updated as more and more sampling information of the random\nvariable is gathered. Under some moderate conditions, we demonstrate the\nexistence of a BDRNE and derive asymptotic convergence of the equilibrium as\nthe sample size increases. Moreover, we propose to solve the BDRNE problem by\nGauss-Seidel-type iterative method in the case when the ambiguity set of each\nplayer is constructed via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Finally, we apply\nthe BDRNE model to a price competition problem under multinomial logit demand.\nThe preliminary numerical test results show that the proposed model and\ncomputational scheme perform well.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for\nlow-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food.\nThe volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food\ninsecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions\nfurther complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring\nfood prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and\nforecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the\nAgricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology,\nintegrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to\nanalyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead,\ndynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative\nintegration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while\nproviding clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can\nbe used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean,\nand wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various\nmonths and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and\ninterpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to\ndeveloping a fair and sustainable food system.",

Here, with simulations, we investigated the characteristics of\nion transport and modulation of ICR inside bipolar nanopores. With bipolar\nnanopores of half-positive and half-negative surfaces, the most significant ICR\nphenomenon appears at various concentrations. In these cases, ICR ratios are\nindependent of electrolyte types. In other cases where nanopores have\noppositely charged surfaces in different lengths, ICR ratios are related to the\nmobility of anions and cations. The pore length and surface charge density can\nenhance ICR. As the pore length increases, ICR ratios first increase and then\napproach their saturation which is determined by the surface charge density.\nExternal surface charges of nanopores can promote the ICR phenomenon mainly due\nto the enhancement of ion enrichment inside nanopores by external surface\nconductance. The effective width of exterior charged surfaces under various\nconditions is also explored, which is inversely proportional to the pore length\nand salt concentration, and linearly related to the pore diameter, surface\ncharge density, and applied voltage.

While previous research has shown\npromise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by\nissues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on\ndiffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the\ndenoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise\nadded at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise\nvalues are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving\ndifferential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the\nnoise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating\ngeneration. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step\ndenoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original\ndata distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the\ngenerated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we\nbreak the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising\nspeed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture\naudio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising\ndistribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling\nstep, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for\nhigh-speed generation.",

    "abstract": "Generative models, as a powerful technique for generation, also gradually\nbecome a critical tool for recognition tasks. However, in skeleton-based action\nrecognition, the features obtained from existing pre-trained generative methods\ncontain redundant information unrelated to recognition, which contradicts the\nnature of the skeleton's spatially sparse and temporally consistent properties,\nleading to undesirable performance. To address this challenge, we make efforts\nto bridge the gap in theory and methodology and propose a novel skeleton-based\nidempotent generative model (IGM) for unsupervised representation learning.\nMore specifically, we first theoretically demonstrate the equivalence between\ngenerative models and maximum entropy coding, which demonstrates a potential\nroute that makes the features of generative models more compact by introducing\ncontrastive learning. To this end, we introduce the idempotency constraint to\nform a stronger consistency regularization in the feature space, to push the\nfeatures only to maintain the critical information of motion semantics for the\nrecognition task. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D\nand PKUMMD, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. On the NTU 60\nxsub dataset, we observe a performance improvement from 84.6$\\%$ to 86.2$\\%$.\nFurthermore, in zero-shot adaptation scenarios, our model demonstrates\nsignificant efficacy by achieving promising results in cases that were\npreviously unrecognizable.

The methods include ConvNet-based and Transformer-based methods.\nAlthough ConvNets can effectively utilize local information to reduce\nredundancy via small neighborhood convolution, the limited receptive field\nresults in the inability to capture global dependencies. Transformers can\nestablish long-distance dependencies via a self-attention mechanism; however,\nthe intense calculation of the relationships among all tokens leads to high\nredundancy. We propose a novel unsupervised image registration method named the\nunified Transformer and superresolution (UTSRMorph) network, which can enhance\nfeature representation learning in the encoder and generate detailed\ndisplacement fields in the decoder to overcome these problems. We first propose\na fusion attention block to integrate the advantages of ConvNets and\nTransformers, which inserts a ConvNet-based channel attention module into a\nmultihead self-attention module. The overlapping attention block, a novel\ncross-attention method, uses overlapping windows to obtain abundant\ncorrelations with match information of a pair of images. Then, the blocks are\nflexibly stacked into a new powerful encoder. The decoder generation process of\na high-resolution deformation displacement field from low-resolution features\nis considered as a superresolution process. Specifically, the superresolution\nmodule was employed to replace interpolation upsampling, which can overcome\nfeature degradation. UTSRMorph was compared to state-of-the-art registration\nmethods in the 3D brain MR (OASIS, IXI) and MR-CT datasets. The qualitative and\nquantitative results indicate that UTSRMorph achieves relatively better\nperformance.

We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique\nthat memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables\nrobust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge.

This problem may lead to biased models, where the\ntraining process is dominated by the majority class, resulting in inadequate\nrepresentation of the minority class. Universum twin support vector machine\n(UTSVM) produces a biased model towards the majority class, as a result, its\nperformance on the minority class is often poor as it might be mistakenly\nclassified as noise. Moreover, UTSVM is not proficient in handling datasets\nthat contain outliers and noises. Inspired by the concept of incorporating\nprior information about the data and employing an intuitionistic fuzzy\nmembership scheme, we propose intuitionistic fuzzy UTSVM for imbalanced data\n(IFUTSVM-ID) by enhancing overall robustness. We use an intuitionistic fuzzy\nmembership scheme to mitigate the impact of noise and outliers. Moreover, to\ntackle the problem of imbalanced class distribution, data oversampling and\nundersampling methods are utilized. Prior knowledge about the data is provided\nby universum data. This leads to better generalization performance. UTSVM is\nsusceptible to overfitting risks due to the omission of the structural risk\nminimization (SRM) principle in their primal formulations. However, the\nproposed IFUTSVM-ID model incorporates the SRM principle through the\nincorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of\noverfitting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID\nmodel on benchmark datasets from KEEL and compare it with existing baseline\nmodels.

We prove that every graph excluding a fixed odd minor is\ncontained in the strong product of two graphs each with bounded treewidth. For\ngraphs excluding a fixed minor, we strengthen the result by showing that every\nsuch graph is contained in the strong product of two digraphs with bounded\nindegree and with bounded treewidth. This result has the advantage that the\nproduct now has bounded degeneracy.\n  In the setting of 3-term products, we show that every $K_t$-minor-free graph\nis contained in $H_1\\boxtimes H_2 \\boxtimes K_{c(t)}$ where $\\text{tw}(H_i)\\leq\nt-2$. This treewidth bound is close to tight: in any such result with\n$\\text{tw}(H_i)$ bounded, both $H_1$ and $H_2$ can be forced to contain any\ngraph of treewidth $t-5$, implying $\\text{tw}(H_1)\\geq t-5$ and\n$\\text{tw}(H_2)\\geq t-5$. Analogous lower and upper bounds are shown for any\nexcluded minor, where the minimum possible bound on $\\text{tw}(H_i)$ is tied to\nthe treedepth of the excluded minor.\n  Subgraphs of the product of two graphs with bounded treewidth have two\ntree-decompositions where any bag from the first decomposition intersects any\nbag from the second decomposition in a bounded number, $k$, of vertices, so\ncalled $k$-orthogonal tree-decompositions. We show that graphs excluding a\nfixed odd-minor have a tree-decomposition and a path-decomposition that are\n$O(1)$-orthogonal. This implies that such graphs have a tree-decomposition in\nwhich each bag has bounded pathwidth. This result is best possible in that\n`pathwidth' cannot be replaced by `bandwidth' or `treedepth'. Moreover, we\ncharacterize the minor-closed classes that have a tree-decomposition in which\neach bag has bounded bandwidth, or each bag has bounded treedepth.",

However, the nonlocal homogenized model has unavoidable\ndiscrepancy from the microscale model. Such errors accumulate and propagate in\nlong-term simulations, making the resultant prediction unreliable. To develop a\nrobust and reliable bottom-up homogenization framework, we propose a new\nframework, which we coin Embedded Nonlocal Operator Regression (ENOR), to learn\na nonlocal homogenized surrogate model and its structural model error. This\nframework provides discrepancy-adaptive uncertainty quantification for\nhomogenized material response predictions in long-term simulations. The method\nis built on Nonlocal Operator Regression (NOR), an optimization-based nonlocal\nkernel learning approach, together with an embedded model error term in the\ntrainable kernel. Then, Bayesian inference is employed to infer the model error\nterm parameters together with the kernel parameters. To make the problem\ncomputationally feasible, we use a multilevel delayed acceptance Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MLDA-MCMC) method, enabling efficient Bayesian model calibration\nand model error estimation. We apply this technique to predict long-term wave\npropagation in a heterogeneous one-dimensional bar, and compare its performance\nwith additive noise models.

To enhance the generalization of KGQE models, recent studies integrate\nvarious external information (such as entity types and relation context) to\nbetter capture the logical semantics of FOL queries. The whole process is\ncommonly referred to as Query Pattern Learning (QPL). However, current QPL\nmethods typically suffer from the pattern-entity alignment bias problem,\nleading to the learned defective query patterns limiting KGQE models'\nperformance.

Unlike the external information introduced by previous QPL\nmethods, we first propose code-like instructions to express FOL queries in an\nalternative format. This format utilizes textual variables and nested tuples to\nconvey the logical semantics within FOL queries, serving as raw materials for a\nPLM-based instruction encoder to obtain complete query patterns. Building on\nthis, we design a query-guided instruction decoder to adapt query patterns to\nKGQE models.

    "abstract": "Few-shot relation extraction with none-of-the-above (FsRE with NOTA) aims at\npredicting labels in few-shot scenarios with unknown classes. FsRE with NOTA is\nmore challenging than the conventional few-shot relation extraction task, since\nthe boundaries of unknown classes are complex and difficult to learn.\nMeta-learning based methods, especially prototype-based methods, are the\nmainstream solutions to this task. They obtain the classification boundary by\nlearning the sample distribution of each class. However, their performance is\nlimited because few-shot overfitting and NOTA boundary confusion lead to\nmisclassification between known and unknown classes. To this end, we propose a\nnovel framework based on Gaussian prototype and adaptive margin named GPAM for\nFsRE with NOTA, which includes three modules, semi-factual representation,\nGMM-prototype metric learning and decision boundary learning. The first two\nmodules obtain better representations to solve the few-shot problem through\ndebiased information enhancement and Gaussian space distance measurement. The\nthird module learns more accurate classification boundaries and prototypes\nthrough adaptive margin and negative sampling. In the training procedure of\nGPAM, we use contrastive learning loss to comprehensively consider the effects\nof range and margin on the classification of known and unknown classes to\nensure the model's stability and robustness. Sufficient experiments and\nablations on the FewRel dataset show that GPAM surpasses previous prototype\nmethods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

A learning policy may take actions beyond the behavior\npolicy's knowledge, referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) actions. The\nQ-values for these OOD actions can be easily overestimated. As a result, the\nlearning policy is biased by using incorrect Q-value estimates.

In this work, we propose Q-Distribution Guided Q-Learning (QDQ),\nwhich applies a pessimistic adjustment to Q-values in OOD regions based on\nuncertainty estimation. This uncertainty measure relies on the conditional\nQ-value distribution, learned through a high-fidelity and efficient consistency\nmodel. Additionally, to prevent overly conservative estimates, we introduce an\nuncertainty-aware optimization objective for updating the Q-value function. The\nproposed QDQ demonstrates solid theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of\nQ-value distribution learning and uncertainty measurement, as well as the\nperformance of the learning policy.

Our method achieves $1.1$-$1.5\\times$ improvement in training\nthroughput on popular DPO datasets, without any effect on convergence. When\ncombined with sequence packing, we observe consistent $1.3$-$1.6\\times$\nspeedups, benefiting even datasets with smaller sequence lengths. While we\nfocus on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), our approach is applicable to\nother paired preference tuning methods. By enhancing computational efficiency,\nour work contributes to making preference-based fine-tuning more accessible for\na wider range of applications and model sizes.

    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many\nfields, showing outstanding comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Despite\ntheir great potential, LLMs usually require dedicated pre-training and\nfine-tuning for domain-specific applications such as wireless networks. These\nadaptations can be extremely demanding for computational resources and\ndatasets, while most network devices have limited computation power, and there\nare a limited number of high-quality networking datasets. To this end, this\nwork explores LLM-enabled wireless networks from the prompt engineering\nperspective, i.e., designing prompts to guide LLMs to generate desired output\nwithout updating LLM parameters. Compared with other LLM-driven methods, prompt\nengineering can better align with the demands of wireless network devices,\ne.g., higher deployment flexibility, rapid response time, and lower\nrequirements on computation power. In particular, this work first introduces\nLLM fundamentals and compares different prompting techniques such as in-context\nlearning, chain-of-thought, and self-refinement. Then we propose two novel\nprompting schemes for network applications: iterative prompting for network\noptimization, and self-refined prompting for network prediction. The case\nstudies show that the proposed schemes can achieve comparable performance as\nconventional machine learning techniques, and our proposed prompting-based\nmethods avoid the complexity of dedicated model training and fine-tuning, which\nis one of the key bottlenecks of existing machine learning techniques.",

By addressing\nlimitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional bayesian\noptimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive\nbenchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o,\nClaude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, extending prior work and establishing\nSLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By\nintegrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the\nexploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration\ncapabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more\neffective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and\nregression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and\nachieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in\nbudget-constrained scenarios demonstrated competitive performance, indicating\nthat LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal\nresults.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nlanguage tasks, but they require high computing power and rely on static\nknowledge. To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nincorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive\nfine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices\noffer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning\ntasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on\ncentralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct\nconstraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this\ngap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight\nframework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates\nand retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating\nmechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based\nstrategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian\nOptimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge\ngraph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay\nconstraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work\nrepresents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable\ntiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in\nunlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Text detoxification, a variant of style transfer tasks, finds useful\napplications in online social media. This work presents a fine-tuning method\nthat only uses non-parallel data to turn large language models (LLM) into a\ndetoxification rewritter. We model the fine-tuning process as a Stackelberg\ngame between an LLM (leader) and a toxicity screener (follower), which is a\nbinary style classifier (toxic or non-toxic). The LLM aims to align its\npreference according to the screener and generate paraphases passing the\nscreening. The primary challenge of non-parallel data fine-tuning is incomplete\npreference. In the case of unsuccessful paraphrases, the classifier cannot\nestablish a preference between the input and paraphrase, as they belong to the\nsame toxic style. Hence, preference-alignment fine-tuning methods, such as\ndirect preference optimization (DPO), no longer apply. To address the challenge\nof incomplete preference, we propose Stackelberg response optimization (SRO),\nadapted from DPO, to enable the LLM to learn from the follower's response. The\ngist is that SRO decreases the likelihood of generating the paraphrase if it\nfails the follower's screening while performing DPO on the pair of the toxic\ninput and its paraphrase when the latter passes the screening. Experiments\nindicate that the SRO-fine-tunned LLM achieves satisfying performance\ncomparable to state-of-the-art models regarding style accuracy, content\nsimilarity, and fluency. The overall detoxification performance surpasses other\ncomputing methods and matches the human reference. Additional empirical\nevidence suggests that SRO is sensitive to the screener's feedback, and a\nslight perturbation leads to a significant performance drop.

In light of this trend, we explore the viability of adapting\nopen-source LLMs for usage in the Army domain in order to address their\nexisting lack of domain-specificity. Our investigations have resulted in the\ncreation of three distinct generations of TRACLM, a family of LLMs fine-tuned\nby The Research and Analysis Center (TRAC), Army Futures Command (AFC). Through\ncontinuous refinement of our training pipeline, each successive iteration of\nTRACLM displayed improved capabilities when applied to Army tasks and use\ncases. Furthermore, throughout our fine-tuning experiments, we recognized the\nneed for an evaluation framework that objectively quantifies the Army\ndomain-specific knowledge of LLMs. To address this, we developed MilBench, an\nextensible software framework that efficiently evaluates the Army knowledge of\na given LLM using tasks derived from doctrine and assessments. We share\npreliminary results, models, methods, and recommendations on the creation of\nTRACLM and MilBench.
