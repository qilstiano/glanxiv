    "abstract": "Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,\naims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic\nemotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for\nCER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static\nand dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,\nand text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,\nour approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image\nPretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene\nunderstanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)\nmodule that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a\nCompound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability\nAggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods\nto produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus\ntraining, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%\non Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via\nzero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches\ntrained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is\npublicly available.",

The spectral index values and the destruction of PAHs in the central\nsource, together with previously detected X-rays emission, suggest the presence\nof a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star\nformation ring, coincident with a molecular gas ring previously reported.

    "abstract": "We propose a quantum information framework to model the quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) as a composite quantum channel acting on a multi-qubit or multi-qutrit\ncolor-entangled system.

This construction\ncaptures energy loss, decoherence, and confinement dynamics in a unified open\nquantum system framework. We analyze the evolution of entanglement entropy and\npurity under this composite channel. Amplitude damping reduces entropy by\ndriving subsystems toward pure states, while decoherence increases mixedness.\nHadronization further modifies correlations via thermal projections weighted by\nhadron masses and freeze-out temperature ($T \\sim 156 \\,\\text{MeV}$). Numerical\nsimulations show monotonic entropy and purity loss, consistent with\nentanglement degradation and confinement. Our results support interpreting the\nQGP as a noisy quantum channel that progressively erases color entanglement.\nThis framework bridges quantum information theory and QCD, offering new\ninsights into hadronization and non-perturbative dynamics in heavy-ion\ncollisions.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,\nachieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and\nvideo generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of\n4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches\nper sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were\nconducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with\na fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a\ndetailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting\ntrade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the\npromise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting\nfuture work in non-autoregressive language generation.",

To\ncapture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have\nexplored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent\nspace, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether\nsuch reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer\nthat reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count.

We\nalso explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors\nin the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research\nobjectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated\n(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both\nan individual- and population-level.

This regional\ndifference in fiber disarray, irrespective of perturbation severity, aligns\nwith previous DT-MRI studies, highlighting the role of regional myocardial\nmechanics in the development of fiber disarray. Furthermore, cardiac\nperformance declined in the remodeled LVs, particularly in those with fibrosis\nand hypocontractility. These findings provide important insights into the\nstructural and functional consequences of HCM and offer a framework for future\ninvestigations into therapeutic interventions targeting cardiac remodeling.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates how to monitor access to Android zero-permission\nsensors which could cause privacy leakage to users. Moreover, monitoring such\nsensitive access allows security researchers to characterize potential sensor\nabuse patterns. Zero-permission sensors such as accelerometers have become an\nindispensable part of Android devices. The critical information they provide\nhas attracted extensive research investigating how data collectors could\ncapture more sensor data to enable both benign and exploitative applications.\nIn contrast, little work has explored how to enable data providers, such as end\nusers, to understand sensor usage. While existing methods such as static\nanalysis and hooking-based dynamic analysis face challenges of requiring\ncomplicated development chains, rooting privilege, and app-specific reverse\nengineering analysis, our work aims to bridge this gap by developing ARMOUR for\nuser-space runtime monitoring, leveraging the intrinsic sampling rate variation\nand convergence behaviors of Android. ARMOUR enables privacy-aware users to\neasily monitor how third-party apps use sensor data and support security\nresearchers to perform rapid app-agnostic sensor access analysis. Our\nevaluation with 1,448 commercial applications shows the effectiveness of ARMOUR\nin detecting sensor usage in obfuscated code and other conditions, and observes\nsalient sensor abuse patterns such as 50% of apps from seemingly\nsensor-independent categories accessing data of multiple zero-permission\nsensors.

This\nstudy uses measurements from the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), the\nJupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI), and the Juno\nMagnetometer (MAG) from the first 20 perijoves. On magnetic field lines\nassociated with the diffuse aurora, we consistently find small-scale magnetic\nfield fluctuations with amplitudes of up to 100 nT on time scales of seconds to\n1 minute. On magnetic field lines directly linked to the main emission, the\nelectron distribution is field-aligned, mostly broad-band in energy, and\naccompanied by large-scale magnetic field perturbations of several 100 nT on\ntime scales of tens of min (except one case). These large-scale perturbations\nare generally associated with quasistatic field-aligned electric currents.\nSmall-scale magnetic fields are not resolved over the main emission zone closer\nthan radial distances 4 Jovian radii due to the digitization limit of the\nmagnetometer. However, in all cases where Juno crosses the main auroral field\nlines beyond 4RJ, the digitization limit is significantly reduced and we detect\nsmall-scale magnetic field fluctuations of 2 nT to 10 nT consistent with a\nturbulent spectrum. Associated energy fluxes projected to Jupiter can exceed\n1000 mW/m2.

The lack of experimental\nconfirmation by direct detection experiments or collider searches has ruled out\ncanonical WIMP scenarios (masses $\\sim$ GeV-TeV), making a case for the largely\nunexplored sub-GeV frontier. This PhD thesis is focused on the evolution and\nlatest developments of TREX-DM, a gaseous Time Projection Chamber (TPC)\ndesigned to detect low-mass WIMPs through their low-energy nuclear recoils.\nTREX-DM is equipped with microbulk Micromegas readout planes, a technology\nwell-suited for rare event searches due to its intrinsic radiopurity, potential\nfor low energy thresholds and background discrimination capabilities through 3D\nevent reconstruction.\n  A central focus of the thesis is background reduction in TREX-DM: through\n222Rn mitigation and surface contamination control, background levels have been\nreduced from $\\sim$ 1000 to 80-100 dru. Surface contamination, primarily from\n222Rn progeny, has prompted the development of novel screening tools such as\nAlphaCAMM, a high-sensitivity surface contamination detector.\n  The most significant result is the implementation of a Gas Electron\nMultiplier (GEM) pre-amplification stage on top of the microbulk Micromegas\ndetectors. This yields extra gain factors up to $\\sim$ 100, substantially\nreducing the energy threshold. A calibration with a 37Ar source (low-energy\npeaks at 0.27 keV and 2.82 keV) validated this reduction, demonstrating energy\nthresholds at the level of single-ionisation energies (26 eV in argon).\n  Future improvements target further background reduction through a modified\ncathode design, enhanced detector stability via a more robust field cage, and\ngas mixture optimisation to enhance sensitivity to low-energy nuclear recoils.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we show our results with new interpretation on the critical\nexponents of thin films obtained by high-performance multi-histogram Monte\nCarlo simulations. The film thickness $N_z$ consists of a few layers up to a\ndozen of layers in the $z$ direction. The free boundary condition is applied in\nthis direction while in the $xy$ plane periodic boundary conditions are used.\nLarge $xy$ plane sizes are used for finite-size scaling. The Ising model is\nstudied with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. When $N_z=1$, namely the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) system, we find the critical exponents given by the\nrenormalization group. While, for $N_z>1$, the critical exponents calculated\nwith the high-precision multi-histogram technique show that they deviate\nslightly but systematically from the 2D values. If we use these values of\ncritical exponents in the hyperscaling relation with $d=2$, then the\nhyperscaling relation is violated. However, if we use the hyperscaling relation\nand the critical exponents obtained for $N_z>1$ to calculate the dimension of\nthe system, we find the system dimension slightly larger than 2. This can be\nviewed as an \"effective\" dimension. More discussion is given in the paper. We\nalso show the cross-over between the first- and second-order transition while\nvarying the film thickness in an antiferromagnetic FCC Ising frustrated thin\nfilm. In addition, we will show evidence that when a 2D system has two order\nparameters of different symmetries with a single transition, the critical\nexponents are new, suggesting a universality class of coupled two-symmetry\nbreakings. In this case, the 2D hyperscaling does not hold. Another case is the\n3D Ising model coupled to the lattice vibration: the critical exponents deviate\nfrom the 3D Ising ones, the results suggest the violation of the hyperscaling.",

SCM does not require that\npolling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\\% faster than\nPCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource\noverheads.

    "abstract": "Populations experience a complex interplay of continuous and discrete\nprocesses: continuous growth and interactions are punctuated by discrete\nreproduction events, dispersal, and external disturbances. These dynamics can\nbe modeled by impulsive or flow-kick systems, where continuous flows alternate\nwith instantaneous discrete changes. To study species persistence in these\nsystems, an invasion growth rate theory is developed for flow-kick models with\nstate-dependent timing of kicks and auxiliary variables. The invasion growth\nrates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of\nspecies when rare. Two theorems are proven to characterize permanence i.e. the\nextinction set is a repellor. The first theorem uses Morse decompositions of\nthe extinction set and requires that there exists a species with a positive\ninvasion growth rate for every invariant measure supported on a component of\nthe Morse decomposition. The second theorem uses invasion growth rates to\ndefine invasion graphs whose vertices correspond to communities and directed\nedges to potential invasions. Provided the invasion graph is acyclic,\npermanence is fully characterized by the signs of the invasion growth rates.\nInvasion growth rates are also used to identify the existence of\nextinction-bound trajectories and attractors that lie on the extinction set.\nThe results are illustrated with three applications: (i) a microbial serial\ntransfer model, (ii) a spatially structured consumer-resource model, and (iii)\nan empirically parameterized Lotka-Volterra model.

However, the physics underlying the spin\ntexture of disordered iron-oxide nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit\nremains still poorly understood. Using large-scale micromagnetic simulations we\ncompletely map the magnetization of NFs over an unprecedented size range, from\n10 to 400 nm in diameter, connecting their microstructure to their macroscopic\nmagnetic response. Above the single domain (d > 50 nm), the magnetization folds\ninto a vortex state, within which the coercivity describes a secondary maximum,\nnot present for non-disordered nanoparticles. We have extended our\nunderstanding by resolving also the NF magnetization dynamics, capturing the\nphysics of the magnetization reversal. Within the vortex regime, two distinct\nreversal modes exist: i) A core-dominated one, in which the core immediately\nswitches along the direction of the applied field, resulting in an increasing\ncoercivity for larger sizes; and ii) a flux-closure dominated reversal mode,\ngoing through the perpendicular alignment of the vortex core to the field,\nresulting in a decreasing coercivity-size dependence. The coercivity maximum is\nlocated at the transition between both reversal modes, and results from the\ncombination of grain anisotropy and grain-boundary pinning: weak (but\nnon-negligible) inter-grain exchange keeps the vortex profile coherent, yet\nallows the core to be pinned by the random anisotropy easy axes of the single\ngrains, maximizing magnetic losses. Our results provide the first full\ndescription of spin textures in iron oxide NFs beyond the macrospin framework,\nand clarify the role of internal spin disorder in magnetic hyperthermia\nheating. By adjusting the grain size, the coercivity \"sweet spot\" can be\ntailored, offering a practical route to next-generation, high-efficiency\nnanoheaters.",

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce\ninterventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that\nfurther reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.",

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising\nframework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes\napplications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,\nneglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in\ngraph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the\nfundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction\nmethods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this\npaper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework\ntailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to\ndynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by\ntemporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based\nnon-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties\nwithin evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware\noptimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,\nenhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,\nDBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to\nensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction\nin prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Timely up- or down-regulation of gene expression is crucial for cellular\ndifferentiation and function. While gene upregulation via transcriptional\nactivators has been extensively investigated, gene silencing remains\nunderstudied, especially by modelling. This study employs 3D simulations to\nstudy the biophysics of a chromatin fibre where active transcription factors\ncompete with repressors for binding to transcription units along the fibre, and\ninvestigates how different silencing mechanisms affect 3D chromatin structure\nand transcription. We examine three gene silencing feedback mechanisms:\npositive, negative, and neutral. These mechanisms capture different silencing\npathways observed or proposed in biological systems. Our findings reveal that,\nwhilst all mechanisms lead to a silencing transition, the signatures of this\ntransition depend on the choice of the feedback. The latter controls the\nmorphologies of the emergent 3D transcription factor clusters, the average gene\nexpression and its variability, or gene noise, and the network of ensuing\ncorrelations between activities of neighbouring transcription units. These\nresults provide insights into the biophysics of gene silencing, as well as into\nthe interplay between transcriptional regulation and 3D genome organisation.",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation has recently progressed beyond ordinal depth to\nprovide metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater\nenvironments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color\ndistortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground truth data.\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned\nmonocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with\nmetric depth annotations, including FLSea and SQUID. We evaluated a diverse set\nof state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Models across a range of underwater\nconditions and depth ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained\non terrestrial data (real or synthetic) are effective in in-air settings, but\nperform poorly underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we\nfine-tune Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic\nunderwater variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we simulated using a\nphysically based underwater image formation model. Our fine-tuned model\nconsistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms\nbaselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. This study\npresents a detailed evaluation and visualization of monocular metric depth\nestimation in underwater scenes, emphasizing the importance of domain\nadaptation and scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable\nmetric depth predictions using foundation models in challenging environments.",

The [C II] features recently identified as the [C II] Shell is\nshown to be part of the Veil-B HI foreground layer. Jointly called the Outer\nShell, it covers the bright Huygens Region and the Extended Orion Nebula. Its\nmaximum expansion velocity is 15 km/s. Closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a\nsecond expanding shell, called the Inner Shell. It has an expansion velocity of\n27 km/s and probably results from a more recent period of strong wind from one\nor more of the Trapezium stars. Even closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a\ncentral high ionization bubble, freely expanding towards the observer but\nslowed in the opposite direction by photo-ionized gas coming off the Main\nIonization Front. Utilization of spectroscopic measures of the equivalent width\nof Hbeta shows that the enhanced emission in [C II] seen just outside the\nvisual wavelength boundaries of the Orion Nebula is not caused by\nlimb-brightening of the Outer Shell. This enhanced emission is due to the\nradiation field of the Trapezium stars being filtered by intervening residual\nneutral hydrogen. A velocity component near 30 km/s (Heliocentric) first seen\nin HI is also present in [C II] and may result from a foreground cloud of the\nISM.",

Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather\nelusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the\nquasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating\nastrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and\nidentified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514.\nWe assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary\nsystems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and\napplied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward\ncoalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the\ndiscovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW\nemission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an\nad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of\nJ2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters\nconsistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514\nenabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital\nevolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future\ndetections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in\nradio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a\nfuture physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we\napply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for\naiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a\nsynergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving\nprospective GW facilities.",

Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization\ntasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically\nLong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and\nDeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent\nabstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive\nand systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning\nLLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented\ndialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary\nlengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and\nadvanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and\nhuman-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,\nour findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently\nimprove dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone\nto verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to\ntheir non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and\ndetailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may\nfail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our\nwork provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and\nhighlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for\nreal-world dialogue summarization.",

This work introduces Tangma, a new activation function\nthat combines the smooth shape of the hyperbolic tangent with two learnable\nparameters: $\\alpha$, which shifts the curve's inflection point to adjust\nneuron activation, and $\\gamma$, which adds linearity to preserve weak\ngradients and improve training stability. Tangma was evaluated on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 using custom networks composed of convolutional and linear layers, and\ncompared against ReLU, Swish, and GELU. On MNIST, Tangma achieved the highest\nvalidation accuracy of 99.09% and the lowest validation loss, demonstrating\nfaster and more stable convergence than the baselines. On CIFAR-10, Tangma\nreached a top validation accuracy of 78.15%, outperforming all other activation\nfunctions while maintaining a competitive training loss. Tangma also showed\nimproved training efficiency, with lower average epoch runtimes compared to\nSwish and GELU. These results suggest that Tangma performs well on standard\nvision tasks and enables reliable, efficient training. Its learnable design\ngives more control over activation behavior, which may benefit larger models in\ntasks such as image recognition or language modeling.",

A\ngame-theoretic performance metric, the modified Price of Anarchy, is introduced\nand is used in a generalizable partitioning metric to quantify optimality\nlosses in a distributed controller. By finding the partition that minimizes the\npartitioning metric, the best-performing distributed control design is chosen.\nThe presented partitioning metric is control-design agnostic, making it broadly\napplicable to many control design problems. In this paper, the developed metric\nis used to minimize the performance losses in the distributed control of a\ndemand-flexible District Heating Network. The final distributed controller is\nprovably feasible and stable. In simulation, this novel partitioning performed\nsimilarly to the centralized controller, increasing overall heat losses by only\n1.9%, as compared to a similarly-sized baseline partition, which resulted in a\n22% increase in losses.",

The high luminosity, short duration, and high\ndispersion measure of these events suggest they result from extreme,\nhigh-energy extragalactic sources, such as highly magnetized and rapidly\nspinning neutron stars known as magnetars. The number of detected FRBs,\nincluding repeating ones, has grown rapidly in recent years. Except for FRB\n20200428D, and FRB-like radio burst that is associated to Galactic magnetar SGR\n1935+2154, no multi-wavelength counterpart to any FRB has been detected yet.\nThe High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope has developed a\n{program} to follow up FRBs searching for their gamma-ray counterparts, helping\nto uncover the nature of FRBs and FRB sources. This paper provides an overview\nof the searches for FRB sources conducted by H.E.S.S., including follow-up\nobservations and simultaneous multi-wavelength campaigns with radio and X-ray\nobservatories.

The observed\nstructure is consistent with the lowest excited $P$-wave $B_{c}^{+}$ states and\nexhibits a statistical significance exceeding seven standard deviations\nrelative to the background-only hypothesis. A two-peak model serves as an\neffective description of the data, with various theory-constrained models\nfurther explored to provide physical interpretation. Based on the predictions\nfor the $B_{c}(1P)^{+}$ spectrum, the relative production cross-section of the\noverall $B_{c}(1P)^{+}$ states with respect to the $B_{c}^{+}$ ground state\nwith the transverse momentum $p_{\\text{T}}$ and rapidity $y$ of $B_{c}^{+}$\nmesons in the regions $p_{\\text{T}}<20~\\mathrm{Ge\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c$ and\n$2.0<y<4.5$ at $\\sqrt{s}=13~\\text{TeV}$ is measured to be $0.20 \\pm 0.03 \\pm\n0.02 \\pm 0.03$, where the uncertainty terms represent statistical, systematic,\nand uncertainties related to the choice of theoretical models, respectively.\nThe results provide a test of theoretical models and deepen our understanding\nof quantum chromodynamics.",

It is\nwell-known that when a rumor process is embedded in these networks, the system\nexhibits a transition between localization and propagation at a finite value of\nthe network mean degree, emphasizing the importance of incorporating shortcuts\nto optimize the dissemination process. We adopt a complementary approach by\nexamining the rumor process exclusively within the context of the ring lattice.\nOur objective is to determine the optimal value of $k$ as a function of $n$ to\nmaximize the dissemination of the rumor. We assume that the lattice is\nsubdivided into three classes of agents: ignorants, spreaders, and stiflers. A\nspreader transmits the rumor to any of its ignorant neighbors at rate one. At\nthe same rate, a spreader transitions to a stifler after contact with other\nspreaders or stiflers. The rumor model is a continuous-time Markov chain, which\ncan be used to model the state of each node at any given time. Following an\nanalysis of contrasting examples, and an examination of the general case\nthrough a numerical approach, we demonstrate that, even in the absence of\nshortcuts, the model can exhibit a behavior concerning the proportion of nodes\nreached by the information that is analogous to that observed in homogeneously\nmixed populations. This is observed provided $k=k(n)$ is of the order of $\\log\nn$.",

Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a\nlow-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from\nparticular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two\napproaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two\napproaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by\ncycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the\nentire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)\nand partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,\npotentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The\nsecond approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic\nsignals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure.

In\nthis work, we use the presence of refraction effects to test whether exoplanets\nabove the period-radius valley have H/He atmospheres, which high levels of\nstellar radiation could evaporate away, in turn leaving rocky cores below the\nvalley. We find strong observational evidence of refraction effects for\nexoplanets above the period-radius valley based on Kepler photometry, however\nthose related to optically thin H/He atmospheres are not common in the observed\nplanetary population. This result may be attributed to signal dampening caused\nby clouds and hazes, consistent with the optically thick and intrinsically\nhotter atmospheres of Kepler exoplanets caused by relatively close host star\nproximity.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting\nreliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental\nlimitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years\nhave seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic\nstrategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the\nfundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain\nworld. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial\nintelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both\nacademic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI\ntechniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic\nreputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We\nobserve that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,\nsource selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on\nunverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI\nshould be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within\na broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.",

    "abstract": "In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with\ntargeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each\nrequiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of\nself-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably\ndesigned building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it\nis still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks\nthat lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as\ntarget structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building\nblocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is\ndefined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy\nis implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain\nour originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly\nevaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine\nlearning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our\ndesign space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs\nare identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations\nwith the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific,\nexperimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that\nself-assembly into the target phase.

The structure of\natomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role\nat this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the\ncharacterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most\neffective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K)\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically\nfabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon\ndangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface.

By performing dI/dV line\nspectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and\ndemonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization\nand induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy\ndensity functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to\ncompute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising\nwire geometries.

Moreover, the problem can have other convex nonlinear parts, that\ncannot be handled by these approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative\napproach for polynomial optimization.

With\nlearning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the\nnormalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss\ncurves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse.

We\nfind the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the\nupstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole\nin the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we\ndeduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A\nkey issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent\nor only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous\nresults. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency\n(well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid\nelectron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley\nscattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result,\ninterference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of\ndisorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to\ninterface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic\nfield.

The numerical\nsurveys use the DROP code updated with a modified polytropic equation-of-state\n(EOS) and investigate flattening parameters $f$ up to $0.2$. In the mass range\n$0.1 M_\\oplus < M < 10 M_\\oplus$, we find that rotation systematically shifts\nthe curves of composition towards larger radii and/or smaller masses. Relative\nto the spherical case, the equatorial radius $R_{eq}$ is increased by about\n$0.36f$ for single-layer planets, and by $0.30f$ to $0.55f$ for two-layer\nplanets (depending on the core size fraction $q$ and planet mass $M$). Rotation\nis an additional source of confusion in deriving planetary structures, as the\nradius alterations are of the same order as i) current observational\nuncertainties for super-Earths, and ii) EOS variations. We have established a\nmultivariate fit of the form $R_{eq}(M,f,q)$, which enables a fast\ncharacterization of the core size and rotational state of rocky planets and\nocean worlds. We discuss how the observational data must be shifted in the\ndiagrams to self-consistently account for an eventual planet spin, depending on\nthe geometry of the transit (circular/oblate). A simple application to the\nrecently characterized super-Earth candidate LHS1140b is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Predicting a mobile app's popularity before its first release can provide\ndevelopers with a strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it\nremains a challenging problem. This study explores the extent to which internal\nsoftware metrics, measurable from source code before deployment, can predict an\napp's popularity (i.e., ratings and downloads per year) at inception. For our\nanalysis, we constructed a rigorously filtered dataset of 446 open-source\nJava-based Android apps that are available on both F-Droid and Google Play\nStore. Using app source code from F-Droid, we extracted a wide array of\ninternal metrics, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,\ncode smells, and app metadata. Popularity-related information, including\nreviews and download counts, was collected from the Play Store.\n  We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a\nminimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set\nderived via feature selection algorithms. Our results show that, for both app\nratings and number of downloads, regression models perform poorly due to skewed\nrating distributions and a highly scattered range of download counts in our\ndataset. However, when reframed as a binary classification (Popular vs.\nUnpopular), performance improves significantly-the best model, a Multilayer\nPerceptron, achieves an F1-score of 0.72.\n  We conclude that, although internal code metrics alone are insufficient for\naccurately predicting an app's future popularity, they do exhibit meaningful\ncorrelations with it. Thus, our findings challenge prior studies that have\nentirely dismissed internal metrics as valid indicators of software quality.\nInstead, our results align with research suggesting that internal code metrics\ncan be valuable when evaluated within the appropriate context-specifically, we\nfound them useful for classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,\nlearn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most\ncommonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and\nwidely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code\nsearch tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic\nstructure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to\nsystematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools\noperate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be\ndifficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural\nlanguage to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural\nlanguage provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to\nentry.\n  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning\ncapabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the\npower of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve\nrelevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search\nDSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for\nstructural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show\nthat our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to\nDSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision\nand recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly\noutperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to\n57% and 14% on F1 scores.",

This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of\n40 massive ($\\log\\left(M_{\\rm 200, crit}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\right) > 14.5$) TNG300\nclusters at $z \\approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then\nperforming identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images.\nImportantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking\nprocedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases\nintroduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the\n`smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended\nin TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction\nrelative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light\ndimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the\nexcess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the\nhalf-light radius ($2 r_{\\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed\ncircular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median\n$f_{\\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the\nobservations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\\rm ICL}$, which we attribute\nprimarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather\nthan `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find\nthat most methods yield median $f_{\\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is\nconsistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\\rm half}$.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing electromagnetic fields in complex, multi-material environments\npresents substantial computational challenges. To address these, we propose a\nhybrid numerical method that couples discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with\nsurface integral equations (SIE) in the potential-based formulation of\nMaxwell's equations. The method employs the magnetic vector and electric scalar\npotentials ($\\mathbf{A}$-$\\Phi$) under the Lorenz gauge, offering natural\ncompatibility with multi-physics couplings and inherent immunity to\nlow-frequency breakdown. To effectively handle both bounded and unbounded\nregions, we divide the computational domain: the inhomogeneous interior is\ndiscretized using DEC, a coordinate-free framework that preserves topological\ninvariants and enables structure-preserving discretization on unstructured\nmeshes, while the homogeneous exterior is treated using SIEs, which inherently\nsatisfy the radiation condition and eliminate the need for artificial domain\ntruncation. A key contribution of this work is a scalar reformulation of the\nSIEs, which reduces the number of surface integral operators from fourteen to\ntwo by expressing the problem in terms of the Cartesian components of the\nvector potential and their normal derivatives. This simplification motivates a\ncorresponding adaptation in the DEC domain: each vector potential component is\nrepresented as a discrete 0-form, in contrast to the conventional 1-form\nrepresentation. This novel treatment improves compatibility at the interface\nand significantly enhances numerical performance. The proposed hybrid method\nthus offers a unified, efficient, and physically consistent framework for\nsolving electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems in complex geometries\nand heterogeneous materials",

This perspective paper investigates how\nsuch LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of\nrecommender systems.\n  We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a\ntuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii)\ncaptures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment,\nand communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end\nuse cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline\nevaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation\ngeneration-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic\norchestration.\n  We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity,\nscalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment\n(including covert collusion), and brand compliance.\n  For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and\noutline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda:\na blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be\ncomposed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the\nRecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance\ntools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic\nabstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the\nnext generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation\nservices.",

While spin angular momentum (SAM) effects in MO systems are\nwell-established, orbital angular momentum (OAM) introduces novel opportunities\nfor new nonreciprocal light-matter interactions. In this study, we demonstrate\na unique optical phenomenon where OAM states undergo state-specific\nnonreciprocal operation within an MO medium, reducing Faraday rotation. This\neffect arises from transverse momentum transfer into the material, inducing\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) at a perturbed electronic transition rate. The\nresulting OAM-dependent optical SOC modifies the material's refractive index,\ndirectly linking structured light and MO response. Our findings extend previous\nobservations of paraxial beams and reveal a deeper fundamental mechanism\ngoverning OAM-driven nonreciprocal interactions.

However, most\nexisting approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific\n(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like\nmath and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of\nunsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this\npaper, we ask the question \"Is it possible to generalize these System 2\nThinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from\nunsupervised learning?\" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning\nto explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and\ncandidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization\nwith respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models\non most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,\nsuggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,\nEBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking\ncapabilities of models.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and scalable surrogate models for AC power flow are essential for\nreal-time grid monitoring, contingency analysis, and decision support in\nincreasingly dynamic and inverter-dominated power systems. However, most\nexisting surrogates fall short of practical deployment due to their limited\ncapacity to capture long-range nonlinear dependencies in meshed transmission\nnetworks and their weak enforcement of physical laws. These models often\nrequire extensive hyperparameter tuning, exhibit poor generalization under\ntopology changes or large load swings, and typically do not quantify\nuncertainty or scale well beyond a few hundred buses. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a \\textit{gated graph neural network (GGNN)}\nsurrogate for AC power-flow estimation under topological uncertainty. The model\nis trained across multiple IEEE benchmark networks of varying size and\ncomplexity, each incorporating randomized line contingencies and up to 40\\%\nload variation. To improve robustness and generalization, we explore both\nconventional supervised learning and physics-informed self-supervised training\nstrategies. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed GGNN consistently\noutperforms prior GNN-based surrogates, achieving predictions closely aligned\nwith Newton--Raphson solutions. By embedding operational constraints directly\ninto the architecture and loss function, the model ensures physical consistency\nand delivers a lightweight, accurate, and scalable tool for real-time grid\noperations.",

During diastole,\na sluggish removal of ${\\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere\nrelaxation, leading to ILVR \\textit{at the organ level}.

To\naddress this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving\nstatistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and\nfeature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select\nthe most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were\nobtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model\nexhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG).\nBy iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the\nselected reduced features.

The confusion\nmatrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable\nperformance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach,\nwhile offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant\nfeatures.

The residual\nsymmetry on a timelike hypersurface of constant scalar field is referred to as\nthe $(2+1)$d diffeomorphism invariance.

Although grid and place cells\nboth encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why\nanimals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place\nrepresentations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated\ntasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals\nmaintain grid and place representations together to support planning.\nSpecifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory\ninformation relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall\nof goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting\nsubsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous\ntheoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local\ntransition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further\nshow that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward\nthe goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place\ncell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We\ndemonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously\nmodels the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent\nmechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place\nsystem, make several characteristic, testable predictions.",

Next we determine the ranges of mass (from a\nfraction of eV all the way to the Planck scale) and lifetime of the source\nparticles along which we do not/we do expect that the sharp spectral feature\nwill be altered by interactions of the neutrinos on their way to the detector,\nmainly with the cosmic neutrino background or between themselves. We also study\nthe theoretical (i.e. mainly BBN and CMB) and observational constraints which\nhold on such a possibility. This allows us to delineate the regions of\nparameter space (mass, lifetime and abundance) that are already excluded,\nhopeless for future observation or, instead, which could lead to the\nobservation of such neutrinos in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Most of the visible mass in a typical spiral galaxy is distributed in a thin\ndisk, with a radial extent much larger than its thickness. While the planar\ndisk structure, including non-axisymmetric features such as spiral structure,\nhas been studied extensively, the vertical structure has not received\ncomparable attention. This review aims to give a comprehensive, pedagogic\nintroduction to the rich topic of vertical structure of a galactic disk in\nhydrostatic equilibrium and discuss the theoretical developments in this field\nin the context of recent observations. A realistic multi-component disk plus\nhalo model of a galaxy has been developed and studied by us in detail. This\ntakes account of both stars and interstellar gas, treated as isothermal\ncomponents with different velocity dispersions, which are gravitationally\ncoupled; further, the disk is in the gravitational field of the dark matter\nhalo. This review focuses on this model and the results from it in different\nphysical cases.\n  The gas and halo crucially affect the resulting self-consistent stellar\ndistribution such that it is vertically constrained to be closer to the\nmid-plane and has a steeper profile than in the standard one-component case, in\nagreement with modern observations. A typical stellar disk is shown to flare by\na factor of few within the visible radial extent of the disk. These robust\nresults question the sech^2 profile and a constant scale height, routinely used\nin the literature, for convenience. In an important application, the observed\nHI gas scale height is used as a constraint on the model which helps determine\nthe shape and the density profile of the dark matter halo for galaxies.\nFinally, we outline some key, open questions which can be addressed in the near\nfuture using the above model, and new observational data -- for example, from\nIFU surveys and JWST -- for a better understanding of this topic.",

Our\nfirst-principles studies for two-dimensional PbBr$_4$-based chiral perovskites\nprovide their electronic structure and an orbital-based symmetry analysis,\nwhich allows us to establish an effective Hamiltonian to elucidate the\nunderlying origin of their chirality. We also use this analysis for the\nEdelstein effect, responsible for electrical generation of the nonequilibrium\nspin polarization in many materials, which in chiral perovskites could be a\nmechanism contributing to CISS.

We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the\nHellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function.\nOur study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year\ndataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of\nthe SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the\ngraviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the\npossibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data.

Despite this, their\nrole in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid\ngrowth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains\npoorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological\nsimulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\\odot$ black hole seeds with\ntheir host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from\nno AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups\nincluding non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across\nall our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of\n$\\sim10^7 M_\\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth\nhistories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The\nsimulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with\nsuper-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding\n2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression\nin the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate\nluminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black\nholes, dynamical masses of $\\sim10^{9.5} M_\\odot$, and high, though\nshort-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a\nscenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the\nreionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic\nmedium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.",

There, the dynamical corotation torque is\nthought to play an important role by slowing down type I migration. We aim to\nprovide a simple analytical prescription for the dynamical corotation torque\nfor use in 1D global models of planet formation and evolution, and assess the\nimportance of the dynamical corotation torque for the migration of low-mass\nplanets in low-viscosity discs. We propose simple prescriptions for calculating\nin 1D the time evolution of the vortensities of the librating and\norbit-crossing flows around a low-mass planet, which both enter the analytical\nexpression for the dynamical corotation torque. One of our prescriptions\ninvolves a memory timescale for the librating flow, and 2D hydrodynamical\nsimulations of disc-planet interactions are used to assess the memory timescale\nand validate our model. The orbital evolution of a low-mass planet is\ncalculated by 1D simulations where the dynamical corotation torque features our\nprescriptions for the vortensities of the librating and orbit-crossing flows,\nand by 2D hydrodynamical simulations of disc-planet interactions, assuming\nlocally isothermal discs. We find very good agreement between the 1D and 2D\nsimulations for a wide parameter space, whether the dynamical corotation torque\nslows down or accelerates inward migration. We provide maps showing how much\nthe dynamical corotation torque reduces the classical type I migration torque\nas a function of planet mass and orbital distance. The reduction is about 50\\%\nfor a 10 Earth-mass planet at 10 au in a young disc with surface density\nprofile in $r^{-1/2}$ and alpha viscosity of $10^{-4}$. In discs with low\nturbulent viscosity, the dynamical corotation torque should be taken into\naccount in global models as it can strongly slow down type I migration.",

    "abstract": "We performed a systematic analysis of how the orbital configuration of a\nmerger can influence the structural formation of remnant galaxies using 531\nmerger pairs selected from IllustrisTNG-100. We comprehensively described the\nmerger orbital configuration, considering the relative orbital motion of the\nmerger pair and their disk orientations. We quantified the galaxy structures by\ndynamically defining four components: bulge, disk, warm component, and hot\ninner stellar halo. For mergers on spiral-in orbits, the disk planes of the two\nmerging galaxies tend to be aligned with the orbital plane, leading to higher\nfractions for the disk and warm components, as well as lower fractions for the\nbulge and hot inner stellar halo components in the remnant galaxy. For mergers\non direct collision orbits, the disk planes of the two galaxies tend to be\nperpendicular to the orbital plane, leading to lower fractions for disk and\nwarm components, as well as higher fractions of the bulge and hot inner stellar\nhalo in the remnant. Mergers can lead to either an increase or decrease in the\ndisk and bulge mass fraction in the remnant compared to the progenitor galaxy,\ndepending on the merger orbital configurations; however, in 93% of cases,\nmergers cause an increase in the hot inner stellar halo. As a result, the\nluminosity fraction of the hot inner stellar halo (but not the bulge) in\ngalaxies at $z=0$ is highly correlated with its total ex situ stellar mass. In\naddition, we find that merger on spiral-in orbits is one of the possible\nreasons for the formation of recently discovered red but HI-rich (RR) galaxies.",

Here, we introduce a novel technique, frame-normalized\nprincipal component analysis (FN-PCA) to analyze and detrend these MIRI\ntime-series observations. Using the FN-PCA technique, we perform a uniform\nreanalysis of the published MIRI 15 micron observations of LHS 1478 b, TOI-1468\nb, LHS 1140 c, TRAPPIST-1 b, and TRAPPIST-1 c using our new data reduction\npipeline (Erebus) and compare them to different potential atmospheric and\nsurface compositions. We also investigate additional public data sets with the\nsole purpose of understanding the instrument systematics affecting MIRI. We\nidentify and categorize important detector-level systematics in the\nobservations that are generally present across all 17 analyzed eclipse\nobservations, which we illustrate as eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs in the FN-PCA.\nOne of these eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs corresponds to the prominent ramp\neffect at the beginning of the time-series observations which has widely been\nreported for JWST and Spitzer photometry. For JWST/MIRI, we show that the\ndetector settling time scales exponentially with the apparent magnitude of the\ntarget star $T_\\mathrm{set} \\mathrm{[hours]} = 0.063\\exp^{0.427\\cdot m_K}\n-0.657$.

Current constraints\non the scalar power spectrum at these scales are either weak or rely heavily on\nmodel-dependent assumptions about small-scale structure. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to probe the small-scale primordial power spectrum using\nscalar-induced tensor perturbations, which are inevitably sourced by curvature\nperturbations at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While\ninduced tensor modes have traditionally been studied in the context of the\nstochastic gravitational wave background, we highlight a complementary\nobservable: the distinctive pattern of B-mode polarization they imprint on the\nCMB. We compute the angular spectrum of these B-modes arising from enhanced\nscalar perturbations and show that the resulting signal can be competitive with\ninflationary predictions for values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio targeted in\nupcoming CMB experiments, most notably CMB-Stage 4.

Area-metric gravity\ncontains the well-known length-metric degrees of freedom of standard gravity as\nwell as additional shape-mismatching degrees of freedom. To be\nphenomenologically viable, the shape-mismatching degrees of freedom have to\ndecouple under the renormalization group flow towards lower scales. We test\nthis scenario by calculating the renormalization group flow of the masses and\nfind that these are in general even more relevant than dictated by their\ncanonical scaling dimension. This generically results in masses which are large\ncompared to the Planck mass and thereby ensure the decoupling of\nshape-mismatching degrees of freedom. In addition, the latter come in a\nleft-handed and right-handed sector. We find that parity symmetry does not\nemerge under the renormalization group flow. Finally, we extract the\nrenormalization group flow of the Immirzi parameter from this setup and find\nthat its beta function features zeros at vanishing as well as at infinite\nImmirzi parameter.",

Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by\nspacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological\n(SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal\nsymmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To\nthis end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the\nenriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and\ndetecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D\nsymmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly\nconstruct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice\ntranslations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations,\nthe interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations\npermuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a\nfoliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between\nLieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify\nmodulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases.

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of flux compactifications on non-supersymmetric\nRiemann-flat manifolds (RFM's) with Casimir energy. While curvature and other\ncorrections are suppressed in RFM's, the inclusion of Casimir energies allows\none to evade standard dS no-go theorems, and the absence of orientifolds or\nother singular sources means that the construction is completely captured by\nten or eleven-dimensional supergravity. We obtain a fully explicit formula for\nthe Casimir stress-energy in a general RFM, including its ten or\neleven-dimensional profile. The Casimir energy localizes in particular loci of\nthe RFM, which we call \"Casimir branes\". The tension of Casimir branes\nsometimes cancels exactly, due to a spacetime analog of worldsheet Atkin-Lehner\nsymmetry. We use Casimir energies to construct an explicit $dS_5$ maximum\nsolution of a flux compactification of M-theory on a specific 6-dimensional\nRFM. The resulting solution is scale-separated, has a vacuum energy of\n$10^{-15}$ in five-dimensional Planck units, the Hubble radius is $10^7$ Planck\nlengths, and the light fields have masses of order $H^2$. This is a fully\nexplicit, top-down de Sitter maximum in M-theory, with precisely computable\nvacuum energy. While the solution is not parametric, it is under extraordinary\ncontrol: higher derivative and loop corrections to the vacuum energy are\nsuppressed in powers of a small parameter $\\delta V/V\\sim 10^{-10}$, and M2 and\nM5-brane instantons are negligible. In short, the solution survives all known\ncorrections. Nevertheless, it might be sensitive to more exotic ones, such as\ne.g. loops of 11d Planckian virtual black holes if there were a large enough\nnumber of them. We also extend the Ewald numerical method for lattice sums to\narbitrary dimensions and develop an efficient numerical implementation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling\nlanguage-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating\ntwo key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical\ninterpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images\nby modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and\nensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We\nfurther introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention\nmodules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent\ntransitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.",

    "abstract": "We present the first optical-UV spectral systematic analysis of 30 Type 1 AGN\nselected in the FIR and X-ray in the Lockman-SpReSO Survey. The sample of faint\nobjects (m_B = 19.6-21.8) covers a large redshift range of 0.33 > z > 4.97 with\nhigh S/N (~21 on average). A detailed spectral analysis based on the Quasar\nMain Sequence phenomenology prescription was applied to deblend the principal\noptical-UV emitting regions. Our sample spans a bolometric luminosity range of\n44.85 < log Lbol < 47.87, absolute B-magnitude -20.46 > M_B > -26.14, BH mass\nof 7.59 < log MBH < 9.80, and Eddington ratio -1.70 < log REdd < 0.56. The\nanalysis shows that 18 high-z objects correspond to Population B, whereas three\nlow-z fall in Populations A2, B1, and B1+. The remaining eight are candidates\nto be Pop. B and one Pop. A object. None of them are extreme accretors. We\nlooked for tendencies in our sample and compared them with other samples with\ndifferent selection criteria. Evidence for winds was explored using CIV1549\nline half-height centroid cmed finding wind velocities between 941 and -1587\nkms-1. This result is consistent with samples with similar ranges of z and M_B.\nThe Baldwin effect showed a slope of -0.23 pm 0.03 dex consistent with previous\nstudies. Spectra from twelve objects in our sample were found in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 17 database.

    "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,\ninformation-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital\nlandscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and\nalignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct\nabnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,\nwe conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly\ncompetitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop\nand release the \\textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world\nshort-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.",

A common approach to understanding these systems is to\nmodel the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between\nthem. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the\nsubsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the\ndirectionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between\nsubsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically\nlinear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by\nnonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven\nnonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions\nvia the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning\nJacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning\nmethod that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for\narbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs\noutperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,\nincluding high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we\nshow that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area\nover learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the\ntrained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior.

Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both\nshort-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the\neffectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color\nconsistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

We infer a\nrecent peak of star formation that may have led to the formation of the UDG\nthrough feedback-driven expansion.

In this work, we numerically investigate the role of disorder in\norbital transport within mesoscopic devices using a real-space tight-binding\nmodel on a two-dimensional square lattice that hosts atomic orbitals capable of\ncarrying atomic orbital angular momentum. By considering devices with varying\ngeometries--square and rectangular--and systematically tuning disorder\nstrength, we examine the disorder effect on orbital Hall current (OHC)\ngeneration, and orbital relaxation. Our results reveal a strong dependence of\nthe OHC and orbital Hall angle on disorder strength. In square devices, we\ndemonstrate that the orbital Hall response can be strongly enhanced by disorder\nand its dependence on the disorder strength indicates the dominance of\nskew-scattering mechanism in the diffusive regime. In rectangular geometries,\nthe orbital current decays exponentially with increasing device width, from\nwhich the orbital relaxation length is extracted.

By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets\nimproves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and\nchemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and\nprecision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.\nAdditionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities\noffer potential for anomaly detection.

This,\nalong with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a\ncloser examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we\nbegin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet\nmost complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or\nsuspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the\narguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings\ntie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand\nthe context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,\nif an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to\nknow what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and\ncoherence are secondary to effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision\ntasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the\nmainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have\nbecome increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model\narchitectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple\nevent-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently\nprocess patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between\nconsecutive frames as \"events\". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,\nevMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image\ndata (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance\nby avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification\nexperiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.\nMore significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate\nthat evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update\nmechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven\nbaseline.

    "abstract": "Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,\naims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

Alternatively, hybrid models based on\npiecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise\nfor capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to\nspecialized mathematical communities.

We detail the algorithm\nfor a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and\nprove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we\nuse the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights\nthe fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained\nby transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies\nthat may emerge from interactions between genes.",

The\nYOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared\nerror (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in\ndormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree\ngeometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square\nerrors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and\n13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal\nregistration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,\ncomprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the\ngrowing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to\naccess otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of\npruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray\nfield distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a\nsuitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field\nvalues. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to\ndetermine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at\nthe sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF)\nand is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The\nproperties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the\ndetection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its\nvalidity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence\nthe TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a\nnitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable\ndiscrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the\ninfluence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM\nmeasurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed\ndifferences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the\nclassical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing\nor suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of\nthe spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality\nreconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more\ncritical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the\nreference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space\nreconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.",

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of\ndetailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose\nmapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR\ntools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and\ndosimetric accuracies.",

Additionally, current datasets provide limited\nsupport for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.\nArchitecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail\nextraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we\npropose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and\nevaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with\nReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit\nhypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K\nsamples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and\nStory reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nfor editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,\nincorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture\ndetailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction\nreasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal\nEnhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and\nMLLM-derived features.

We measure forward-backward chiral-sensitive delays of up\nto 120 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionisation delays up to 240 as, which\ninclude an asymmmetry of $\\sim$60 as originating from chirality in the\ncontinuum-continuum transitions.

Our results reveal that the entire\nprocess is governed by the dynamic evolution of photospheric magnetic\nfootpoints, which proceeds in two distinct stages. An initial separating motion\nof the footpoints corresponds to a mild reconnection phase, characterized by a\nshort current sheet and the eruption of a cool H$\\alpha$ jet. Subsequently, a\nconverging motion of the footpoints triggers an intense reconnection phase.\nDuring this intense stage, the current sheet rapidly elongates, and the\nresulting decrease in its aspect ratio initiates a tearing-mode instability,\nforming a plasmoid. The appearance of this plasmoid mediates the onset of fast\nmagnetic reconnection, which produces a hot EUV jet and is concurrent with\nsignificant magnetic flux cancellation. We interpret this cancellation as the\nsubmergence of newly formed, post-reconnection loops. Furthermore, we identify\na distinct, high-temperature plasma blob in the jet spire, significantly hotter\nthan the surrounding jet plasma. We attribute this feature to a secondary\nheating process, likely caused by reconnection between the upward-propagating\nplasmoid and the overlying magnetic cusp structure. These observations provide\na comprehensive, observationally driven picture (from the initial photospheric\ntriggers to the multi-stage, plasmoid-mediated reconnection) that forms\nchromospheric jets, highlighting the critical role of footpoint motions in\nsolar atmospheric dynamics.",

We\nshow that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic\nabundance for dark matter masses between a few MeV to a few hundred GeV.\nSimultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via\nthe type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in\n$\\sim11\\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models,\nmisaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic\nplane on timescales of $\\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of\nthe galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of\nactive galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to\nexplore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central\nblack hole (BH) activity between $0<z<1$. We use a sample of $\\sim5600$\ngalaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\\geqslant \\mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\\odot$\nthat feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable\nmisalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that\ngalaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH\ngrowth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little\ndifference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this\nenhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned\ngas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At\n$z\\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that\nhave spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic\nmisalignments over the preceding $\\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of\naligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity\nis enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of\novermassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.",

It comes in two variants: a\nlightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous\narchitecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact\nsize, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of\nembodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B\nvariant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary\nmodels. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities,\nincluding spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial\nreferring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g.,\nclosed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph\nupdating).

Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising\ncathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its\nelectrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as\ngrain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping\nmethods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough\ntransform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling\ncomplex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale\nmicrostructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach\nfor predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated\ngeneration of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the\nanalysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning\narchitectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional\nNetworks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated,\nusing an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM\nalgorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin\nTransformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer\nachieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural\npredictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary\ndelineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring\nthe potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based\nimage data.

Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs\ndistilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they\nachieve significant improvements in reasoning performance.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) in\nwhich the standard i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior is replaced or hybridized with\na quantum-correlated prior derived from measurements of a 16-qubit entangling\ncircuit. Each latent sample is generated by grouping repeated shots per qubit\ninto a binary fraction, applying the inverse Gaussian CDF to obtain a\n16-dimensional Gaussian vector whose joint copula reflects genuine quantum\nentanglement, and then projecting into the high-dimensional space via a fixed\nrandom matrix. By pre-sampling tens of millions of bitstrings, either from a\nnoiseless simulator or from IBM hardware, we build large pools of independent\nbut internally quantum-correlated latents. We integrate this prior into three\nrepresentative architectures (WGAN, SNGAN, BigGAN) on CIFAR-10, making no\nchanges to the neural network structure or training hyperparameters. The hybrid\nlatent representations incorporating hardware-derived noise consistently lower\nthe FID relative to both the classical baseline and the simulator variant,\nespecially when the quantum component constitutes a substantial fraction of the\nprior. In addition, we execute on the QPU in parallel to not only save\ncomputing time but also further decrease the FID up to 17% in BigGAN. These\nresults indicate that intrinsic quantum randomness and device-specific\nimperfections can provide a structured inductive bias that enhances GAN\nperformance. Our work demonstrates a practical pipeline for leveraging noisy\nquantum hardware to enrich deep-generative modeling, opening a new interface\nbetween quantum information and machine learning.

    "abstract": "Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely\non fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where\nannotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with\nscarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)\nproblem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing\nLReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from\nlimited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy\nknowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,\nlearnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the\nidentity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the\ndual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and\nhistorical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this\ncyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve\ncurrent-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term\nlearning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our\nSPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-SPRED",

Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically\nrequire deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and\nimperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum\ncircuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for\nquantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising\npath forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational\nansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli\npropagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that\nimplement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and\nbeyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to\n$30 \\times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard\nTrotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To\nexperimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on\nQuantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's\ndynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without\noptimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a\npractical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced\nquantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of\nhardware-friendly ans\\\"atze.",

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of\nradiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a\ncomputationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT\nanalysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays\nthe foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools\nthat could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular\nfocus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management\nin high-risk populations.",

This paper investigates the problem of\nlocalizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment\nconsisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and\nmultiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem\nwithin an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first,\nthe optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight\n(NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to\nprevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the\nML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise\nvariance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of\nestimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization\nalgorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose\nweights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound\n(CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network\nto dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position.\nAccordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD\nposition estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs\nmisalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the\ntheoretical bounds.",

To address these limitations, we design\nDo-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system\nthat supports polyglot language learning.

The system further enhances\nlearning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module\nthat leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,\nDIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously\nincreasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.\nOur evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary\nexpansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the\ngenerated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.",

    "abstract": "The dispersion phenomenon of mass and heat transport in oscillatory flows has\nwide applications in environmental, physiological and microfluidic flows. The\nmethod of concentration moments is a powerful theoretical tool for analyzing\ntransport characteristics and is well-developed for steady flows. However, the\ngeneral solutions of moments derived by Barton (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983,\npp. 205-218) cannot be applied directly to unsteady flows. Prior studies needed\nto re-solve the governing equations of moments from scratch, encountering the\ncomplication induced by the time-periodic velocity, leaving higher-order\nstatistics like skewness and kurtosis analytically intractable except for\nspecific cases. This work proposes a novel approach based on a\ntwo-time-variable extension to tackle these challenges. By introducing an\nauxiliary time variable, referred to as oscillation time to characterize the\ninherent oscillation in the dispersion due to the oscillating flow, the\ntransport problem is extended to a two-time-variable system with a \"steady\"\nflow term. This enables the direct use of Barton's expressions and thus avoids\nthe prior complication. This approach not only offers an intuitive physical\nperspective for the influence of the velocity oscillation but also clarifies\nthe solution structure of concentration moments. As a preliminary verification,\nwe examine the transport problem in an oscillatory Couette flow. The analytical\nsolution agrees well with the numerical result by Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. The effects of the point-source release and the phase shift of\nvelocity on the transport characteristics are investigated. By extending the\nclassic steady-flow solution to the time-dependent flows, this work provides a\nversatile framework for transient dispersion analysis, enhancing predictions in\noscillatory transport problems.",

    "abstract": "Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for\nreal-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous\nteleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand\npostures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent\ndexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their\nstructural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we\npropose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables\ndexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion\npatterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the\nteleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to\ncomplete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible\ndexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures\nused in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM\n(Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to\nidentify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and\noperator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and\nimitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types\nsignificantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform\ndiverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of\nbackflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving\nFermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging\nto solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground\nstate's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of\nbackflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the\nTensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on\ntwo-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction\nstrengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision\ncan be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering\nbackflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy\nextrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient\noptimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of\n$n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition,\nby considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only\n$4.5\\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond\ndimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational\nwave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe\norder is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies\nobtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are\nlower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive\nto or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of\n$n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are\nobtained by direct optimizations.",

These constraints are mainly driven by mild\ndifferences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across\ndifferent probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional\nbackground-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models).\nHowever, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of\ncosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from\nthe way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nexpansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which\ncharacterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of\nmodels, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show\nthat allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds\nto $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial\nconstraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$.\nHowever, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions:\nto have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a\nconsistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$.

Significant correlations were found between\nLLM use and perceived literacy benefits (r = .59, p < .001) and optimism (r =\n.41, p < .001).

For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the\ncomputation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however,\nin multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce\nthe unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk\ntopological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically\nto evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large\nnumber of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all\ntopological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants,\nsuch as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments,\nwe determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like\nconfiguration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave\ncertain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending\non their symmetry properties.

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,\nalternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank\nbudget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach.

Our framework for\nloading and transferring topology is compatible with quantum teleportation when\nancillary photons are introduced, thereby promising the development of\ndistributed quantum systems with inherently secure and protected information\nchannels.

    "abstract": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity.",

Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed\nmanually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like\nImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as\nendothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may\nnot fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed\ntubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture\nand maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis\nmaturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image\ndiffered significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker\n(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count\n(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node\ncount (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across\nangiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,\nand circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more\nconsistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity\nproved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker\nis available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.",

    "abstract": "We employ first-principles calculations to explore interstitial engineering\nas a strategy to tailor the hard magnetic properties of Fe2MnSn Heusler alloy,\nestablishing its potential as a rare-earth-free permanent magnet. By\nintroducing light interstitial elements -- B, C, H, N, O, and F -- at varying\nconcentrations (1.56-12.5 at%), we uncover significant enhancements in\nstructural stability, magnetization, Curie temperature, and magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy. These dopants preferentially occupy octahedral interstitial sites\nin the hexagonal phase of Fe2MnSn, leading to localized lattice distortions\nthat enhance its magnetic characteristics. Notably, at 12.5 at% doping, B, C,\nN, and O induce a critical transition from in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic\nanisotropy -- achieved without 5d or rare-earth elements -- highlighting a\nsustainable pathway to high-performance magnets. Among these, N-doped Fe2MnSn\nexhibits the highest uniaxial anisotropy (0.61 MJ/m^3), followed by the B-doped\n(0.44 MJ/m^3) alloy. The magnetization of the doped compounds surpasses that of\nconventional ferrites and gap magnets like MnAl and MnBi. The Curie temperature\nsees a substantial boost, reaching 1058 K for O-doped Fe2MnSn and 1000 K for\nthe C-doped alloy. Although N-doping results in a modest increase in Tc (744 K\nvs. 729 K for the pristine alloy), it delivers superior hard magnetic\nproperties, with the highest magnetic hardness (0.65) and an enhanced maximum\nenergy product (0.36 MJ/m^3), making it a strong candidate for gap magnet\napplications.

There is no simple fix to this misalignment,\nsince a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected\nto identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently\nmisclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from\ndogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike.

We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD\ndetection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.\nAdditionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit\nhybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty\nrepresentation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental\nmisalignment in objectives.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study\ndemonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with\nparticular advantages in addressing complex bugs.",

In this work, we present the first\nclassical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of\ndark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our\nfindings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice\nlead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a\nsustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller\noccupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the\nfinal dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear\napproximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction.\nThis broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact\non axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic\nfragmentation.",

Several approaches have been proposed to express\ncluster number counts, but all these methods rely on empirical explicit scaling\nrelations that link observed properties to the total cluster mass. These\nscaling relations are over-parametrised, inducing some degeneracy with\ncosmology. Moreover, they do not provide a direct handle on the numerous\nnon-gravitational phenomena that affect the physics of the intra-cluster\nmedium. We present a proof-of-concept to model cluster number counts, that\nbypasses the explicit use of scaling relations. We rather implement the effect\nof several astrophysical processes to describe the cluster properties. We then\nevaluate the performances of this modelling for the cosmological inference. We\ndeveloped an accelerated machine learning baryonic field-emulator, built upon\nthe Lagrangian Deep Learning method and trained on the CAMELS simulations. We\nthen created a pipeline that simulates cluster counts in terms of XMM\nobservable quantities. We finally compare the performances of our model, with\nthat involving scaling relations, for the purpose of cosmological inference\nbased on simulations. Our model correctly reproduces the cluster population\nfrom the calibration simulations at the fiducial parameter values, and allows\nus to constrain feedback mechanisms. The cosmological-inference analyses\nindicate that our simulation-based model is less degenerate than the approach\nusing scaling relations. This novel approach to model observed cluster number\ncounts from simulations opens interesting perspectives for cluster cosmology.\nIt has the potential to overcome the limitations of the standard approach,\nprovided that the resolution and the volume of the simulations will allow a\nmost realistic implementation of the complex phenomena driving cluster\nevolution.",

The\nsame can also apply to very faint baryonic objects, such as low luminosity\ndwarf galaxies and gravitationally compact objects (e.g., rogue planets, white\ndwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, dark sirens). While they are very difficult\nto observe directly, they have locations that are highly important when\nstudying astrophysical phenomena. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm\nknown as symbolic regression to model the probability of a dark object's\nexistence as a function of their separation distances to their closest two\n``bright\" (directly observable) neighbors, and the distances of these bright\nobjects to each other. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is\ninterpretable by humans and can be used to make reproducible predictions.\nGalaxies with masses above $10^9 M_{\\odot}$ and halos above $10^{12} M_{\\odot}\n$ are the objects that we separate into ``bright\" and ``dark\" to be used in our\nanalysis. We find that it is possible to predict the density of dark objects\nusing an analytic expression that depends on their distances to their closest\nbright neighbors in Illustris-TNG galaxy formation simulations, which is\nsignificantly better than the (linear) scale-dependent biasing prediction for\n$k \\sim 1.0~ h$Mpc$^{-1}$ (and potentially beyond, if allowed by the\nresolution).

However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly\nunderstood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested\nto influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically\ninvestigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the\nmidvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge\nduring leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis,\nwe show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking\nmidvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated\nand folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both\nS-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly\nobserved due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated\nregime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling\nreveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain,\nconsistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological\noutcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and\nthe midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions\nbetween different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework\nfor understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into\nnatural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable\nstructures.",

The resulting algorithm was then packaged\nfor real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the\noriginating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while\nkeeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process,\nfuture directions are also explored.",

However, on even faster time scales, the flow of\nboth angular momentum and energy between these subsystems has so far not been\nstudied.

This rise\nis a signature that a transfer of angular momentum from the magnons to\nconduction electrons proceeds in less than 10 fs, before substantial\ndemagnetization has happened.

Our\nmodels predict the recombination of Sr$^+$ + Cs + Cs $\\rightarrow$ SrCs$^+$ +\nCs and Sr$^+$ + Cs + Cs $\\rightarrow$ Cs$_2$ + Sr$^+$ over multiple orders of\nmagnitude of energy, yielding overall results with a relative error $\\lesssim\n10\\%$. Even far beyond the range of energies seen during training, our models\npredict the atom recombination reaction rate accurately. As a result, the\nmachine is capable of learning the physics behind the atom recombination\nreaction dynamics.",

Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a\nspecific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across\nall tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content\nalignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each\nmodule only on its corresponding subject tokens.

Deployed on building structures, ASTARS reflects\nnavigation signals to outdoor receivers in urban canyons and transmits signals\nindoors to bypass obstructions, providing high-precision positioning services\nto receivers in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. The path between ASTARS and the\nreceiver is defined as the extended line-of-sight (ELoS) path and an improved\ncarrier phase observation equation is derived to accommodate that. The receiver\ncompensates for its clock bias through network time synchronization, corrects\nthe actual signal path distance to the satellite-to-receiver distance through a\ndistance correction algorithm, and determines its position by using the least\nsquares (LS) method. Mathematical modeling of the errors introduced by the\nproposed method is conducted, followed by simulation analysis to assess their\nimpact. Simulation results show that: 1) in areas where GNSS signals are\nblocked, with time synchronization accuracy within a 10 ns error range, the\nproposed method provides positioning services with errors not exceeding 4 m for\nboth indoor and outdoor receivers, outperforming conventional NLoS methods with\npositioning errors of more than 7 m; 2) the additional errors introduced by the\nproposed method do not exceed 3 m for time synchronization errors within 10 ns,\nwhich includes the phase shift, beamwidth error, time synchronization errors,\nand satellite distribution errors, outperforming traditional NLoS methods,\nwhich typically produce positioning errors greater than 5 m.",

While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric\ncomplex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may\nnot be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not\nsupported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by\ninvestigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary\namplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's\nsignals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the\nachievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK\nmodulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first\nderive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results\nreveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase\nof MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We\nthen formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting\nthe phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive\nthe optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an\nimprovement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is\nbetter than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate,\nespecially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the\nbackscatter link in SBC.",

    "abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into spatial design holds immense\npotential for optimizing space utilization, enhancing functionality, and\nstreamlining design processes. ML can automate tasks, predict performance\noutcomes, and tailor spaces to user preferences. However, the emotional,\ncultural, and aesthetic dimensions of design remain crucial for creating spaces\nthat truly resonate with users-elements that ML alone cannot address. The key\nchallenge lies in harmonizing data-driven efficiency with the nuanced,\nsubjective aspects of design. This paper proposes a human-machine collaboration\nframework to bridge this gap. An effective framework should recognize that\nwhile ML enhances design efficiency through automation and prediction, it must\nbe paired with human creativity to ensure spaces are emotionally engaging and\nculturally relevant. Human designers contribute intuition, empathy, and\ncultural insight, guiding ML-generated solutions to align with users' emotional\nand cultural needs. Additionally, we explore how various ML models can be\nintegrated with human-centered design principles. These models can automate\ndesign generation and optimization, while human designers refine the outputs to\nensure emotional resonance and aesthetic appeal. Through case studies in office\nand residential design, we illustrate how this framework fosters both\ncreativity and cultural relevance. By merging ML with human creativity, spatial\ndesign can achieve a balance of efficiency and emotional impact, resulting in\nenvironments that are both functional and deeply human.",

For effectiveness, because of the rigor of\ninterval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of\nthe nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency,\nthe method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel\nprogramming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a\nvariable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce\ncomputational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method\nis validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable\ndimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy\nfunction, and Rastrigin function.

By testing the anonymization performance of this and two\nlanguage-independent methods on the datasets, we find that only the\nmultilingual system performs well in terms of privacy and utility preservation.\nFurthermore, we observe challenges in performing utility evaluations on this\ndata because of its spontaneous character and the limited code-switching\nsupport by the multilingual speech recognition model.",

    "abstract": "Treatment planning uncertainties are typically managed using margin-based or\nrobust optimization. Margin-based methods expand the clinical target volume\n(CTV) to a planning target volume, generally unsuited for proton therapy.\nRobust optimization considers worst-case scenarios, but its quality depends on\nthe uncertainty scenario set: excluding extremes reduces robustness, while too\nmany make plans overly conservative. Probabilistic optimization overcomes these\nlimits by modeling a continuous scenario distribution. We propose a novel\nprobabilistic optimization approach that steers plans toward individualized\nprobability levels to control CTV and organs-at-risk (OARs) under- and\noverdosage. Voxel-wise dose percentiles ($d$) are estimated by expected value\n($E$) and standard deviation (SD) as $E[d] \\pm \\delta \\cdot SD[d]$, where\n$\\delta$ is iteratively tuned to match the target percentile given\nGaussian-distributed setup (3 mm) and range (3%) uncertainties. The method\ninvolves an inner optimization of $E[d] \\pm \\delta \\cdot SD[d]$ for fixed\n$\\delta$, and an outer loop updating $\\delta$. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)\nprovides accurate and efficient dose estimates during optimization. We\nvalidated the method on a spherical CTV abutted by an OAR in different\ndirections and a horseshoe-shaped CTV surrounding a cylindrical spine. For\nspherical cases with similar CTV coverage, $P(D_{2\\%} > 30 Gy)$ dropped by\n10-15%; for matched OAR dose, $P(D_{98\\%} > 57 Gy)$ increased by 67.5-71%. In\nspinal plans, $P(D_{98\\%} > 57 Gy)$ increased by 10-15% while $P(D_{2\\%} > 30\nGy)$ dropped 24-28%. Probabilistic and robust optimization times were\ncomparable for spherical (hours) but longer for spinal cases (7.5 - 11.5 h vs.\n9 - 20 min). Compared to discrete scenario-based optimization, the\nprobabilistic method offered better OAR sparing or target coverage depending on\nthe set priorities.",

Federated Learning (FL) helps address some of\nthese concerns by decentralizing DL training to edge devices, thus reducing\ndata transmission costs and enhancing privacy. Yet, the computational demands\nof DL training can still interfere with SDN's performance, especially under the\ncontinuous data streams characteristic of IoT systems.

REDUS reduces the\nnumber of training samples per epoch, thereby conserving computational\nresources, reducing energy consumption, and accelerating convergence without\nsignificantly impacting accuracy. Applied within an FL setup, REDUS enhances\nthe efficiency of model training on resource-limited edge devices while\nmaintaining network performance.

Quality refers to at least two complementary\nconcepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,\ninterpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient\nrobustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel\nmetrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample\ncontributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our\nmetrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.\nThrough analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear\nscore degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can\nbe straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that\nClipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of\nrobustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.",

To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to\nautoregressively predict continuous tokens.

    "abstract": "The bell-like ringdown of the gravitational field in the last stage of the\nmerging of massive black holes is now routinely detected on earth by the last\ngeneration of gravitational wave detectors. Its spectrum is interpreted as a\nsum of damped sinusoidal vibrations of the spacetime in the vicinity of the\nblack hole. These so-called quasinormal modes are currently the subject of\nextensive studies, yet, their true nature remains elusive. Here, we emulate, in\nthe laboratory, genuine four-dimension black hole metrics by two-dimensional\noptical curved surfaces that preserve the features of lightlike geodesics. %We\nestablish the analogy with gravitational waves radiated by relaxing black\nholes, and We analytically compute the optical quasinormal modes and show that\nthey are confined around the photon sphere, the unstable region around a black\nhole where spacetime curvature traps light in circular orbits. By 3D-printing\nnon-Euclidean dye-doped microcavities, we demonstrate lasing at the photon\nsphere with a mode profile that closely matches the analytical prediction.\nThese results paves the way for observing astrophysical phenomena in tabletop\nsetups and is likely to inspire innovative designs in photonics.",

We consider a brick-and-mortar retail\nsetting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive\nonline orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival\nof orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery\noffers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming\n(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network\n(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nintegrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost\nefficiency, with up to 6.7\\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and\napproximately 18\\% over myopic baselines.

Deep learning models can extract\ncalving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal\nice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The\ncurrent state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,\nthey are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in\nImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in\nparticular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we\npropose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that\nleverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14\nSentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the\ndataset.

The longitudinal magnetic field, the small-scale magnetic field, and the\ndifferential temperature of AU Mic, derived from the unpolarized and\ncircularly-polarized spectra, were clearly modulated with the stellar rotation\nperiod, with a pattern that evolved over time. The magnetic modeling with\nZeeman-Doppler imaging provides a consistent description of the global field of\nAU Mic that agrees not only with the Least-Squares Deconvolved profiles of the\ncircularly-polarized and unpolarized spectral lines, but also with the\nsmall-scale field measurements derived from the broadening of spectral lines,\nfor each of the 11 subsets of the full data. We find that the large-scale field\nwas mostly poloidal, with a dominant dipole component slightly tilted to the\nrotation axis which decreased from 1.4 to 1.1 kG before increasing at the end\nof the campaign. The average small-scale field followed a similar trend,\ndecreasing from 2.8 to 2.6 kG then rising. The long-term magnetic evolution we\nreport for AU Mic suggests that, if cyclic, the cycle period is significantly\nlonger than 6 yr.

These advantages make it a tantalizing platform for studying complex\nphenomena in many-particle systems, save for one severe limitation -- particles\nsuspended by sound interact via acoustic scattering forces, which cause them to\nmerge into a single dense object. To overcome this \"acoustic collapse\", we have\ndeveloped a strategy that combines acoustic levitation with controlled\nelectrostatic charging to assemble, adapt, and activate complex, many-particle\nsystems. The key idea is to introduce electrostatic repulsion, which renders a\nso-called \"mermaid\" potential where interactions are attractive at short range\nand repulsive at long range. By controlling the balance between\nattraction/repulsion, we are able to levitate fully expanded structures where\nall particles are separated, fully collapsed structures where they are all in\ncontact, and hybrid ones consisting of both expanded and collapsed components.\nWe find that fully collapsed and expanded structures are inherently stable,\nwhereas hybrid ones exhibit transient stability governed by acoustically\nunstable dimers. Furthermore, we show how electrostatics allow us to adapt\nbetween configurations on the fly, either by quasistatic discharge or discrete\nup/down charge steps. Finally, we demonstrate how large structures experience\nselective energy pumping from the acoustic field -- thrusting some particles\ninto motion while others remain stationary -- leading to complex dynamics\nincluding coupled rotations and oscillations. Our approach provides an\neasy-to-implement and easy-to-understand solution to the pervasive problem of\nacoustic collapse, while simultaneously providing new insights into the\nassembly and activation of many-particle systems with complex interactions.",

While prior studies\nhave predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and\nachieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental\nbottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key\ncomponents: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a\nsystematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our\nfindings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual\ndeficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current\nmodels. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which\nenhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby\nenabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text\ncomprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent\nsample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue\nrelated to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS\ndemonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios\nwithout requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its\ngeneral applicability.

Brain modelling has helped with assessing the\neffects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting\nclinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc.\nHowever, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this\nproject attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals\nexperiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks\nare derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG\nchannels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the\nmajor brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)\nmodel is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with\ninsomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance.\nResults indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most\nsuitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification\naccuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the\nomission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in\nmodel performance than the removal of other channels.

Extending\nthis framework to random designs, which would accommodate a much broader range\nof models, is challenged by the fundamental difficulty of reconciling a random\ncovariate design with a deterministic linear transformation. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce Model-X Split Knockoffs. Our method achieves robust FDR\ncontrol for transformation selection in random designs by introducing a novel\nauxiliary randomized design.

We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches\nbecoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when\ncombined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A\nfocus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable\nmethods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly\nstrengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.",

We first analyze different vision\nnetwork architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature\nattribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning\npromotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving\nunsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while\npreserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the\nalignment between model representations and human perception, investigating\nwhether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to\nhumans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse\nmodels exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human\nalignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and\ntheir size in terms of trainable parameters.

Hydrodynamic DFT effectively\nconnects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces\nthe framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ\nMaxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive\nmolecular transport in inhomogeneous systems.

Combining\ngeneralized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows\nfor an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system.\nThis approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces,\nand mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for\nmixtures of strongly dissimilar components.

    "abstract": "The purpose of anonymizing structured data is to protect the privacy of\nindividuals in the data while retaining the statistical properties of the data.\nAn important class of attack on anonymized data is attribute inference, where\nan attacker infers the value of an unknown attribute of a target individual\ngiven knowledge of one or more known attributes. A major limitation of recent\nattribute inference measures is that they do not take recall into account, only\nprecision. It is often the case that attacks target only a fraction of\nindividuals, for instance data outliers. Incorporating recall, however,\nsubstantially complicates the measure, because one must determine how to\ncombine recall and precision in a composite measure for both the attack and\nbaseline. This paper presents the design and implementation of an attribute\ninference measure that incorporates both precision and recall. Our design also\nimproves on how the baseline attribute inference is computed. In experiments\nusing a generic best row match attack on moderately-anonymized microdata, we\nshow that in over 25\\% of the attacks, our approach correctly labeled the\nattack to be at risk while the prior approach incorrectly labeled the attack to\nbe safe.",

    "abstract": "The optimal transport problem with squared Euclidean cost consists in finding\na coupling between two input measures that maximizes correlation. Consequently,\nthe optimal coupling is often singular with respect to Lebesgue measure.\nRegularizing the optimal transport problem with an entropy term yields an\napproximation called entropic optimal transport. Entropic penalties steer the\ninduced coupling toward a reference measure with desired properties. For\ninstance, when seeking a diffuse coupling, the most popular reference measures\nare the Lebesgue measure and the product of the two input measures. In this\nwork, we study the case where the reference coupling is not necessarily assumed\nto be a product. We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and\nprovide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a\nmatrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete\ndescription of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual\nvariables. We argue that flexibility in terms of the reference measure can be\nimportant in statistical contexts, for instance when one has prior information,\nwhen there is uncertainty regarding the measures to be coupled, or to reduce\nbias when the entropic problem is used to estimate the un-regularized transport\nproblem. In particular, we show in numerical examples that choosing a suitable\nreference plan allows to reduce the bias caused by the entropic penalty.",

We investigate the\nproperties of ionized gas around massive protostars by analyzing hydrogen\nrecombination lines (H-alpha and H-beta) in the Q-band. Observations were\nconducted using the Yebes 40m radio telescope in the Q-band (30.5~50 GHz)\ntoward six high-mass protostars selected from the SOMA Survey (G45.12+0.13,\nG45.47+0.05, G28.20-0.05, G35.20-0.74, G19.08-0.29, and G31.28+0.06).

Orion KL shows one order of\nmagnitude lower electron density, but a similar temperature. Notably, G45.12\nand G28.20 show increasing intensity with frequency for both H-alpha and\nH-beta, in contrast to the decreasing trend in Orion KL. The observed line\nwidths indicate contributions from both thermal and dynamical broadening,\nsuggesting high-temperature ionized gas affected by turbulence, outflows,\nrotation, or stellar winds.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable\nability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer\nvision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often\nmore accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and\nenergy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on\nsuch large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high\ncomputational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of\nchallenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,\ncarefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based\nway opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.\n  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to\nanalyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most\nsuitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To\nachieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an\nML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the\nsolution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's\nability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in\nterms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations.

Addressing this\ngap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer\nsimulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead.

To lower practical costs, the work also explores\nreducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD.\nExperimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed\nQPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under\nrealistic noise.

    "abstract": "Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly\ncategorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning\n(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking\ndemonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of\nbehavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's\nperformance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is\nhighly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified\nview of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that\nsynergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical\nreasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is\nboth simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone\nSFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,\nablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality\nand quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective\non LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously\nintegrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for\nfuture research.",

FACET-VLM introduces three key\ncomponents: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,\nMultiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,\nand a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.\nOur model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,\nincluding BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend\nFACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,\ndemonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional\ncues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and\nsubstantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.\nOverall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution\nfor multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.",

Nutation\ncomponents in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the\nterrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core\nNutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes\nat the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the\nobserved phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This\nphase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the\ncore and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle\nconductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these\neffects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally\nfrom the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features\nat the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal\nflow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power\nflux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB\ntopography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers.\nThe model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger\nstratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This\nmechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and\nstratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations.

Traditional task-colocated\nRL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while\ntask-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the\ncorresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing\nframeworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making\nit difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,\nwe propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient\npost-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and\ntransfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained\nscheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently\nfacilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load\nbalancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow\nengineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring\nparameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core\ncapability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training\nand inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,\noffering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with\nstate-of-the-art baseline.

    "abstract": "Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,\nediting, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients\nas inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent\nworks explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use\narchitectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,\nlimiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach\nfor designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by\nthree principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation\nsymmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to\ncapture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation\nthrough rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce\nGradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from\nsimple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and\nshow that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based\nfunctions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness\non a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as\nlearned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.",

To better understand model behavior, we group the target\nlanguages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially\nseen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen\n(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear\nperformance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best\non seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen\nlanguages.

    "abstract": "We investigate the transition to synchronization in adaptive multilayer\nnetworks with higher-order interactions both analytically and numerically in\nthe presence of phase frustration ($\\beta$). The higher order topology consists\nof pairwise and triadic couplings. The analytical framework for the\ninvestigation is based on the Ott-Antonsen ansatz which leads to a convenient\nlow-dimensional model. Extensive bifurcation analysis of the low-dimensional\nmodel and the numerical simulation of the full networks are performed to\nexplore the paths to synchronization. The combined analysis shows a complex\ndependence of the transition to synchronization on adaptation exponents,\ncoupling strengths, phase lag parameter, and multilayer configuration. Various\ntypes of transitions to synchronization, namely continuous, tiered, and\nexplosive, are exhibited by the system in different regions of the parameter\nspace. In all the cases, a satisfactory match between the low-dimensional model\nand the numerical simulation results is observed. The origin of different\ntransitions to synchronization is clearly understood using the low-dimensional\nmodel. Exploration of a wide region of the parameter space suggests that the\nphase frustration parameter inhibits tired as well as explosive synchronization\ntransitions for fixed triadic coupling strength ($K_2$). On the other hand,\ndiscontinuous transition is promoted by the phase frustration parameter for\nfixed pairwise coupling strength ($K_1$). Moreover, the exponent of the\nadaptation function with the pairwise coupling decreases the width of the\nhysteresis, despite the dominance of the higher-order coupling for fixed\n$\\beta$ and $K_2$. While, the exponent of the function adapted with\nhigher-order coupling shows the opposite effect, it promotes bistability in\nspite of dominance of pairwise coupling strength for fixed $\\beta$, and $K_1$.",

    "abstract": "We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation\nmonocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse\nenvironmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive\nperformance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world\nenvironments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination\nvariations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the\nchallenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality\npseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency\nregularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount\nof unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to\nexplicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,\nresulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.\nExperimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC\nacross diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,\nsynthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.\n  Project Page: https://ghost233lism.github.io/depthanything-AC-page\n  Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/DepthAnythingAC",

    "abstract": "With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,\nbenchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting\ntowards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional\nglobal pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper\nempirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and\npairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model\nevaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry\nmodel for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more\nreliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,\nsignificant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are\nparticularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with\nlower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,\ntext generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are\nfrequent.

Previous work on large-scale\nNeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces\nSnake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method\neliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and\noperates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest\ninto NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with\noverlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We\nintroduce a novel $2\\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented\nsampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.\nOur experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be\nprocessed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise\nin quality.",

Nevertheless,\ncurrent models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too\nmuch segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain\ncategory consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT\nframework, termed \\textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \\textbf{P}rompt\nguidance and human \\textbf{P}roximal \\textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we\nutilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention\ntowards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.\nThen a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive\nkey depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively\neliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth\nresolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D\nperspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss\n(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the\nsame area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address\nthe shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.\nSpecifically, our model achieves an improvement of \\textbf{0.7}$\\uparrow$,\n\\textbf{2.0}$\\uparrow$, \\textbf{1.6}$\\uparrow$, and \\textbf{11.0}$\\uparrow$ in\nSC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated\ndataset.

Crashes severely waste computing\nresources and hinder development productivity, so efficient crash recovery is\ncrucial. Existing solutions, such as checkpoint-retry, are too heavyweight for\nfast recovery from crashes caused by minor programming errors or transient\nruntime errors. Therefore, we present DaiFu, an in-situ recovery framework for\nDL systems. Through a lightweight code transformation to a given DL system,\nDaiFu augments it to intercept crashes in situ and enables dynamic and instant\nupdates to its program running context (e.g., code, configurations, and other\ndata) for agile crash recovery. Our evaluation shows that DaiFu helps reduce\nthe restore time for crash recovery, achieving a 1372x speedup compared with\nstate-of-the-art solutions. Meanwhile, the overhead of DaiFu is negligible\n(under 0.40%).

First, we analytically show that by flexibly\ncontrolling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form\nuniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling movable antennas (MAs) in\nthe control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) in the beam control. Although the proposed FSA experiences additional\npath-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware\nand signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning\naccuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy\ncost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem\nwith a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nbeamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform\nfrequency increment. Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can\nflexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain (by tuning\ncarrier frequency) and range domain (by controlling per-antenna frequency\noffset), thereby achieving improved PLS performance. Then, for the general\ncase, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex\nproblem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) and projected gradient\nascent (PGA) techniques.

To analyze temporal\nflow, we introduce a KL-based asymmetry measure that captures directional\ninfluence between countries and applies to both closely connected regional\ngroups and loosely connected cross-regional pairs. This analysis reveals\ndistinct pathways of content diffusion. For inter-group diffusion, we observe\nflows from ESA and South America toward North America and Europe. For\nintra-group diffusion, we find influence from Korea and Thailand to other ESA\ncountries. We also observe that ESA trends reaching other regions often\noriginate from Singapore and the Philippines. These findings offer insight into\nthe temporal structure of global cultural diffusion and highlight the\ncoexistence of global synchronization and regional independence in streaming\nmedia preferences.",

    "abstract": "We study the protoplanetary disk lifetimes using a large sample of young\nstellar objects in nearby clusters. To investigate the final phase of disk\ndissipation, we selected 32 clusters, located within 500 pc and aged between 1\nand 100 Myr, with membership determined using Gaia data. The Age and mass\ninformation of the sources are obtained through spectral energy distribution\n(SED) analysis and using evolutionary models of various ages. Using the IR data\nfrom 2MASS and WISE catalogues, we employ three methods to identify disks\nacross the different wavelength regimes (1.1- 22 $\\mu$m). We find that disk\nfraction consistently decreases as stellar systems age, a trend observed across\nall wavelengths included in this study. However, there is an increase in the\ntime scale of disk decay as wavelength increases, with characteristic\ntimescales of $\\tau_{\\text{short}}$ = 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.1 Myr for shorter wavelengths\n(1.6-4.6 $\\mu$m) versus $\\tau_{\\text{W3}}$ = 4.4 $\\pm$ 0.3 Myr for 12 $\\mu$m.\nThis supports the idea that outer disk regions evolve more slowly. Notably, we\ndetect infrared excesses at 12 $\\mu$m and 22 $\\mu$m in relatively older systems\n($>$10 Myr), with some disks with estimated ages up to $\\sim$ 100 Myr. Among\nthese, we identify a population of full disks that persist beyond the typical\ndissipation timescale. We also observe that the median mass of disk-hosting\nstars decreases from 0.62 $M_\\odot$ to 0.27 $M_\\odot$ in clusters younger and\nolder than 40 Myr, respectively, indicating slower disk dissipation around\nlower-mass stars. We identify 33 transitional disk candidates using various\ncolor-color diagrams. Using LAMOST DR8 optical spectra and H-alpha equivalent\nwidths, we identify possible accretors and estimate their mass accretion rates,\nfinding most are younger than 10 Myr.",

The movement of the free\nboundary of the domain is driven by the velocity field of the mixture in the\nbulk, which is determined by a Navier--Stokes equation. In order to take\ninteractions between bulk and boundary into account, we further consider two\nmaterials on the boundary, which may be the same or different materials as\nthose in the bulk. The bulk and the surface materials are represented by\nrespective phase-fields, whose time evolution is described by a bulk-surface\nconvective Cahn--Hilliard equation.

By leveraging social connections\nand group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate\nand engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently,\ninfluence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the\nimpact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we\nproposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task.\nHowever, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and\never-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence\npropagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of\nreal-time group-item matching.\n  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group\nRecommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based\nSampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social\ngraphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items.\nSecond, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict\nhow influence propagates over time across social items and user groups.\nFinally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to\nefficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation\ngeneration.

While ordinal comparison data\nintuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper\nchallenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework\nfor modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a\ngeneralized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the\npreference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the\ndistribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical\nbinary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as\nbinarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that\nbinarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking\nrecovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking\nerror associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential\nconvergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a\nsubstantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function.

On the other hand, the\nexisting end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds\nthe speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,\nresulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and\nresonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying\nspeech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation\nusually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.\nIn this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech\nas sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process\nto propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech\nsignals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to\nmodel the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the\namplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the\nspeech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting\nand time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network\nsize decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the\nstrengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the\noutperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,\nsynthesis quality, and modification flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum\ncomputers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum\ninformation non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a\nshared fermionic state whose occupation -- either even or odd -- defines the\nfermionic parity that encodes the qubit. Crucially, this parity cannot be\naccessed by any measurement that probes only one Majorana mode. This reflects\nthe non-local nature of the encoding and its inherent protection against noise.\nA promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain, implemented\nin quantum dots coupled via superconductors. Even a minimal chain of two dots\ncan host a pair of Majorana modes and store quantum information in their joint\nparity. Here we introduce a new technique for reading out this parity, based on\nquantum capacitance. This global probe senses the joint state of the chain and\nenables real-time, single-shot discrimination of the parity state. By comparing\nwith simultaneous local charge sensing, we confirm that only the global signal\nresolves the parity. We observe random telegraph switching and extract parity\nlifetimes exceeding one millisecond. These results establish the essential\nreadout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a\nlong-standing experimental challenge.",

The\nthermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and\ncharacterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined\nsystem, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment\nensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of\nfreedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact\ntime evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics,\nquantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while\nensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical\nvalidity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes\nand initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic\nentanglement-disentanglement behavior.

The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be\nviewed as a bipartite graph, called the \\emph{middle graph} of the\ntriangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a\ntree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase\nstructure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph\ncomes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components\nand loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows\none to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted\ntree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of\na new phase, referred to as the \\emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar\ncrumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase\ntransitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to\ntriple-tree phase transition is continuous.",

Existing methods typically split videos into\noverlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across\ndifferent windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.\nAdditionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the\ninherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically\ninconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,\ntraining-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and\ngeometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we\nintroduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and\ngeometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the\ninherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,\nsteering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions.

Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce\nlatency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are\ndropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and\nconvergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.\nWe address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training\nframework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased\ngradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code\nor optimizers.

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately\nreproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering\nstatistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red\ngalaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy\nsample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo\nabundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which\nfollows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of\n$8\\,h^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.\nUsing SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r<19.5$)\ngalaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and\nluminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\\rm r}\\leq 20$). Furthermore, we\nanalyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each\ntracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately\nreproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\\%\nagreement for separations of $1<r<20\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\\% for\n$0.1<r<1\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully\ncaptured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS\nmock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We\nalso find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of\nlarge-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for\nLRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating\nhigh-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our\nunderstanding of the galaxy--halo connection.",

    "abstract": "Context. The HR 8799 system, hosting four giant planets between a warm and\ncold debris disc, and an extended dusty tail beyond, serves as an ideal\nlaboratory for studying planetary formation and evolution. The debris discs\nhave been observed across various wavelengths, and the planetary properties are\nwell-constrained. Nonetheless, there are still open questions regarding the\nrole of the planets in shaping the debris discs.\n  Aims. We investigate the system's evolution with the aim of understanding how\nplanetary migration shapes its architecture, both in terms of planets and the\ndisc.\n  Methods. We performed $N$-body simulations to model the HR 8799 system. We\nexamined the orbital evolution of the known four super-Jupiter planets through\nthe course of simple, imposed migration in a gaseous disc as they perturb an\nexternal, massless planetesimal disc. We also explore the impact of introducing\na fifth planet on the dynamical and morphological aspects of the disc.\n  Results. The planets migrate outward as a result of their imposed\ninteractions with the gaseous disc while maintaining their resonant\nconfiguration. This outward migration excites the planetesimal disc, producing\na transient scattered population. While a four-planet system partially\nreproduces the observed cavity between the star and the cold debris disc, the\ninclusion of a fifth low-mass planet appears to be crucial for better\nreproducing key morphological aspects of the cold debris disc.\n  Conclusions. This model provides a novel explanation for the architecture of\nHR 8799. Outward planetary migration, combined with mean motion resonant\ninteractions and a fifth, low-mass planet, can effectively replicate the\nobserved planetary architecture and cold debris disc characteristics. Our\nfindings underscore the potential important role of planetary migration in\nshaping debris discs.",

    "abstract": "The Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition challenged participants\nto forecast and trade the electricity generation from a 3.6GW portfolio of wind\nand solar farms in Great Britain for three months in 2024. The competition\nmimicked operational practice with participants required to submit genuine\nforecasts and market bids for the day-ahead on a daily basis. Prizes were\nawarded for forecasting performance measured by Pinball Score, trading\nperformance measured by total revenue, and combined performance based on rank\nin the other two tracks. Here we present an analysis of the participants'\nperformance and the learnings from the competition. The forecasting track\nreaffirms the competitiveness of popular gradient boosted tree algorithms for\nday-ahead wind and solar power forecasting, though other methods also yielded\nstrong results, with performance in all cases highly dependent on\nimplementation. The trading track offers insight into the relationship between\nforecast skill and value, with trading strategy and underlying forecasts\ninfluencing performance.

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both\ndiscriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of\nDiscriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement\n(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map\nusing a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed\ninto a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation\nsubsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the\ncoarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic\nsegmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our\nframework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results\nfrom diverse discriminative architectures.

In the present work, I\ncarry out an in-depth study comparing methods for calculating perihelion\nadvance of inner planets using two methods, one based on the rotation of the\nLaplace-Runge-Lentz vector and the other on the evolution of the perihelion\nlongitude. I show that, although the two methods predict almost identical\nperihelion advances for inner planets according to classical gravitational\ntheory and the general relativity model, they give divergent results for the\nasteroid Icarus. Comparing numerical calculations of Icarus'perihelion advance\nwith those predicted by Einstein's formula leads to the conclusion that only\nthe method based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector offers a consistent\nexplanation for the behavior of Icarus' perihelion advance. By incorporating\nthe hypothetical planet Vulcan into the Newtonian gravitational model and\nanalyzing its influence on the perihelion advances of the inner planets, I find\nthat carefully selecting Vulcan's mass and orbital parameters yields a delicate\nbalance between its semi-major axis and mass necessary to simultaneously match\nthe observed perihelion advances of the inner planets. Vulcan, orbiting at a\nsemi-major axis of 0.545 AU and possessing about one-third the mass of Mercury,\ncould exert gravitational effects on Earth and Mars comparable to those\npredicted by GR. This Vulcan would cause an effect on Icarus' perihelion\nadvance approximately nine times greater than the relativistic effect.

Our experiments show that models\nthat have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock\nof transferring to a new domain.

    "abstract": "Markov-switching models are a powerful tool for modelling time series data\nthat are driven by underlying latent states. As such, they are widely used in\nbehavioural ecology, where discrete states can serve as proxies for behavioural\nmodes and enable inference on latent behaviour driving e.g. observed movement.\nTo understand drivers of behavioural changes, it is common to link model\nparameters to covariates. Over the last decade, nonparametric approaches have\ngained traction in this context to avoid unrealistic parametric assumptions.\nNonetheless, existing methods are largely limited to univariate smooth\nfunctions of covariates, based on penalised splines, while real processes are\ntypically complex requiring consideration of interaction effects. We address\nthis gap by incorporating tensor-product interactions into Markov-switching\nmodels, enabling flexible modelling of multidimensional effects in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Based on the extended Fellner-Schall method,\nwe develop an efficient automatic smoothness selection procedure that is robust\nand scales well with the number of smooth functions in the model. The method\nbuilds on a random effects view of the spline coefficients and yields a\nrecursive penalised likelihood procedure. As special cases, this general\nframework accommodates bivariate smoothing, function-valued random effects, and\nspace-time interactions. We demonstrate its practical utility through three\necological case studies of an African elephant, common fruitflies, and Arctic\nmuskoxen. The methodology is implemented in the LaMa R package, providing\napplied ecologists with an accessible and flexible tool for semiparametric\ninference in hidden-state models. The approach has the potential to drastically\nimprove the level of detail in inference, allowing to fit HMMs with hundreds of\nparameters, 10-20 (potentially bivariate) smooths to thousands of observations.",

Previous studies reported that\nMIPS is one of the phenomena so-called \"reentrant phase separation\" ,i.e., MIPS\nis suppressed when the P\\'eclet number $Pe$ (dimensionless self-propelled\nspeed) is sufficiently large. We used a fundamental model of SPPs, i.e.,\noverdamped Active Brownian Partcles (ABPs), to investigate the mechanism of the\nreentrancy of MIPS. We expect that elucidating the conditions under which MIPS\noccur is important, since MIPS is a phenomenon that can occur in a wide range\nof SPPs systems, and the potential applications of MIPS can also be wide range.\nDetailed investigation of particle motion revealed that a entire particle\ncluster deforms due to multiple slip deformation (known as plastic deformation\nin materials science). As $Pe$ increases, the frequency of occurrence of\nslip-lines increases, and the particle motion becomes fluid-like. Therefore,\nthe shape of the cluster becomes unstable and the number of particles in the\ncluster decreases. Let $\\bf{f}_{LA}$ be the local spatial average of the\nself-propelled force generated by the particles. The observation of the\ninhomogeneity in the magnitude and direction of $\\bf{f}_{LA}$ shows that\n$\\bf{f}_{LA}$ is large on the cluster surface and generally orients toward the\ncluster inside.

    "abstract": "The $L_{\\rm IR}-L_{\\rm HCN}$ relation suggests that there is a tight\nconnection between dense gas and star formation. We use data from the Close AGN\nReference Survey (CARS) to investigate the dense gas - star formation relation\nin AGN hosting galaxies, and the use of dense gas as an active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) diagnostic. Our sample contains five Type-1 (unobscured) AGN that were\nobserved with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the\naim to detect HCN(4-3), HCO$^+$(4-3) and CS(7-6). We detect the dense gas\nemission required for this analysis in 3 of the 5 targets. We find that despite\nthe potential impact from the AGN on the line fluxes of these sources, they\nstill follow the $L_{\\rm IR}-L_{\\rm HCN}$ relation. We then go on to test\nclaims that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS line ratios can be used as a tool to\nclassify AGN in the sub-mm HCN diagram. We produce the classic ionised\nemission-line ratio diagnostics (the so-called BPT diagrams), using available\nCARS data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We then compare\nthe BPT classification with the sub-mm classification made using the dense gas\ntracers. Where it was possible to complete the analysis we find general\nagreement between optical and sub-mm classified gas excitation mechanisms. This\nsuggests that AGN can contribute to the excitation of both the low density gas\nin the warm ionised medium and the high density gas in molecular clouds\nsimultaneously, perhaps through X-ray, cosmic ray or shock heating mechanisms.",

In order to further develop this concept, it is crucial to\nelucidate the mechanism underlying these local changes. Here, UV-VIS and\ninfrared spectroscopic techniques, as well as Gas Chromatography - Mass\nSpectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been used\nto investigate the physico-chemical changes induced by this process in the\nphotoactive layer of proof-of-concept photo-patterned dye-sensitized solar\ncells.

One of these systematic effects was initially studied by Hartlap et al.\nin 2011, namely that image overlap with (bright foreground) galaxies may\nprevent some distant (source) galaxies to remain undetected. Since this overlap\nis more likely to occur in regions of high foreground density -- which tend to\nbe the regions in which the shear is largest -- this detection bias would cause\nan underestimation of the estimated shear correlation function. This detection\nbias adds to the possible systematic of image blending, where nearby pairs or\nmultiplets of images render shear estimates more uncertain and thus may cause a\nreduction in their statistical weight. Based on simulations with data from the\nKilo-Degree Survey, we study the conditions under which images are not\ndetected. We find an approximate analytic expression for the detection\nprobability in terms of the separation and brightness ratio to the neighbouring\ngalaxies. Applying this fitting formula to weak lensing ray tracing through,\nand the galaxy distribution in the Millennium Simulation, we estimate that the\ndetection bias alone leads to an underestimate of\n$S_8=\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ by almost 2\\% and can therefore not\nbe neglected in current and forthcoming cosmic shear surveys.",

In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%.

The factional damping setting forces us to\nwork with non-integrable kernels, which require a tailored approach in the\nanalysis to control. This approach relies on exploiting the specific\nnonlinearity structure combined with a weak damping provided by the nonlocality\nkernel.",

    "abstract": "High harmonic generation (HHG) in gaseous media provides a robust method for\nproducing coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation and attosecond pulses.\nHowever, the spectral and temporal properties of these pulses -- such as\nbandwidth and chirp -- are fundamentally limited by the underlying generation\nmechanisms. Typically, tailoring the EUV emission involves modifying the\nproperties of the intense infrared femtosecond driving pulse, and/or the\nmacroscopic laser-matter configuration. Here, we focus on controlling the HHG\nprocess through the gas specie, introducing mixed-gas targets as a practical\napproach to enhance control over the EUV harmonic radiation. Through advanced\nsimulations assisted by artificial intelligence that take into account both the\nquantum microscopic and macroscopic aspects of HHG, we demonstrate how mixtures\nof argon and helium modulate the emitted EUV harmonics. A simple model reveals\nthat these modulations arise from coherent interference between harmonics\nemitted by different species at the single-atom level, and that they can be\ntuned by adjusting the macroscopic relative concentrations. Furthermore, by\nspatially separating the gas species into two distinct jets in a symmetric\nconfiguration, we gain additional control over the whole harmonic bandwidth.\nThis strategy provides a realistic and versatile pathway to tailor EUV light\nand attosecond sources via HHG, while also enabling the identification of\nspecies-specific contributions to the process.",

    "abstract": "We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions\n$d\\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral\nand electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a\nrigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color\ntransparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing\ncorrections associated with the $|Q\\bar Q\\rangle$ and $|Q\\bar QnG\\rangle$ Fock\ncomponents of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent\nthe dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the\nrecent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider\nat RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark\nshadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the\ndifferential cross sections $d\\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations\nbased on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist\nshadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial\ndipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in\nthe LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of\n$d\\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased\nonset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how\nthe color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear\nmodification factor.

This antagonism often makes crossover reduce its own effectiveness.\n  We introduce a new paradigm for utilizing crossover that reduces this\nantagonism, which we call diversity-preserving exploitation of crossover\n(DiPEC). The resulting Diversity Exploitation Genetic Algorithm (DEGA) is able\nto still exploit the benefits of crossover, but preserves a much higher\ndiversity than conventional approaches.\n  We demonstrate the benefits by proving that the (2+1)-DEGA finds the optimum\nof LeadingOnes with $O(n^{5/3}\\log^{2/3} n)$ fitness evaluations. This is\nremarkable since standard genetic algorithms need $\\Theta(n^2)$ evaluations,\nand among genetic algorithms only some artificial and specifically tailored\nalgorithms were known to break this runtime barrier.

    "abstract": "The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a\nsignificant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass\nregime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO),\nwith its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical\nspectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of\nmassive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to\ndynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \\, \\rm\nM_\\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity\ndispersions down to 30 $\\rm km \\, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend\ncurrent black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing\nthe fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments.\nUsing a volume-limited sample of $\\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing\ncatalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and\nenable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet\nabsorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed\nformation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy\nseeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain\nimprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer\ncritical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black\nholes and galaxies across cosmic time.",

A small number of highly\nproductive authors contribute significantly to the overall research output. The\nkeyword clustering analysis results in ten major clusters, including topics\nsuch as plastic pollution and microbial communities.

The project aims at investigating any aspect of the chemical\nevolution of high-mass star-forming cores by observing representatives of the\nthree main evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass\nprotostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We carried out an unbiased\nspectral line survey of the entire bandwidth at 3, 2, and 1.2 mm with the 30m\ntelescope of the Insitut de Radioastronomie millimetrique towards three targets\nthat represent the three evolutionary stages. The number of lines and species\ndetected increases with evolution. In this first work, we derive the\ntemperature structure of the targets through the analysis of the carbon-bearing\nspecies C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, C4H, CH3CCH, HC3N, CH3CN, and HC5N. The excitation\ntemperature, Tex, increases with evolution in each species, although not in the\nsame way. Hydrocarbons tend to be associated with the smallest Tex values and\nenhancements with evolution, while cyanides are associated with the highest Tex\nvalues and enhancements. In each target, the higher the number of atoms in the\nmolecule, the higher Tex tends to be. The temperature structure evolves from a\ncold, uniform envelope traced by simple hydrocarbons in the high-mass starless\ncore stage, to a more stratified envelope in the protostellar stage (made by a\nhot core, a shell with intermediate Tex, and a larger cold envelope), to\nfinally a hot core surrounded only by a cold envelope in the Ultracompact HII\nstage.",

We prove that the resulting tube algebra is\nnaturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure.

Motivated by\nthis, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense\nframework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while\nrestoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs\nwhile preserving efficiency.

Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a\nSchwarzschild orbit at a 10$\\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount\nof extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\\odot$, under the\nassumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work\nwe investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass\ndistribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects\nsurrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full\nN-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2\nwith different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that\ngranularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a\nsmooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of\nthe in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a\nsort of \"Brownian motion\" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that\nthese effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from\na Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter\npassage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the\nastrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\\mu as$, as it happens\nin 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\\odot$. This\npresents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects\non the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable\nprecision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to\nconstrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly\naccount for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.",

    "abstract": "Light reprocessed by dust grains emitting in the infrared allows the study of\nthe physics at play in dusty, embedded regions, where ultraviolet and optical\nwavelengths are attenuated. Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it\npossible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by\ncocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of\nfeedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of\ntheir host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded\nto the exposed phase of star formation is short (< 4 Myr) and sometimes almost\nabsent (< 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering\na wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs.\nThe short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role\nof pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming\nprevious results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a\nstatistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales\nassociated with mid-infrared emission at 21 {\\mu}m, tracing a dust-embedded\nfeedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular\ncloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We\nreport relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in\nbarred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass\nirregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase\nmetallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.",

However, overlapping clusters and background noise\nhinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that\nrely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters.\nThis study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised\nmeteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established\nCameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze\nthe CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS\ngeocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted\ngeocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes\nand two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters\nwith CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal\nmapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score,\nNormalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis\nfurther supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39\nmeteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies\n30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose\nidentification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior\nperformance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful\nselection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally\nconsistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical\ncoherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically\nconsistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further\nvalidation is needed to assess physical validity.",

The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an\nefficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by\npulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this\nsuppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair\nconfinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at\nunderstanding which type of medium pulsars are probing over their lifetime. We\ndeveloped a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their\nbirth in core-collapse explosions, where they receive a natal kick, until their\nentry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo\nsampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a\ncalculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these\nprogenitors, for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; (iii) a\ncomputation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent\nenvironments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities,\nwe assess in which medium pulsars are located as a function of time. We first\nderive the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population, and\nthen apply the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely\nnature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the ISM at around\n200 kyr, significantly later than the values most commonly used in the\nliterature. The majority of known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high\nprobabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that\nefficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor\nstars. In order to test this idea, we provide the probability of still residing\nin the parent environment for a list of known pulsars.",

Drawing on Misesian a priori\nreasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems\nare incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination:\ninterpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value\nthrough prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as\noptimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under\nuncertainty.\n  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability,\nand Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which\nconflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights.\nAttempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of\nethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms,\ninterpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned,\nand inert.\n  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance\ndegrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft\ntotalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over\nAI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned\nchoice.

Deep learning and\ngenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly\nenhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient\ndecision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,\nvehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic\nmanagement. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive\nvolumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant\nchallenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel\nconditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic\ncommunication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and\nefficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and\ncompresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel\nis estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to\npredict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV\nservice. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may\nbe degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely\naffect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to\nfine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying\nscenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are\nevaluated on the two public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Automated unit test generation is an established research field that has so\nfar focused on statically-typed programming languages. The lack of type\ninformation in dynamically-typed programming languages, such as Python,\ninhibits test generators, which heavily rely on information about parameter and\nreturn types of functions to select suitable arguments when constructing test\ncases. Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of\ncandidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this\nproblem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information\nduring execution and gradually refines the available type information. We\nimplement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework\nfor Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how\nparameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that\nfunction calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code\ncoverage.

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some\nexample images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.\nDesigning a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects\nwithout (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we\npresent a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold\nbased Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models:\nGrounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and\ncorresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch\nembeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object\nmatching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the\nsimilarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the\npatch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates\nunstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns.\nBeyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by\nobject selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the\nproposals bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only\npipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that\nNOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, attains state-of-the-art results\nregarding the mean AP score, w.r.t. the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven\ncore datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of\nunseen objects\" task.",

    "abstract": "RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging\nfrom embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its\nRISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI\nworkloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of\nRISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the\nautovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like\nmuRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing\nthe integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the\nefficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a\nworkflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V\nvector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the\nRVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program\nframework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on\nan FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our\nproposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared\nagainst the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.\nMoreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory\nfootprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also\nevaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the\nRVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that\nare 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM.

    "abstract": "The optimal transport (OT) map offers the most economical way to transfer one\nprobability measure distribution to another. Classical OT theory does not\ninvolve a discussion of preserving topological connections and orientations in\ntransmission results and processes. Existing numerical and geometric methods\nfor computing OT seldom pays specific attention on this aspect. Especially,\nwhen dealing with the triangular mesh data, the known semi-discrete geometric\nOT (sd-OT) method employs critical operation of Delaunay triangulation (DT) to\nadapt topology to ensure the convexity of the energy function and the existence\nof the solution. This change in topology hampers the applicability of OT in\nmodeling non-flip physical deformations in real-world tasks such as shape\nregistration and editing problems in computer vision and medical imaging\nfields. This work introduces the topology structure-preserving optimal\ntransport (QC-OT) map for the triangular mesh input. The computational strategy\nfocuses on the two components: relaxing DT and convexity check in sd-OT and\nintegrating quasiconformal (QC) correction. Here, quasiconformal mapping is\nemployed to correct the regions unexpected distortions, and guarantee the\ntopological preserving property of the transport.

    "abstract": "Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous\nobjects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we\npropose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that\nsequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual\nrepresentations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection\nmodel's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other\npixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the\nperformance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our\nframework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.",

In this paper, an efficient, accurate,\nand widely applicable pseudospectral method is proposed to solve\nmulti-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems with various\nobjective functions and perturbations. The method is based on the Sundman\ntransformation and pseudospectral method, together with a sparse mesh that is\nmonotonic, near-uniformly spaced, and uniformly scattered on the unit circle.\nTwo methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on\nrotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random\nsequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed,\nincluding the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the\ntemporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of\nthe system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector\nfields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is\ndemonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem.\nResults show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with only a few\nseconds of computational time for challenging problems.",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose\ndraft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,\nhas emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many\nendeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and\ngenerate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate\nthe drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and\napplications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to\nretrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods\noften fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this\nchallenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and\nfind the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the\nobservation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next\ntoken, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec\ngenerates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate\nthe next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token\nand the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive\nexperiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that\nLogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens\nper decoding step.

    "abstract": "The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical\nto perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated\nproposals to ``parameterize\" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The\nleading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy\n(EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small\nnumber of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the\nEFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a\nfully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories\nwith screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general\nmethod for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background\nexpansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the\nEFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is\napplicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified\ngravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence,\nand generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories,\nwe discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While\nthis method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial\nconditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and\n$k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker\nsolution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations.\nThis offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the\nbackground and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics\nof dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine\nDE theories systematically and in much greater detail.",

We use a pebble-based\nthermophysical model of gas-pressure build-up in the subsurface to reproduce\nthe global emission rates of dust, water, CO$_{2}$, and CO observed by Rosetta\nat comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P). For sufficiently low\ndiffusivities, the low tensile strength is overcome, leading to the ejection of\n$\\sim$ millimetre- to decimetre-sized dust-particles as well as roughly the\ncorrect outgassing rates. All the ejections, and thus the bulk of the\noutgassing, come from the southern hemisphere during the time that it is\nstrongly illuminated at perihelion. This leads to a 'blow-off' of the\ndust-crust that otherwise forms: volatiles are much closer to the surface in\nthe south (within the top centimetre) than in the north (10-or-more cm deep),\nnaturally explaining the strong southern water-outgassing expected from 67P's\nnon-gravitational accelerations and torques. We find that low gas-diffusivity,\nas well as large heat-capacity and steeply decreasing tensile strength with\ndepth or ice-content, are in best agreement with the outgassing data. However,\neven in these cases, we struggle not to exceed the observed emission rates of\ndust, CO$_{2}$, and CO. In the south, it is difficult for models to achieve a\nbalance between triggering activity and generating too much of it (with\nCO$_{2}$ the critical driving-species here); while in the north, it remains\nchallenging to generate activity at all. Strong constraints are placed on the\nnature of the activity mechanism by the location of dust-ejection and erosion.",

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with\nsubstantial speed improvements.

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and\nhigh-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep\nlearning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified\nmodeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The\nstudy is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is\nused to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer\nself-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and\ntheir contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then\napplied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a\ncontext-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational\ncapacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse\ninformation. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of\nexperiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter\nsensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.\nResults demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms\nrepresentative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The\nmodel maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference\nlevels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study\noffers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical\ntexts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling\ntasks.",

To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its\npotential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM\nassistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,\ncategorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we\ncompare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully\ngenerate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more\nconstrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code\nconstruction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual\nencodings) based on properties of the example code and data.

A cohort of 56 MCIs and 26 healthy controls (HCs) performed tasks\nwith congruent and incongruent stimuli of varying saliency levels.

While RFs are typically used to estimate mean responses\n(conditional on covariates), they can also be used to estimate quantiles by\nestimating the full distribution of the response. However, standard approaches\nfor building RFs often result in excessively biased quantile estimates. To\nreduce this bias, our proposed tuning procedure minimizes \"quantile coverage\nloss\" (QCL), which we define as the estimated bias of the marginal quantile\ncoverage probability estimate based on the out-of-bag sample. We adapt QCL\ntuning to handle censored data and demonstrate its use with random survival\nforests. We show that QCL tuning results in quantile estimates with more\naccurate coverage probabilities than those achieved using default parameter\nvalues or traditional tuning (using MSPE for uncensored data and C-index for\ncensored data), while also reducing the estimated MSE of these coverage\nprobabilities. We discuss how the superior performance of QCL tuning is linked\nto its alignment with the estimation goal.

In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image.

To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations.

    "abstract": "Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image\nenhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant\ncolor background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a\ndiffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called\nDocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,\nenabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the\nissue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).\nIt is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions\nspecially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion\nmodule (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by\nsupervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a\nshadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in\ndocument images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color\nshadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic\ncolor shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.\nExperiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority\nover state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial\nblack holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then\nthe observed GeV {\\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be\nattributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional\nto the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies,\npotentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark\nmatter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is\nobtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs\nthrough cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak\ngravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak\nlensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such\ncorrelations can reveal a PBH {\\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically\nsignificant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been\nobserved, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical\nsources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH\nevaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw\nattention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X,\nobserved at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their\nsignificant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent\nmassive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such\nclusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering\ninsights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the\nunderlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and\nsimilar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large\nscale structure.",

The objective is to design a reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithm to approximate the decentralized asymptotic optimal social control in\nterms of two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs). In this problem, a coupling\nterm is introduced into the system dynamics to capture the interactions among\nagents. This causes the equivalence between model-based and model-free methods\nto be invalid, which makes it difficult to directly apply traditional\nmodel-free algorithms. Firstly, under the assumptions of system stabilizability\nand detectability, a model-based policy iteration algorithm is proposed to\napproximate the stabilizing solution of the AREs. The algorithm is proven to be\nconvergent in both cases of semi-positive definite and indefinite weight\nmatrices. Subsequently, by adopting the method of system transformation, a\nmodel-free RL algorithm is designed to solve for asymptotic optimal social\ncontrol. During the iteration process, the updates are performed using data\ncollected from any two agents and MF state. Finally, a numerical case is\nprovided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These\ntwo mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase\ntransitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used\nOLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar\nphenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs\nsecond-task-token performance.",

However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative\nvision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated\ncaptions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the\nproperties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot\nsmoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output\ncaptions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,\nCaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\\% despite\nbetter lexical alignment. Code will be available on\nhttps://github.com/omron-sinicx/captionsmiths.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Flexible First-Order Stochastic Dominance (FFSD), a\nmathematically rigorous framework that formalizes Herbert Simon's concept of\nbounded rationality using the Lean 4 theorem prover. We develop\nmachine-verified proofs demonstrating that FFSD bridges classical expected\nutility theory with Simon's satisficing behavior through parameterized\ntolerance thresholds. Our approach yields several key results: (1) a critical\nthreshold $\\varepsilon < 1/2$ that guarantees uniqueness of reference points,\n(2) an equivalence theorem linking FFSD to expected utility maximization for\napproximate indicator functions, and (3) extensions to multi-dimensional\ndecision settings. By encoding these concepts in Lean 4's dependent type\ntheory, we provide the first machine-checked formalization of Simon's bounded\nrationality, creating a foundation for mechanized reasoning about economic\ndecision-making under uncertainty with cognitive limitations. This work\ncontributes to the growing intersection between formal mathematics and economic\ntheory, demonstrating how interactive theorem proving can advance our\nunderstanding of behavioral economics concepts that have traditionally been\nexpressed only qualitatively.",

While the sizes of the radio sources that\ncan be observed in the solar corona is essential for understanding the nature\nof density turbulence within the solar corona and its subsequent influence on\nthe angular broadening observed in radio source measurements, the smallest\nradio sources associated with solar radio bursts have so far been limited by\nobservational techniques and the radio instrument's baselines. We selected\nthree type II bursts that were observed with the LOFAR core and remote stations\nin the Solar Cycle 24. We estimated the sizes and shapes (ellipticity) of the\nradio sources between $20-200$ MHz using a two-dimensional Gaussian\napproximation. Our analysis shows that the smallest radio source size for type\nII bursts in the solar corona which can be observed in the solar atmosphere at\nlow frequencies is $1.5^\\prime \\pm 0.5^\\prime$ at 150 MHz. However, even though\nthe observations were taken with remote baselines (with a maximum distance of\n$\\sim 85~km$), the effective baselines were much shorter ($\\sim 35~km$) likely\ndue to snapshot imaging of the Sun. Our results show that the radio source\nsizes are less affected by scattering than suggested in previous studies.

Namely, the limiting distribution follows a power-law distribution.\nIn this paper, we generalize our result to the bivariate setting. We do so\nusing Arnold's type definition [2] of a Lorenz curve, which offers the greatest\nparsimony among its counterparts. The situation becomes more complex in higher\ndimensions as the map affects not only the marginals but also their dependence\nstructure. Nevertheless, we prove the equally surprising result that under\nreasonable restrictions, the marginals again converge uniformly to a power-law\ndistribution, with an exponent equal to the golden section. Furthermore, they\nbecome independent in the limit.

This paper explores alternatives by comparing the\nestablished method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic\nsignal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with\nunigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)\nderived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert\nclassifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the\nintrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.\nResults show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with\nlinguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides\na clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable\nalternative to traditional cognate-based methods.

The direct method is particularly suited to close-in gas giants,\nleveraging the Hanle and Zeeman effects to detect low-amplitude magnetic\nfields. The indirect method can apply to both giant and low-mass planets by\nidentifying magnetic connectivity-induced features in the stellar atmosphere.\nAlthough the interpretation of current detections remain tentative, upcoming\nhigh-resolution spectropolarimetric capabilities in the UV and near-infrared,\nparticularly with future missions like HWO, promise to enable definitive\nmeasurements of exoplanetary magnetic fields.

The ground state\nmagnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic spin-trimers of Ni2+ ions. The\nspin-trimers are coupled antiferromagnetically along the c-axis and\nferromagnetically along the a-axis. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reveals\ngapped and dispersive magnon excitations below the TN, and gapless\nquasi-elastic scatterings at higher temperature. The linear spin-wave theory\nsimulations reveal the essential features of the excitation spectrum; by a spin\nHamiltonian composed of ferromagnetic intra-trimer exchange interaction J1 and\ninter-trimer exchange interactions J2 (FM) and J3(AFM) within the bc plane. The\nJ2 and J3 along the b-axis and c-axis, respectively, with strengths of\nJ2/J1=0.79 and J3/J1=-0.91. In addition, a weak inter planer ferromagnetic\nexchange interaction J4 (|J4/J1|~0.12) is found along the a-axis. The\ndetermined exchange constants reveal a 2D trimerized Collinear-II spin lattice\nwithin the bc-plane. The analysis of INS spectra by linear spin-wave theory\nalso yields a moderate single-ion anisotropy (D/J1=0.48) which accounts for the\nobserved spin gap below TN as well as the metamagnetic transition near 44 kOe\nin dc magnetization (M vs H) curves.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and validate a two-species Multiscale model for a\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, focusing on the correlated motion of\npositive and negative ions under the influence of a trap. Specifically, we aim\nto model surface traps whose attraction range, of length delta, is much smaller\nthen the scale of the problem. The physical setup we refer to is an anchored\ngas drop (bubble) surrounded by a diffusive flow of charged surfactants (ions).\nWhen the diffusing surfactants reach the surface of the trap, the anions are\nadsorbed. As in our previous works [11,6,9,4], the effect of the attractive\npotential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass\nconservation and asymptotic analysis. The novelty of this work is the extension\nof the model proposed in [11], now incorporating the influence of both carriers\n- positive and negative ions - simultaneously, which is often neglected in\ntraditional approaches that treat ion species independently. In the second part\nof the paper, we address the treatment of the Coulomb interaction between\ncarriers. When the Debye length lambda_D (proportional to a small parameter\nepsilon) is very small, one can adopt the so-called Quasi-Neutral limit, which\nsignificantly simplifies the system, reducing it to a diffusion equation for a\nsingle carriers with effective diffusion coefficient [36,53]. This approach,\nwhile simplifying the mathematical model, does not capture the effects of non\nnegligible values of epsilon. When the Debye length is small but not\nnegligible, it may be very expensive to capture the small deviation from the\nQuasi-Neutral limit by standard methods in the literature. [...]",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to experimental\ndata recorded by the KASCADE experiment to reconstruct the mass composition of\ncosmic rays around the \\textit{knee} region. A set of four extensive air shower\nparameters sensitive to the primary particle mass ($LCm$, $N_{\\mu}$, $N_{e}$,\nand lateral shower $age$) was considered, whose coordinates were transformed\ninto a new orthogonal basis that maximally captures the data variance. Based on\nthe experimental distributions of the first two principal components (PCA0 vs.\\\nPCA1) and full Monte Carlo simulations of the KASCADE array considering five\ntypes of primary particles (p, He, C, Si, and Fe) and three hadronic\ninteraction models (EPOS-LHC, QGSjet-II-04, and SIBYLL~2.3d), we obtained the\nevolution of the abundance of each primary species as a function of energy, as\nwell as the evolution of the mean logarithmic mass with energy. We found that\nthe reconstruction of the mass composition resulting from this comprehensive\nanalysis significantly reduces dependence on the hadronic interaction model\nused in the simulation process, even though the initial input parameters are\nmodel-dependent. Moreover, the results support the idea that around the\n\\textit{knee} region, the abundance of the light component (protons) decreases,\nwhile the heavy component shows a slight increase. The evolution of $\\langle\n\\ln A \\rangle$ as a function of energy derived from this analysis shows\nexcellent agreement with recent results from the LHAASO--KM2A experiment and\naligns very well with the predictions of the data-driven GSF astrophysical\nmodel.",

However, automated data quality control faces\nunique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed\ndirectly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndata quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the\ntraining dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have\nsimilar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence\nof the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private\ndomains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative\ntraining fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data\nquality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the\nprivate data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner\nproducts as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality\ncontrol evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous\ndomain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected\nby our method can often outperform other data selection methods for\ncollaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in\nmedical, multilingual and financial settings.

In this paper\nwe approximate the Talanov solutions in the full dispersive equation using a\nsemiclassical soliton ensemble, a sequence of exact reflectionless solutions\nfor a corresponding sequence of values of the semiclassical parameter epsilon\ntending to zero, approximating the Talanov initial data more and more\naccurately in the limit as epsilon tends to zero. In this setting, we\nrigorously establish the validity of the dispersive saturation of the Talanov\nblowup obtained by Suleimanov. We extend the result to the full hierarchy of\nhigher focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, exhibiting new\ngeneralizations of the Talanov initial data that produce such dispersively\nregularized extreme focusing in both mixed and pure flows. We also argue that\ngeneric perturbations of the Talanov initial data lead to a different\nsingularity of the dispersionless limit, namely a gradient catastrophe for\nwhich the dispersive regularization is instead based on the tritronqu\\'ee\nsolution of the Painlev\\'e-I equation and the Peregrine breather solution which\nappears near points in space time corresponding to the poles of the former\ntranscendental function as shown by Bertola and Tovbis.",

Building on these findings, this paper\nintroduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both\nissues for high-quality talking head generation.

These artifacts vary between samples and cannot be corrected using\nstandard linear background subtraction or a measured reference substrate. To\naddress this, we develop and put forward a compensation scheme which combines\ntwo complementary, non-destructive measurement protocols. We demonstrate up to\n97% efficacy without requiring prior measurements of the bare substrate. The\nproposed framework enables reliable extraction of intrinsic magnetic signals\nand provides a general strategy for high-fidelity magnetometry in weakly\nmagnetic thin-film systems, including emerging classes of materials such as\ntopological phases and two-dimensional magnets. We also report the diamagnetic\nsusceptibility of crystalline MgO, chi_MgO = -4.0 x 10^-7 emu/g/Oe.",

    "abstract": "The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all\nmodality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite\nsignificant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the\ndeficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in\nsimultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level\nprediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo\nlabeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and\nexcluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,\nwe annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal\npseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,\nwhich can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event\ncombinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual\nmamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments\nand excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.\nOur extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art\nresults on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of\nvisual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics).

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling\ncomplex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal\ndistributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value\ndistributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in\nvalue function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper\nproposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D\n(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges\nof estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy\nrepresentations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that\ncan converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy\nentropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can\naccurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by\ngenerating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion\nmodel. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with\ndual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo\ntesting tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns\nmultimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all\n9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total\naverage return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream\nalgorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately\ncharacterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the\ndiffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.",

Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the\nsemantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role\nstructures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability.\nRecent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks\ndemonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive\nprior knowledge.

Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven\nsemantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient\nsemantic communication and collaborative reasoning.

Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing\nNetwork (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors\nwith MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection\nstrategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)\nenvironment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY\noutperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence\nspeed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative\nnavigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.",

    "abstract": "Dose-escalation trials in oncology drug development still today typically aim\nto identify 1-size-fits-all dose recommendations, as arbitrary quantiles of the\ntoxicity thresholds evident in patient samples. In the late 1990s efforts to\nindividualize dosing emerged fleetingly in the oncology trial methods\nliterature, but these have gained little traction due to a nexus of conceptual,\ntechnical, commercial, and regulatory barriers. To reduce the activation energy\nneeded for transforming current 1-size-fits-all dose-escalation trial designs\nto the dose-titration designs required for patient-centered dose\nindividualization, we demonstrate a categorical formulation of dose-escalation\nprotocols that extends readily to allow gradual introduction of dose titration.\n  Central to this formulation is a symmetric monoidal preorder on the\naccessible states of dose-escalation trials, embodying pharmacologic intuitions\nregarding dose-monotonicity of drug toxicity and ethical intuitions relating to\nthe therapeutic intent of such trials. A trial protocol that assigns doses to\nenrolling participants consistently with these intuitions is then a monotone\nmap from this preorder to the sequence of doses being trialed. We illustrate\nthis formulation by reference to the ubiquitous 3+3 dose-escalation design,\nwhich despite its many widely discussed flaws remains familiar to oncology\ntrialists and moreover has available an executable specification in Prolog.\nRemarkably, examined in light of our preorder the 3+3 protocol discloses a new\nflaw not previously described: a non-monotone dose recommendation. The right\nKan extension approximates this protocol from the side of safety, dissolving\nits triplet cohorts to allow incremental enrollment, and rectifying said\nnon-monotonicity. It also facilitates accelerated enrollment while toxicity\nassessments remain pending, as well as discretionary dose titration.",

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training\nimages, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial\ncamouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,\nprior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse\nviewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and\nadversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among\nGaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the\nimaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out\nnon-robust adversarial features.

Vazirani and Yannakakis [ICALP 1992] designed the first algorithm for\ncomputing an (s,t)-cut of second minimum capacity using $O(n^2)$ maximum\n(s,t)-flow computations. For directed integer-weighted graphs, we significantly\nimprove this bound by designing an algorithm that computes an $(s,t)$-cut of\nsecond minimum capacity using $O(\\sqrt{n})$ maximum (s,t)-flow computations\nw.h.p. To achieve this result, a close relationship of independent interest is\nestablished between $(s,t)$-cuts of second minimum capacity and global mincuts\nin directed weighted graphs.\n  2. Minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts have been studied quite well recently [Baswana,\nBhanja, and Pandey, ICALP 2022], which is a special case of second\n(s,t)-mincut.\n  (a) For directed multi-graphs, we design an algorithm that, given any maximum\n(s,t)-flow, computes a minimum+1 (s,t)-cut, if it exists, in $O(m)$ time.\n  (b) The existing structures for storing and characterizing all minimum+1\n(s,t)-cuts occupy $O(mn)$ space. For undirected multi-graphs, we design a DAG\noccupying only $O(m)$ space that stores and characterizes all minimum+1\n(s,t)-cuts.\n  3. The study of minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts often turns out to be useful in\ndesigning dual edge sensitivity oracles -- a compact data structure for\nefficiently reporting an (s,t)-mincut after insertion/failure of any given pair\nof query edges. It has been shown recently [Bhanja, ICALP 2025] that any dual\nedge sensitivity oracle for (s,t)-mincut in undirected multi-graphs must occupy\n${\\Omega}(n^2)$ space in the worst-case, irrespective of the query time.

A\ncareful design of these pulses can allow the refocusing of an ensemble at a\ndesired state, even if the ensemble experiences imperfections in the magnitude\nof the external field or resonance offsets. Since the introduction of CPs,\nseveral theoretical justifications for their robustness have been suggested. In\nthis work, we suggest another justification based on the classical mechanical\nconcept of a stability matrix. The motion on the Bloch Sphere is mapped to a\ncanonical system of coordinates and the focusing of an ensemble corresponds to\ncaustics, or the vanishing of an appropriate stability matrix element in the\ncanonical coordinates. Our approach highlights the directionality of the\nrefocusing of the ensemble on the Bloch Sphere, revealing how different\nensembles refocus along different directions. The approach also clarifies when\nCPs can induce a change in the width of the ensemble as opposed to simply a\nrotation of the axes. As a case study, we investigate the $90(x)180(y)90(x)$ CP\nintroduced by Levitt, where the approach provides a new perspective into why\nthis CP is effective.",

For these three groups, we determine\nthe harmonic strength and show the minimality and the uniqueness as spherical\ndesigns. In particular, the group $2O$ is unique as a minimal subset $X$ of the\n3-dimensional unit sphere with $T(X)=\\{22,14,10,6,4,2 \\}\\cup \\mathbb{O}^+$,\nwhere $\\mathbb{O}^+$ denotes the set of all positive odd integers.

For 6 CLAGN with a sufficiently low redshift and high\nenough mass, we rule out a Mrk 590-like flare. We find that at the population\nlevel, CLAGN have higher VAST/VLASS detection rates, lower fractions of radio\nloudness, and higher variability rates in the 1 GHz frequency compared to the\ncontrol AGN. Through VLA observations of radio SEDs and Magellan spectroscopic\nobservations, we do not find evidence of a link between CLAGN and AGN that\ntransitioned from radio-loud to radio-quiet in VLASS.

The resulting binary data is then encoded using perceptual\nillusions, such as the missing square paradox, to visually obscure the presence\nof encrypted content. Unlike conventional ciphers that rely solely on algebraic\ncomplexity, the Singularity Cipher introduces a dual-layer approach: symbolic\nencryption rooted in topology and visual steganography designed for human\ncognitive ambiguity. This combination enhances both cryptographic strength and\ndetection resistance, making it well-suited for secure communication,\nwatermarking, and plausible deniability in adversarial environments. The paper\nformalizes the architecture, provides encryption and decryption algorithms,\nevaluates security properties, and compares the method against classical,\npost-quantum, and steganographic approaches.

Even approaches that incorporate advanced\ntraining techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We\nhypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in\npreference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or\nlack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a\nlarge-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named\nSynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic\ntwo-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human\nannotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide\nverified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation\nbased on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce\nSkywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B\nparameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference\npairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile\nacross a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human\npreferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and\nbest-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major\nreward model benchmarks.

Similar to the rank, the\npermanental rank of a matrix is the size of the largest square submatrix with\nnonzero permanent (whose computation is #P-complete), while the permanental\nnullity is the multiplicity of zero as a root of the permanental polynomial. In\nthis paper, we prove a permanental analog of the rank-nullity theorem for any\nnon-negative symmetric matrix, positive semi-definite matrix and (-1, 0,\n1)-balanced symmetric matrices.",

We address challenges of\ncrowding in the inner region of the cluster and toward the SMC in DP1, and\ndemonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials\nto the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional\nsigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars\nselected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color\nspace matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the\n47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential\nsources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, of the\n72 well-characterized variables in the field, we recover five known variable\nstars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries, in the coadd-based\nobject catalog, and identify 62 in the difference image-based object catalog.\nAlthough the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to\nfollow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well.

    "abstract": "The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of\nseveral modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in\na display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic\nconsistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms\nneutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a\ncamera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any\nneutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across\nunseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\\sim$500\nparameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile\nCPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different\ncameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully\ncompatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal\ncomputational and memory overhead.",

Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,\nexternal reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with\nhuman motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box\ndeep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be\ninstalled in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the\nlearning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for\nestimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable\nmotion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as\nconstrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing\nground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration\nscheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform\nthe learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving\nthe estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink\ndataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force\nestimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our\nsimulated root trajectory precision.

GuideSep is\nconditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be\neasily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram\ndomain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior\napproaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning\nscheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and\napplicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the\nsame model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative\napproaches.

To solve these problems, we\nintroduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a\nsoft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points\ninto short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively\nfuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain\nthrough its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at\neach carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that\nsimultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and\nits centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an\nauxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates\ngradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban\nlayouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent\nsub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for\nfrequency-robust ISAC localization.",

However, how these planet-induced\nsubstructures affect the disk temperature, and how that in turn influences the\nsubstructures, remains unclear. We aim to study disk substructures and the\nthermal structure self-consistently and explore their impact on volatile\ndistribution. To this end, we perform iterative multi-fluid hydrodynamical and\nradiative transfer simulations of planet-disk interactions. We find that the\ntemperature in a structured disk deviates significantly from that of a smooth\ndisk due to giant planet formation. In particular, midplane temperatures in\ngaps can increase by tens of Kelvin, leading to volatile sublimation as well as\nradial shifts and multiplication of icelines. Comparing our multi-dust models\nwith previous gas-only models, we find that the former produces slightly\nshallower gaps and temperatures about 10 K ($\\sim25\\%$) higher. Furthermore,\nthe temperature at dust rings formed by pressure bumps can drop by several\nKelvin, creating volatile freeze-out regions. Nevertheless, the overall\nmidplane ice distribution is not strongly sensitive to whether dust is\nincluded. We also investigate the effect of varying disk viscosity. Increasing\n$\\alpha$ viscosity from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ leads to a roughly 10 K\n($\\sim25\\%$) warmer midplane due to enhanced vertical dust mixing. However,\nhigher viscosity suppresses gap opening and reduces the temperature enhancement\nwithin gaps. As a result, iceline locations do not follow a simple trend with\nviscosity. Finally, we propose an observational strategy using ALMA to test our\npredicted temperature changes within disk gaps.",

However, existing extraction frameworks built on top of TSR and OCR\nmethods often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results. To\nobtain highly accurate data for scientific domains, all extracted data must be\nmanually verified, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.

We explored various uncertainty scoring\nmethods to aggregate the uncertainties introduced by TSR and OCR. We rigorously\nevaluated the framework using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset\nconsisting of complex scientific tables in six scientific domains. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection, and\nby manually verifying only 47% of extraction results, the data quality can be\nimproved by 30%. Our work quantitatively demonstrates the role of UQ with the\npotential of improving the efficiency in the human-machine cooperation process\nto obtain scientifically usable data from complex tables in scientific\ndocuments.

However, with the growing\nadoption of word-level constructs in hardware verification, such as bit-vector\noperations, arithmetics and arrays, there lacks a counterpart of SAT sweeping\nat the word level. In this paper, we introduce SMT-Sweep, a novel extension of\nSAT sweeping into the word level, grounded in Satisfiability Modulo Theories\n(SMT). SMT-Sweep takes advantage of simulation and equivalence detection to\nhandle SMT terms with rich bit-vector operations and array semantics. Our\nframework incorporates both randomized and constraint-driven word-level\nsimulation tailored to symbolic expressions and operator semantics beyond pure\nBoolean logic. Experimental results show that SMT-Sweep achieves significant\nspeed-up compared to state-of-the-art bit-level SAT sweeping and word-level\nmonolithic SMT solving (averaging around 44x and 69x, respectively).To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that brings sweeping techniques to\nSMT-based hardware verification.

Traditionally, the known Kondo insulators are found in materials\nwith f-electrons. Recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) moire systems\nprovide a new approach to generate flat bands with strong electron correlation,\nwhich host localized moments at half filling. In this work, we demonstrate the\nrealization of a Kondo insulator phase in a moire superlattice of monolayer WS2\n/ bilayer WSe2 which hosts a set of moire flat bands in the WSe2 layer\ninterfacing the WS2 layer and dispersive bands in the other WSe2 layer. When\nboth WSe2 layers are partially doped but with a total density of two holes per\nmoire unit cell, an insulating state appears when the density of the moire band\nis below one hole per moire unit cell. The insulating state disappears above a\ncertain threshold magnetic field and the system becomes metallic, which is a\ntelltale signature of the Kondo insulator. The physics can be well explained by\na periodic Anderson lattice model that includes both the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion in the moire flat band and the hybridization between moire flat and\nnon-moire dispersive bands. Our results suggest that multilayer moire\nstructures of transition metal dichalcogenides provide a tunable platform to\nsimulate the Kondo insulator, which holds promise to tackle many critical open\nquestions in the Kondo insulators.",

We elaborate a scenario for the formation of\ndissipative multi-spot excitations (MSEs) in Kerr cavities, modeled by the one-\nand two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Lugiato-Lefever (LL) equations, which include a\nspatially periodic pump (SPP). First, we demonstrate that the SPP produces\nthree novel exact periodic solutions of the LL equation, expressed in terms of\nthe $\\mathrm{sn}$, $\\mathrm{cn}$, and $\\mathrm{dn}$ elliptic functions. By\nmeans of numerical methods, we explore the modulational instability (MI) and\ntransverse instability (TI) of the periodic states in 1D and 2D settings,\nrespectively. In the case of the defocusing nonlinearity, the 1D MI breaks the\nperiodic states into an array of spatiotemporal crescents. In the case of\nself-focusing, the 1D MI, initiated by small random perturbations, leads to\nestablishment of a chaotic state, with the amplitude statistics featuring a\nlong-tail probability distribution, that represents the presence of dissipative\nrogue waves. On the other hand, spatially periodic perturbations initiate\nformation of breather chains, which periodically disappear and reappear,\nresembling the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence. In the 2D regime, the TI\nresults in the formation of an array of 2D lumps.

The serpentine window\nsequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global\nvisual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine\nWindow Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping\nserpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for\nvascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM)\nintegrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity\nrepresentation.

Across single, double, and even triple lattices, as well as various\nnon-circular complex hole structures, POST enables prediction of multiple\noptical properties of photonic crystal layers in Photonic Crystal Surface\nEmitting Lasers (PCSELs) with high speed and accuracy, without requiring manual\nintervention, which serves as a comprehensive surrogate for the optical field\nsimulation. In the predictions of Quality Factor (Q) and Surface-emitting\nEfficiency (SE) for PCSEL, the R-squared values reach 0.909 and 0.779,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software\ndevelopment, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from\nplatforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local\ncodebase. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code\nwiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code\nwith suitable ones from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely\non heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively\nutilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of\nadaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an\nLLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an\norchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and\nperform context-aware substitutions. To balance efficiency and autonomy, the\nagent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common\npatterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent\nexploration. We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset\nconsisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios. Our approach achieves an\nexact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced\nLLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively,\nand surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep\nlearning by defining a \\textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}.

    "abstract": "Different strength of hydrodynamic instability can be induced by the\nvariations in the initial diffusion of shock bubble interaction (SBI), while\nthe influence of hydrodynamic instability on variable-density mixing in SBI\nremains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the hydrodynamic\ninstability of SBI through high-resolution numerical simulations. To isolate\neach factor within this instability, a circulation control method is employed\nto ensure consistent Reynolds number Re and Peclect number Pe. An examination\nof the morphology of the bubbles and vorticity dynamics reveals that the\nhydrodynamic instability can be characterized by positive circulation. Through\nvorticity budget analysis, the positive circulation is dominated by the\nbaroclinic torque. Therefore, the identified hydrodynamic instability is\nlabeled as secondary baroclinic hydrodynamic instability (SBHI). Based on the\ndimensional analysis of vorticity transport equation, a new dimensionless\nparameter, the secondary baroclinic vorticity (SBV) number, is proposed to\ncharacterize the strength of SBHI. Regarding mixing characteristics, cases with\nstronger SBHI exhibit higher mixing rates. Indicated by the temporal-averaged\nmixing rate with different SBV numbers, a scaling behavior is revealed: the\nmixing rate is increased proportionally to the square of SBV numbers. It is\nwidely recognized that unstable flow can also be induced by a high Reynolds\nnumber Re. The distinction and connection of SBHI and high Re unstable flow are\nfurther studied. The scaling behavior of the mixing rate in SBHI shows distinct\nfrom the Reynolds number Re scaling: the mixing can hardly be altered\neffectively in the limit of large Re, the mechanisms of which are inherently\ndifferent with respect to the stretch term, closely relating to the principal\nstrain and the alignment angle between the scalar gradient and the principal\nstrain axis.",

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method\nproduces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates\nsuperior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

This is because reducing\nthe dimensionality of any interacting physical system amplifies interaction\neffects that are beyond the reach of traditional hydrodynamic equations. In\nlow-dimensional water, hydrogen bonds can become stable enough to arrange water\nmolecules into an ordered state, causing water to behave not only like a liquid\nbut also like a solid in certain respects. In this review, we explore the\nrelationship between water's ordering and its ability to flow in\nlow-dimensional channels, using viscosities of bulk water, vapor, and ice as\nbenchmarks. We also provide a brief overview of the key theoretical approaches\navailable for such analyses and discuss ionic transport, which is heavily\ninfluenced by the molecular structure of water.",

However, the dynamic performance of GFL models\ncan be significantly impacted by the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in a weak grid,\nleading to instability due to inaccuracies in grid source phase angle\nestimation. The proposed method in this manuscript replaces the PLL with an\nAdvanced Angle Estimation based Kalman Filter including a Linear Quadratic\nRegulator (LQR) controller of the GFL. This method is robust in incorporating\ngrid impedance terms as part of state space models in the Kalman Filter\napproach to estimate instantaneous phase angle using {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}\nSynchronous Reference Frame equations. The stability performance of the\nproposed approach is validated through eigenvalue analysis in a two-source\ncase. Additionally, an LQR controller is employed to regulate capacitor\nvoltage, inverter current, and the current at the Point of Common Coupling\n(PCC). The proposed controller surpasses existing approaches in terms of\naccuracy and distortion reduction under abrupt grid impedance increases.\nMoreover, drop compensation is integrated into the Kalman Filter to enhance\nrobustness of the inverter against external oscillation disturbances from a\nsynchronous machine connected to the GFL via the PCC.

This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse\nActivation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve\nLLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based\npruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input\nactivations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By\nemploying a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve\nconsistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA\nis effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal\nperformance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for\nLLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a\nconsistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in\nzero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing\nTEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.",

One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer,\nprovide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies\n$PP\\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the\nanalogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \\neq NP$-has long\nbeen studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning\nin various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to\n$P \\neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for\nOWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of\nOWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution\nlearning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper\nquantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that\nfollows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution\nlearning can be derived from $PP \\neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to\naverage-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from\n$PP \\neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if\nworst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \\neq\nSampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite\nthat, we show that $PP \\neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of\nhardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \\neq BQP$ if and only if\nagnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard.\nAs a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning\nwith respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\\Sigma_3^P}$ learners\nimplies $SampBQP \\neq SampBPP$.",

    "abstract": "High-$Q$ optical nanocavities are fundamental to modern optics and photonics,\nenabling enhanced light-matter interactions. Previous studies have demonstrated\nthat high-$Q$ supercavity modes can be constructed within a single dielectric\nresonator by leveraging quasi-bound states in the continuum. However, their\n$Q$-factors are limited to few tens or hundreds when such a resonator is\nsubwavelength scale. Here, we propose a general recipe for achieving high-$Q$\nresonances with $Q>10,000$ in triple subwavelength dielectric resonators. This\nis realized through destructive interference between two resonant modes,\noptimized by structural tuning. Multipole analysis confirms that destructive\ninterference across radiation channels suppresses loss, forming the\nultrahigh-$Q$ states. These resonances can be efficiently excited by\nazimuthally polarized light due to improved mode overlap. As a key application,\nwe demonstrate efficient second harmonic generation under this excitation,\nachieving a conversion efficiency of $6.6\\%$ at an incident intensity of 0.78\nGW/cm$^2$. Our results may find exciting applications in developing\nultracompact photonic devices with superior performance.",

We ray-trace to produce\nsynthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the\nTDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical\nbut with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our\nsynthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt\nradio TDE observations.

Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for\nLMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn\nfine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we\nintroduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by\nintroducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for\nanalyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)\nLong-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then\nevaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal\nthat, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired\nthrough fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during\npre-training.

Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle\nRed Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined\nwith sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The\nresulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data\nanalytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and\ntemporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management\ndecisions.

This review addresses these gaps by\nsystematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor\nand platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and\nmodelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and\ndecision support tools).

To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the\ncounterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially,\ngiven two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than\n$B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$\nsuch that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of\n$A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always\nexist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte\nCarlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according\nto the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley\nvalues of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a\nseries of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating\ndifferential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and\nshifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm. Our\nexperimental results on real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our\nmethod and the effectiveness of counterfactuals in interpreting the Shapley\nvalue of an owner.",

Numerous intriguing observational results have been discovered,\nsome of which, such as the hard X-ray excess, and the associated variability\nbetween X-ray and very-high-energy (VHE) emissions, challenge the commonly\nadopted one-zone leptonic model. In this work, by establishing a time-dependent\nleptohadronic model, we explore whether the hard X-ray excess and the\nassociated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions could be interpreted by\nemission from hadronic interactions. Our modeling finds that for the hard X-ray\nexcess found in 2013, both of the secondary emissions from photohadronic and\nhadronuclear interactions could be a possible explanation for the hard X-ray\nexcess without introducing a super-Eddington jet power. The emission from the\nphotohadronic interactions contributes only to the hard X-ray band, while the\nhadronuclear interactions also predict VHE emissions associated with the hard\nX-rays. While for the hard X-ray excess found in 2016, only the secondary\nemissions from photohadronic interactions provide an interpretation at the cost\nof introducing a super-Eddington jet power. For the associated variability\nbetween X-ray and VHE emissions in 2017, we find that hadronic interactions\nfail to provide a possible interpretation.",

Surprisingly enough, it is exactly the\ncase. Extensive simulations, with both normal and non-normal distributions,\nsome of which are heavy tailed and/or highly skewed, and even discrete\ndistributions, are carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed test and to compare its performance with other tests.

    "abstract": "Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the\nrelationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However,\ntraditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires\nconsiderable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep\nlearning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient\nclassification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model\nachieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency\nearthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method.\nTo enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed,\nrevealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human\nexperts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled\nB-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and\nattention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and\naugmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and\ndiversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important\nrole in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings\nhighlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic\nearthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and\ninterpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and\nsubjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding\nseismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities\nfor transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced\nvolcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.",

An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.",

Observations onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at\nheliocentric distances below 50 Solar Radii (Rs) showed that within SBs,\nperturbations in the magnetic field ({\\Delta}B) and the bulk solar wind\nvelocity ({\\Delta}V) align, i.e., {\\Delta}B~{\\Delta}V, producing enhanced\nradial velocity spikes.

The results indicate that SB boundaries can be unstable\nfor generating KHI-driven surface waves, suggesting that the wave activity\nobserved at SB boundaries is caused by shear flow instabilities. In addition,\nthe continued development of KHI may lead to boundary erosion, contributing to\nthe radial evolution of SBs via structural weakening or broadening. However,\nwhen {\\Delta}B and {\\Delta}V are closely aligned, the boundary remains stable\nunless the velocity shear significantly exceeds the magnetic shear. Since the\nobserved velocity shear typically ranges from 40% to 90% of magnetic shear, the\ninstability condition is generally not satisfied. Thus, the configuration\nleading to the instability arises from deviations from precise alignment of\n{\\Delta}B and {\\Delta}V in the young solar wind, and the release of the KHI\npresumably leads to the formation of the {\\Delta}B and {\\Delta}V alignment\nobserved at SB boundaries located at 35-55 Rs.",
