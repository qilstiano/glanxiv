    "abstract": "We revisit the distributed counting problem, where a server must continuously\napproximate the total number of events occurring across $k$ sites while\nminimizing communication. The communication complexity of this problem is known\nto be $\\Theta(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon}\\log N)$ for deterministic protocols. Huang,\nYi, and Zhang (2012) showed that randomization can reduce this to\n$\\Theta(\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{\\epsilon}\\log N)$, but their analysis is restricted to\nthe {\\em oblivious setting}, where the stream of events is independent of the\nprotocol's outputs.\n  Xiong, Zhu, and Huang (2023) presented a robust protocol for distributed\ncounting that removes the oblivious assumption. However, their communication\ncomplexity is suboptimal by a $polylog(k)$ factor and their protocol is\nsubstantially more complex than the oblivious protocol of Huang et al. (2012).\nThis left open a natural question: could it be that the simple protocol of\nHuang et al. (2012) is already robust?\n  We resolve this question with two main contributions. First, we show that the\nprotocol of Huang et al. (2012) is itself not robust by constructing an\nexplicit adaptive attack that forces it to lose its accuracy. Second, we\npresent a new, surprisingly simple, robust protocol for distributed counting\nthat achieves the optimal communication complexity of\n$O(\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{\\epsilon} \\log N)$. Our protocol is simpler than that of\nXiong et al. (2023), perhaps even simpler than that of Huang et al. (2012), and\nis the first to match the optimal oblivious complexity in the adaptive setting.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the upwelling branch of the abyssal overturning\ncirculation is characterized by strong flows driven by turbulence along sloping\ntopography. The Boundary Layer Turbulence field campaign has provided direct\nevidence for strong upslope flows along a deep submarine canyon of the Rockall\nTrough. Turbulent overturning events spanning 200 m in the vertical were\nobserved every tidal cycle, suggesting that the strong tidal flows in the\ncanyon periodically undergo some form of instability. However, it is shown that\nthe flow never satisfied the classical instability condition for\ntime-independent sheared flows in a stratified fluid commonly used in\noceanographic studies to determine transition to turbulence. This study\nillustrates that the time dependence of the tidal flow changes the stability\nproperties and explains the observed transition to a turbulent state. The\nfindings suggest that turbulent mixing induced by oscillatory shear flow may be\nubiquitous over sloping topography and play an important role in deep ocean\nmixing that supports the global overturning circulation.",

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures\n(DMs) encoding the integrated column density of baryons, offer a unique window\ninto the distribution of gas. In this work, we investigate the constraining\npower of a 3x2-point correlation statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies. We present\nthe correlation formalism, derive covariance matrices and forecast\nsignal-to-noise ratios and Fisher parameter constraints. Assuming host galaxy\nDM variance of 90 pc cm$^{-3}$, for $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs across 35% of the sky,\nthe angular DM power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles $\\ell \\gtrsim\n20$ ($\\ell \\gtrsim 100$), which implies that the analysis can be conducted\nusing arcmin-scale localizations, where the redshift distribution of the FRB\npopulation can be modeled through the FRB luminosity function or FRB position\ncross-correlations with galaxies. We show that while $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRB DM\ncorrelations can constrain cosmological parameters at 40-70% (30-40%) level,\nthis is a factor of 2-3 (1.5-2) weaker than the precision attainable with\ngalaxy clustering alone due to shot noise from the limited FRB number density,\nvariance of the field and host DMs. On the contrary, feedback-sensitive scales\nare not accessible in galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that combining FRB DMs and\ngalaxies auto- and cross-correlations in a 3x2-point analysis breaks\nfeedback-cosmology degeneracies, yielding 10-18% (7-13%) precision on\ncosmological parameters and 3% (2%) constraints on feedback using $10^4$\n($10^5$) FRBs. This work positions the 3x2-point statistic of FRB DMs and\ngalaxies as a promising multi-probe strategy, bridging the gap between\nconstraining astrophysical feedback models and precise measurement of\ncosmological parameters.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of\nharmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they\neffectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning\nis forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target\npoint, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing\ninformation. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data\npoints whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance\n$\\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a\nframework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural\nnetworks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on\nthe order of $\\epsilon$, and when $\\epsilon$ is small enough, $\\epsilon^d$.\nMore generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging\nset measure decays as $\\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and\n$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.\nExtensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the\nsame asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing\nthat, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly\nsampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence\nthat adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning\nclaims can, in principle, be detected.",

    "abstract": "A/B testing is a widely adopted methodology for estimating conditional\naverage treatment effects (CATEs) in both clinical trials and online platforms.\nWhile most existing research has focused primarily on maximizing estimation\naccuracy, practical applications must also account for additional\nobjectives-most notably welfare or revenue loss. In many settings, it is\ncritical to administer treatments that improve patient outcomes or to implement\nplans that generate greater revenue from customers. Within a machine learning\nframework, such objectives are naturally captured through the notion of\ncumulative regret. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental trade-off\nbetween social welfare loss and statistical accuracy in (adaptive) experiments\nwith heterogeneous treatment effects. We establish matching upper and lower\nbounds for the resulting multi-objective optimization problem and employ the\nconcept of Pareto optimality to characterize the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for optimal experimental designs. Beyond estimating CATEs,\npractitioners often aim to deploy treatment policies that maximize welfare\nacross the entire population. We demonstrate that our Pareto-optimal adaptive\ndesign achieves optimal post-experiment welfare, irrespective of the\nin-experiment trade-off between accuracy and welfare. Furthermore, since\nclinical and commercial data are often highly sensitive, it is essential to\nincorporate robust privacy guarantees into any treatment-allocation mechanism.\nTo this end, we develop differentially private algorithms that continue to\nachieve our established lower bounds, showing that privacy can be attained at\nnegligible cost.",

With this information, we have built complete\nSEDs for the five sources, covering six decades of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. All targets except MN87 were detected at both wavelengths, with\nfeatures including compact sources, extended nebular emission, shells, and\nunrelated background structures. Spectral indices of compact sources are\nconsistent with thermal emission from stellar winds. We modelled the SEDs and\nsuccessfully reproduced the emission from stellar photospheres, circumstellar\ndust, thermal stellar winds and enshrouding HII regions. Our models, in\nagreement with previous literature results, reveal the presence of unresolved\nhot dust very close to the stars and provide the first estimates for the\nfundamental parameters of MN101.

This paper introduces\nan integrated 3D scanning and process simulation data-driven framework to\nminimize distortions of reverse-engineered additively manufactured components.\nThis framework employs iterative finite element simulations to predict\ngeometric distortions to minimize errors between the predicted and measured\ngeometrical deviations of the key dimensional characteristics of the part. The\neffectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by reverse engineering two\nInconel-718 components manufactured using laser powder bed fusion additive\nmanufacturing. This paper presents a remanufacturing process that combines\nreverse engineering and additive manufacturing, leveraging geometric\nfeature-based part compensation through process simulation. Our approach can\ngenerate both compensated STL and parametric CAD models, eliminating laborious\nexperimentation during reverse engineering. We evaluate the merits of STL-based\nand CAD-based approaches by quantifying the errors induced at the different\nsteps of the proposed approach and analyzing the influence of varying part\ngeometries.

    "abstract": "Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity,\narchitectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension\nlevel to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance.\nThese structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because\nflattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative\ninaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes\nthis challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of\nsuch networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the\nspinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and\nprescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts\nthe network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex\nlocations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into\narcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into\nprintable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D\nnetworks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)\nautomatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening\nprocess. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of\nviscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an\naverage element strain error of less than 1.0\\%. The method remains effective\nfor networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3\nMPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three\ncomplex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The\nprogrammable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact,\nintegrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting\nstructures in medical braces and splints.",

Given the ambition to\nexpand manned space exploration to distant destinations like Mars, it is\nessential to accurately predict the radiation doses astronauts are likely to\nencounter and the consequent biological impacts. Accurate dose predictions are\nimportant for operational radiation safety, ensuring risk assessments and\nprotective measures are properly calibrated to challenges of deep space travel.\nThe GCRsim facility at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory enables small animal\nradiobiology studies of GCR exposure, offering a controlled setting to mimic\nthe complex radiation conditions in deep space. This manuscript introduces Dose\nConversion Factors (DCFs) enabling rigorous absorbed dose calculations for mice\nirradiated at the GCRsim. A formalism was introduced for calculating\norgan-level and voxel-level radiation dose to a representative mouse phantom,\nbased on DCFs quantifying absorbed dose per unit fluence of different GCRsim\nspecies for various irradiation orientations. The PHITS Monte Carlo code was\nemployed to compute the DCFs in units of Gy m^2 ion^-1. A library of murine\nDCFs was derived using the PHITS Monte Carlo code for six irradiation\norientations: right-left, anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and their\nopposed variations. Absorbed doses to the murine total body were calculated and\ncompared with ion chamber measurements, which agreed within 10%. A library of\ndose conversion factors for mouse irradiation at GCRsim was developed and\nvalidated against measurements. These DCFs account for organ-specific\nvariations in radiation dose from different GCR species, enabling improved\nassessments of potential radiogenic effects and enhancing astronaut safety for\nfuture deep space missions.",

Examples of spatiotemporal beams include space-time wave packets,\nflying donuts, tilted pulse fronts, X-waves, Airy pulses, and spatiotemporal\noptical vortices. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a new class of\nspatiotemporal polarization states of light. We propose a generalized\nspatiotemporal higher-order Poincar\\'e sphere and show that these polarization\nstates emerge from the superposition of two orthogonal circular polarization\nstates, each carrying a spatiotemporal optical vortex. Such a choice of the\nbasis enables simultaneous control of the spatial and temporal degrees of\nfreedom of light.

The ability\nto create and manipulate diverse forms of spatiotemporal skyrmionic textures\nopens up new opportunities for studying complex light-matter interaction\nphenomena, advanced imaging and micromanipulation, and encoding information\nacross both space and time, with potential implications for advanced optical\ncommunication and information processing in classical and quantum domains",

Although its prediction\nset size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of\nevidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction\nset size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are\nlarger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of\nthis attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how\neffectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically\nthe inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform\nthis by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number\nof distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess\nthe similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use\nthree conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight\ndeep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations\nfrom multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per\ninstance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast\nmajority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak\ncorrelation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate\ncorrelation.

    "abstract": "Although asteroseismology is regarded as the most powerful tool for probing\nstellar interiors, seismic modelling remains dependent on global stellar\nparameters. Stellar clusters offer direct measurements of these parameters by\nfitting a CMD, making the application of asteroseismology in clusters a\nvaluable approach to advancing stellar physics modelling. We aimed to develop\nseismic modelling for gravity-mode pulsators in the open cluster NGC 2516 to\ndetermine stellar ages. We computed 1D stellar models using MESA, incorporating\nrotation-induced transport processes. Exponential overshooting was included, as\nwell as rotationally induced mixing in the radiative envelope. Grids of\nevolutionary models were computed covering isochrone-derived mass ranges. The\nmodels were evolved up to 300 Myr because of the cluster's young age (~100Myr).\nBy fitting the frequencies of identified modes of four gravity-mode member\npulsators simultaneously, we measure the seismic age of the cluster NGC 2516 as\n132+-8Myr. This high-precision seismic age estimate deviates by 1sigma from the\nisochronal age derived from public MIST isochrones for rotating stars. Our\nfindings show that seismic modelling strongly constrains core overshooting, but\nbecause the period spacing patterns are smooth, it provides weak constraints on\nmixing in the radiative envelopes. The two most massive gravity-mode pulsators\nhave MIST masses ~2.0M_sun while their seismic masses are 1.75M_sun. We\nconstructed new asteroseismology-calibrated isochrones using input physics\nidentical to that of our seismic model grid. While this resolves the age\ndiscrepancy, the mass discrepancy is only partially addressed. The remaining\nsmall yet persisting mass discrepancy implies a mismatch between the physics in\ncore to surface environments of 1D stellar models and the seismic observables\nprobing those areas of fast-rotating stars.",

We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in\nthe $n^{\\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth\ntest functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2n},\n\\frac{1}{2n}\\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level\ncalculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold\nproducts of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and\nReno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We\nthen perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their\ncontributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\\text{th}}$ centered\nmoments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we\nuse to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis,\nfacilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything\nModel (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide\nrange of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally\ndeterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail\nto capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This\nlimitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple\nplausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert\nvariability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic\nextension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on\nboth the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and\ntraining with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and\nplausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.\nThe architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM\nframework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during\ninference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,\nenabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate\nProbabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate\nits ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,\noutperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.\nOur code is available at: https://github.com/tbwa233/Probabilistic-SAM/.",

    "abstract": "The sterile insect technique has emerged recently as a biologically secure\nand effective tool for suppressing wild mosquito pests. To improve the\nperformance of this strategy, understanding the interaction between wild and\nsterile mosquitoes is critical. Although the common models for this biological\nproblem are scalar equations, they are remarkably resistant to the mathematical\nanalysis. In a series of papers, Due\\~nas, Nu\\~nez, and Obaya have developed a\npowerful approach to describe the dynamical behavior of scalar equations with\nd-concave nonlinearities, a property typically related to the sign of the third\nderivative. In this paper, we show that, for periodic equations coming from\npopulation dynamics, this condition is typically associated with the positive\nsign of the third derivative of the inverse of the Poincar\\'e map. This remark\nallows us to simplify some arguments in the periodic case and obtain a deep\ngeometrical understanding of the global bifurcation patterns. Consequently, the\ndynamical behavior of the models is analyzed in terms of simple and testable\nconditions. Our methodology allows us to describe precisely the dynamical\nbehavior of the common mosquito population suppression models, even\nincorporating seasonality.

To capture the BH shadow images, we utilise a recent fisheye camera model\nand ray-tracing procedures. In this view, we carefully addressed the influence\nof the spin parameter $a$ and the hair parameter $h$ on the BH shadow images.\nThe results indicate that for smaller values of $h$, the BH shadow contours\nshift noticeably towards the right side of the screen, while for larger values\nof $h$, the nearly circular shadow gradually deforms into a ``D'' shape\nprofile. For a celestial light source, the larger values of $h$ lead to a\nreduction in the corresponding radius of the photon ring, while the\nspace-dragging effect becomes more pronounced with increasing $a$. We further\ndiscuss the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and\nretrograde accretion disk scenarios. The results reveal that variations in $h$\nsignificantly affect both the inner shadow and the resulting Einstein ring.\nSubsequently, we also discussed the distinct features of red-shift\nconfigurations on the disk for both direct and lensed images, which are closely\nrelated to the accretion flow and the relevant parameters.

To\ninvestigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal\nintervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments\nof one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)\nduring the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:\ninjecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm\nsemantics suppresses crashes and restores stability.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of microservices architecture in modern software\nsystems has emphasized the need for efficient management of distributed\nservices. While stateless microservices enable straightforward migration,\nstateful microservices introduce added complexity due to the need to preserve\nin-memory state during migration. However, most container orchestrators,\nincluding Kubernetes, lack native support for live stateful service migration.\nThis paper proposes an optimized migration scheme for stateful services in\nKubernetes by integrating the Message-based Stateful Microservice Migration\n(MS2M) framework with Kubernetes' Forensic Container Checkpointing (FCC)\nfeature. Key enhancements include support for migrating StatefulSet-managed\nPods and the introduction of a Threshold-Based Cutoff Mechanism to handle high\nincoming message rates. Evaluation results demonstrate that MS2M for individual\nPods reduces downtime by 96.986% compared to cold migration methods, while the\nStatefulSet approach provides greater flexibility in managing stateful\nservices. These insights provide practical strategies for optimizing stateful\nmicroservice migration in cloud-native environments.",

While these systems are known for\ntheir efficiency, they also face complex challenges in service optimization,\nespecially in maintaining end-to-end quality of service across dynamically\ndistributed services. This paper introduces a novel approach using the concept\nof Service Affinity to address this challenge. The proposed method, termed\nService Affinity Graph-based Approach, employs a graph-based model to model the\ninteractions among microservices. It formulates the service placement as a\nminimum-weight k-cut problem and utilizes an approximation algorithm for\nservice clustering. This approach is realized through a conceptual framework\nthat takes into account a wide range of optimization objectives, ranging from\nenhancing application performance and enforcing data privacy to optimizing\noperational costs.

    "abstract": "When developing scientific machine learning (ML) approaches, it is often\nbeneficial to embed knowledge of the physical system in question into the\ntraining process. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant\nchallenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The\ntest case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known\nTransparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on\nthe cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the\nresults show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly\nimproved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and\nmean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between\npreserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy.",

Previous approaches using forward\nprojection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing\nbackward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In\nthis paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel\ncamera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB\n(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based\nview transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to\nmitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates\nperspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth\ndistinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but\nunreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth\ninformation from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention\nwith a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the\ncomprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our\nproposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward\nprojection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\\% NDS and 54.0\\% mAP in\n3D object detection.",

We introduce in this paper the\nfirst two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,\nnarrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art\nmethods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel\ncomponents that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,\nwe introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D\nvoxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D\nconvolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels\ncan be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a\nseparable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using\n3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context\nfeature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a\nsparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,\nand fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object\nproposals.

Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which\nrecomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into\ndual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs\nare integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic\nbalance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency\nof our proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the\nrobustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ\nsignificantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable\npredictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable\nOOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of\nthese techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows\nresearchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to\nidentify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has\nproven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the\nperformance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular\ncharacteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable\nevaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework\nfor robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the\nreliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to\neffectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for\ntheir differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using\na conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based\non their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class\nhierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy\nto obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.\nThis framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution\nDetection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we\nselected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without\noutlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast\nconvergence to the true performance.",

Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained\nby the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of\ninscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large\nmultimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering\nOBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed\nto evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It\nincludes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over\n15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to\ninvestigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in\nvisual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary\nvisual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual\ninformation, while most of the time they are limited by language priors.

Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat\nforecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors\nto cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors\nrather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning\n(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and\noptimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily\non synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their\npractical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional\nchallenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection\nconstraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work\nleverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations\nand improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework\nsuitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while\noptimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on\na novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods\nagainst PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL\nyields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the\nperformance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without\nAFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in\nreal-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and\nreduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic\nbenefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar\nchallenges.",

    "abstract": "The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return\ncontemporaneously \\emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral\nportfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this\ninterpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \\to R_{i,t}$\nconflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its\nconstituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator\ncontradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the\nadmissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$,\nand an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \\emph{fork}, $Z \\to\n\\{R_m, R_i\\}$, not $R_m \\to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a\ncausal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the\nunderlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain\nexposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import\nindex-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\\ equity data, we\nshow that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any\ngenuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with\nmodest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be\nread as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed\nfactor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for\nwhat remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.",

Current safety measures struggle to\npreserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined\nadversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use\nfull-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we\nintroduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be\nresistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary\nhypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nweights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender\nLLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these\nadversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We\nvalidate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,\nincluding jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct\nweight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\\% more robust against adversarial\nattacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines.

For a Unruh-deWitt (UDW) detector in $n$-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that its irreversible thermalization to a\nGibbs equilibrium state follows distinct trajectories on the Bloch sphere,\nwhich depend on the types of fields the detector interacts with, as well as the\nspacetime dimensionality. Using thermodynamic process functions, particularly\nquantum coherence and heat that form the quantum First Law, we characterize the\nUnruh thermalization through a complementary time evolution between the\ntrajectory-dependent rates of process functions. Grounded in information\ngeometry, we further explore the kinematics of the detector state as it \"flows\"\nalong the trajectory. In particular, we propose two heating/cooling protocols\nfor the UDW detector undergoing Unruh thermalization. We observe a quantum\nMpemba-like effect, characterized by faster heating than cooling in terms of\nUhlmann fidelity \"distance\" change. Most significantly, we establish the\nmaximum fidelity difference as a novel diagnostic that essentially\ndistinguishes between Unruh thermalization and its classical counterpart, i.e.,\nclassical thermal bath-driven thermalization of an inertial UDW detector. This\ncompelling criterion may serve as a hallmark of the quantum origin of the Unruh\neffect in future experimental detection and quantum simulation. Finally, we\nconclude with a general analysis of Unruh thermalization, starting from\nequal-fidelity non-thermal states, and demonstrate that the detectors' fidelity\nand \"speed\" of quantum evolution still exhibit a Mpemba-like behavior.",

Although several paradigms (seed selection, incremental insertion,\nneighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer)\nhave been employed to design in-memory graph-based vector search algorithms, a\nsystematic comparison of the key algorithmic advances is still missing. We\nconduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art\nmethods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We\nshare key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g.,\nthe best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and\nneighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt\nscalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the\nimportance of devising more sophisticated data adaptive seed selection and\ndiversification strategies.",

    "abstract": "Ionic liquid (IL) gating has emerged as a powerful tool to control the\nstructural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by\ndriving ion motion at solid interfaces. In magneto-ionic systems, electric\nfields are used to move ions, typically oxygen, from a donor layer into an\nunderlying magnetic metal. Although oxygen distribution is key to enabling\nprecise and stable control in magneto-ionic systems, the spatial distribution\nand voltage-dependence of oxygen incorporation in such nanoscale stacks remain\nunknown. Here, we quantify oxygen depth profiles and oxide formation in Si/\nSiO2/ Ta (15)/ HfO2 (t) films after IL gating as a function of the gate voltage\nand HfO2 capping thickness (2 and 3 nm). X-ray reflectivity and X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed a threshold electric field of\n~ -2.8 MV/cm to initiate oxygen migration from HfO2 into metallic Ta. The\nresulting Ta2O5 thickness increases linearly with gate voltage, reaching up to\n4 nm at -3 V gating. Notably, the required electric field rises with oxide\nthickness, indicating a progressively growing barrier for thicker oxide films.\nThe Ta/Ta2O5 interface remains atomically sharp for all gate voltages. This\nsuggests that complete Ta2O5 layers form sequentially before further oxygen\npenetration, with no sign of deeper diffusion into bulk Ta. Thinner capping\nlayers enhance oxidation, relevant for optimized stack design. Additionally,\nindium migration from the indium tin oxide electrode to the sample surface was\nobserved, which should be considered for surface-sensitive applications.

In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two\npeople's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically\nconsistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger\nspace. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which\nis composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and\ncoherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For\neach sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and\ncollaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity.

We also\ndemonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates\ninteractive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.\nOur method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also\npropose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial\nexpressions.

The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect\ntrajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or\ntraining on offline datasets.

However, the effects of online vs. offline data on\nworld models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been\nthoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both\nparadigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different\nenvironments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline\ncounterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of\noffline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This\nissue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,\noffline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between\nthe agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We\ndemonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online\ninteractions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of\nonline training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that\nincorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of\noffline agents.

    "abstract": "Non-linearities are a key feature allowing non-classical control of quantum\nharmonic oscillators. However, when non-linearities are strong, designing\nprotocols for control is often difficult, placing a barrier to exploiting these\nproperties fully. Here, using a single trapped-ion oscillator operated in the\nstrongly non-linear regime of the atom-light interaction, we show how to\ngenerate localized multi (2, 3, 4, and 5)-component Schr\\\"odinger's cat\nmanifolds using a novel form of non-linear reservoir engineering. We then\nspecifically select Hamiltonians which allow us to perform measurements on\nthese state manifolds. To our knowledge, our work is the first experimental use\nof such high order non-linear processes for control of non-classical states of\na quantum harmonic oscillator, opening up a new toolbox which can be applied to\nbosonic quantum error correction, computation, and sensing.",

    "abstract": "Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a promising quantum algorithm for obtaining\nmolecular ground-state energies with chemical accuracy. However, its\ncomputational cost, dominated by the Hamiltonian 1-norm $\\lambda$ and the cost\nof the block encoding, scales at least quadratically with the number of\nmolecular orbitals, making it challenging to incorporate dynamic correlation by\nenlarging the active space. In this work, we investigate two strategies to\nmitigate this cost through the optimization of the basis set. First, we\ninvestigate whether adjusting the coefficients of Gaussian basis functions can\nminimize the 1-norm while preserving the accuracy of the ground state energy.\nAlthough this method leads to a reduction in the 1-norm up to 10%, this\nreduction is system-dependent and diminishes with increasing molecular size.\nSecond, we demonstrate that employing a large-basis-set frozen natural orbital\n(FNO) strategy results in a substantial reduction in QPE resources without\ncompromising accuracy. We study a dataset of 58 small organic molecules and the\ndissociation curve of N2, and demonstrate that an active space constructed from\norbitals derived from larger basis sets captures correlation effects more\neffectively. This approach yields up to an 80% reduction in the 1-norm\n$\\lambda$ and also leads to a 55% reduction in the number of orbitals. Our\nresults highlight that improving the quality, not just the size, of the orbital\nbasis is a viable strategy for extending QPE to include dynamical correlation,\nmaking progress toward scalable and chemically accurate quantum simulations\nwith tractable resource requirements.",

This paper presents a pretrained quantum\ncontext-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive\nword embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn\ncontextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native\ncontext learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic\ntasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix\ncomputation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based\non their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and\ntested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as\nexponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based\ntransformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain\ncontext sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks\nwhere the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable\nresources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated\ncontext matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a\nlow-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of\nslightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures\ncontext sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems\nfor representing rich, context-aware language information.

First, we contribute to\nthe already known theory of such evolutions. We establish a sufficient\ncondition for drivers in the $C^1$-class to create a two-sided simple curve. By\nconstructing a counterexample in the $C^0$-class, we demonstrate that the same\ncondition is not necessary and discuss an alternative necessary and sufficient\ncondition for $C^0$-drivers that create two-sided curves.\n  Second, we analyze the evolutions driven by the one-parameter family of\ncomplex linear drivers $\\{ct\\}_{c \\in \\mathbb C}$. We show that the geometries\nof the generated hulls differ significantly from the chordal real-driven case.\nAlthough each complex linear driver creates a two-sided curve, the geometry of\nthe generated curve exhibits three distinct geometric phases depending on the\ncomplex parameter $c$: a simple phase, a simple with one end spiraling phase,\nand a third new exotic variant. In this exotic phase, one part of the curve is\nsimple while the other part forms a Jordan curve rooted at the origin. After\nforming the Jordan curve, this part ceases to grow while disconnecting an open\nset of positive area from infinity for arbitrarily large times.

The proposed method provides time-domain sound\nfield estimates that can be computed in closed form, are guaranteed to be\nphysically realizable, and for which time-domain properties of the sound fields\ncan be exploited to improve estimation performance. Exploiting prior\ninformation on the time-domain behaviour of room impulse responses, the\nestimation performance of the proposed method is shown to be improved using a\ntime-domain data weighting, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed\napproach. It is further shown using both simulated and real data that the\ntime-domain data weighting can be combined with a directional weighting,\nexploiting prior knowledge of both spatial and temporal properties of the room\nimpulse responses. The theoretical framework of the proposed method enables\nsolving a broader class of sound field estimation problems using kernel ridge\nregression where it would be required to consider the time-domain response\nrather than the frequency-domain response of each frequency separately.",

This detector prototypes a new modular\ndesign for a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC), comprised of a\ntwo-by-two array of four modules, each further segmented into two\noptically-isolated LArTPCs. The 2x2 Demonstrator features a number of\npioneering technologies, including a low-profile resistive field shell to\nestablish drift fields, native 3D ionization pixelated imaging, and a\nhigh-coverage dielectric light readout system. The 2.4 tonne active mass\ndetector is flanked upstream and downstream by supplemental solid-scintillator\ntracking planes, repurposed from the MINERvA experiment, which track ionizing\nparticles exiting the argon volume. The antineutrino beam data collected by the\ndetector over a 4.5 day period in 2024 include over 30,000 neutrino\ninteractions in the LAr active volume-the first neutrino interactions reported\nby a DUNE detector prototype. During its physics-quality run, the 2x2\nDemonstrator operated at a nominal drift field of 500 V/cm and maintained good\nLAr purity, with a stable electron lifetime of approximately 1.25 ms. This\npaper describes the detector and supporting systems, summarizes the\ninstallation and commissioning, and presents the initial validation of\ncollected NuMI beam and off-beam self-triggers. In addition, it highlights\nobserved interactions in the detector volume, including candidate muon\nanti-neutrino events.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal\nchallenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena\nprimarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other\nlate-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a\nnovel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM\nproperties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing\nthe gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM\nparticles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D\npower spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method\nfor constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the\nearly universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this\nwork, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D\npower spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that\nastrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes.\nUnder low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could\nconstrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to\n$\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\sim {10^{-31}}\\,{\\rm cm^{3}\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\tau \\sim\n{10^{30}}\\,{\\rm s}$ for ${10}\\,{\\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with\nmasses $\\sim {10^{15}}\\,{\\rm\\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\\mathrm{PBH}} \\simeq\n10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude\nover current limits.

The approach uses a hierarchical\nsampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving\nadaptability to complex obstacle distributions.

However, how to automatically\napply the high-level knowledge in CTI reports in realistic attack detection\nsystems, such as provenance analysis systems, is still an open problem. The\nchallenge stems from the semantic gap between the knowledge and the low-level\nsecurity logs: while the knowledge in CTI reports is written in natural\nlanguage, attack detection systems can only process low-level system events\nlike file accesses or network IP manipulations. Manual approaches can be\nlabor-intensive and error-prone.\n  In this paper, we propose KnowHow, a CTI-knowledge-driven online provenance\nanalysis approach that can automatically apply high-level attack knowledge from\nCTI reports written in natural languages to detect low-level system events. The\ncore of KnowHow is a novel attack knowledge representation, gIoC, that\nrepresents the subject, object, and actions of attacks. By lifting system\nidentifiers, such as file paths, in system events to natural language terms,\nKnowHow can match system events to gIoC and further match them to techniques\ndescribed in natural languages. Finally, based on the techniques matched to\nsystem events, KnowHow reasons about the temporal logic of attack steps and\ndetects potential APT attacks in system events. Our evaluation shows that\nKnowHow can accurately detect all 16 APT campaigns in the open-source and\nindustrial datasets, while existing approaches all introduce large numbers of\nfalse positives. Meanwhile, our evaluation also shows that KnowHow reduces at\nmost 90% of node-level false positives while having a higher node-level recall\nand is robust against several unknown attacks and mimicry attacks.",

This question is critical\nbecause embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers\nmatter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share\ngrew by 2\\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market\nshare grew by 20\\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This\nstudy aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.\nUsing synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text\nembedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical\ndetails accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding\nnumeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP\nsystems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.",

    "abstract": "Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep\nlearning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road\nnetworks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate\nrepresentation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The\nperformance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more\nfrom incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in\ncomplex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the\nmost competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework\nfor developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights\ndistinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow\nheterogeneity of spatial interactions.",

The aim of this work is to determine the maximum ages that can be\nunambiguously established for $\\delta$ Sct stars using seismic observables,\nand, by extension, the oldest open clusters that can be dated using this type\nof star. Methods. I estimate the large frequency separation using various\ntechniques applied to two samples of $\\delta$ Sct located near the red edge of\nthe instability strip. One sample consists of 18 targets observed by the Kepler\nmission, and the other comprises 17 targets observed by TESS. I employ a grid\nof stellar models representative of typical $\\delta$ Sct parameters,\nincorporating mass, metallicity, and rotation as independent variables, and\ncompute the first eight radial modes for each model. Using the observed\nspectroscopic temperature, and the estimated large separation, I estimate the\nage of each star by fitting a weighted probability density function to the age\ndistribution of the models that best match the seismic constraints. Results. To\nevaluate the performance of the fitting method, it was applied to a synthetic\npopulation of 20 $\\delta$ Sct stars with varying metallicities and ages,\ngenerated by randomly selecting models. The analysis indicates that $\\delta$\nSct stars older than 1 Gyr, but still prior to reaching the terminal-age main\nsequence, can in principle be reliably age-dated. Nevertheless, when the method\nis applied to the observational sample, only three out of the 35 stars\nconsidered marginally exceed an estimated age of 1 Gyr. Conclusions. From these\nresults, I can say that open clusters older than approximately 1 Gyr cannot be\nreliably dated using astero-seismology of $\\delta$ Sct stars with 1D models, at\nleast not without a more complete treatment of convection and a non-linear\ntreatment of rotation.",

    "abstract": "Ray antenna array (RAA) was recently proposed as a novel multi-antenna\narchitecture that arranges multiple massive cheap antenna elements into simple\nuniform linear arrays (sULAs) with different orientations. Compared with\ntraditional architectures like hybrid analog/digital beamforming with uniform\nlinear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA), RAA has several promising\nadvantages such as significantly reduced hardware cost, higher beamforming\ngains and the ability of providing uniform angular resolution for all\ndirections. In this paper, we propose a full-angle RAA architecture and an\ninnovative omnicell wireless communication paradigm enabled by full-angle RAA.\nThe proposed full-angle RAA expands RAA's orientation angle to the full angle\ndomain, such that the RAA's advantages can be exploited to all directions. This\nfurther enables the new concept of omnicell wireless communication system, with\nthe base station equipped by full-angle RAA and deployed at the center of each\ncell. Compared to the conventional cell sectoring wireless communication\nsystem, the proposed omnicell system is expected to not only significantly\nreduce the inter-user interference, but also improve the cost efficiency.\nExtensive analytical and numerical results are provided to compare those key\nperformance indicators such as the spatial resolution and the communication\nrate of the proposed full-angle RAA based omnicell wireless communication\nsystem against the conventional ULA/UCA-based cell sectoring systems.",

Second, we adopt the perspective of an insurance company issuing\nunit-linked policies written on this fund.

Due to\nmarket incompleteness, we address the hedging problem via a quadratic approach\naimed at minimizing the tracking error.

Traditional centralized deep learning\napproaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network\nlatency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses\nprivacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still\nhas to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and\ndifferential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal\nFederated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse\nsensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple\naccelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through\nresidual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via\nattention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused\nembeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy\nsafeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with\nup to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and\nfederated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed\nunder differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses\nMultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on\nthe privacy budget and setting.

Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which\nhampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be\nunsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is\noften not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to\nmaximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between\nanomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance\nof DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of\nmislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings\nindicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others\nappear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real\nworld, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and\nthe number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query\nstrategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of\nmislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an\nactive learning-based threshold is recommended.",

    "abstract": "In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by\n\"pileup\", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of\ninterest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as\nconservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate\nhow such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided\ninductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:\nrather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether\nphysics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.\n  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with\nconservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted\nInductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which\nintegrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at\n$\\sigma\\in\\{15,25,50,75,100\\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard\nbaselines, while WIPUNet shows a \\emph{widening margin} at higher noise.\nComplementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting\nphysics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models\ndegrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles\ninto modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)\ndemonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA\nmachinery.",

Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene\ngraphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and\nhuman-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual\ncues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby\nlimiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such\ncommonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the\nobjects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples\nthe SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to\nconvert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based\nmodel is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work\nis on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation\n(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA\ndiscussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method\n(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances\nand disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we\nevaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,\nGPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome\nannotations.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding\nsolutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method\nas a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.\nHowever, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly\nsimilar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address\nquestions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not\nexplicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific\nsense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the\nquestion and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The\nLLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing\nit to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,\nwe extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or\nhidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond\nconventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our\nscope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable\nsolutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.",

In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic\nband touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac\nnodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT,\nour self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate\ninteractions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a\nquantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number.\nInterestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries,\nleading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the\nstandard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice\nsymmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic\n(BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the\nHartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac\nnodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential.\nHowever, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed\nwhile the BNDS phase grows stronger.",

    "abstract": "Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe\nrover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.\nStereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing\nscene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.\nState-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local\nblock-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities\nvia smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with\nlow-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers\nonly limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene\ncontext. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based\nrefinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.\nThe approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware\nsegmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has\nbeen evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,\nthe terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in\nsloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in\nraw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and\nedges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the\nmethod's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps\nand more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous\nnavigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and\nfull-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling\nprocess, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D\nnavigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in\nfuture planetary exploration missions.",

The inherent intractability, non-existence, or\nnon-uniqueness of their solutions, and the need for swift exploration of the\nsolution space necessitate the adoption of machine learning and data-driven\napproaches, such as deep generative models. Here, we show that both deep\ngenerative model-based and optimization-based methods can yield unreliable\nsolutions or incomplete coverage of the solution space. To address this, we\npropose the Generative and Uncertainty-informed Inverse Design (GUIDe)\nframework, leveraging probabilistic machine learning, statistical inference,\nand Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to generate designs with targeted\nnonlinear behaviors. Unlike inverse models that directly map response to\ndesign, i.e., response $\\mapsto$ design, we employ a design $\\mapsto$ response\nstrategy: a forward model that predicts each design's nonlinear functional\nresponse allows GUIDe to evaluate the confidence that a design will meet the\ntarget, conditioned on a target response with a user-specified tolerance level.\nThen, solutions are generated by sampling the solution space based on the\nconfidence.

Here we report the discovery of a set of\ndistinctive properties that rule the temporal and spectral evolution of GRB\n230307A, a LGRB with evidence for a COM origin. Specifically, the sequence of\npulses that make up its profile is characterised by an exponential evolution of\n(i) flux intensities, (ii) waiting times between adjacent pulses, (iii) pulse\ndurations, and (iv) spectral peak energy. Analogous patterns are observed in\nthe prompt emission of other long COM candidates. The observed evolution of\ngamma-ray pulses would imply that a relativistic jet is colliding with more\nslowly expanding material.

    "abstract": "AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of\nthe law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination\nlaw. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the \"less\ndiscriminatory alternative\" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,\nmodel) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves\ncomparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.\nNotably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant\n(the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI\ncases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet\nhigh-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most\nlitigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to\ntheir model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to\nreproduce a similar model from scratch.\n  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an\nLDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model\naccess. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic\nparity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we\nprovide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier\n(PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the \"low-resource\nregime,\" then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being\ncontested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus\nserves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the\nclaimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the\nclaimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small)\nmodels. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling\nlaw holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about\ntheir potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To\naddress these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.\nHowever, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to\nrobustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image\nquality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW\nconcepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or\ncelebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright\nand legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close\ndistances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained\nmanipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel\nmethod specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in\neasing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing\nthe concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference\nsubspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the\ntarget concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct\nextensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity\nerasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results\nwith current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality\ncomparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results\nthat are on par with methods targeting completeness.",

Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled\ntext-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal\napproaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions.\nTraditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category\nclassification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced\nidentical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved\naccuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data.\nAnalysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached\n42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x\nabove random). Identical actions such as \"help the merchant\" cannot reveal\nwhether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to\nreasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results\nconfirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains\nunexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling.\nBehavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal\nintegration enables 25%.

Most solar\nfeature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted\napplicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in\nengineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven\napproaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena.

We evaluated GestoBrush with six graffiti\nartists and findings suggested that embodied AR interactions supporting artists\nbypass real-world constraints and explore new artistic possibilities, whose AR\nartworks created enhanced senses of intuitiveness, immersion, and\nexpressiveness.

In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of\nPBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood\nanalytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and\nreproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the\nPBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some\nearlier studies. Slightly above $10^{9}$ g, the BBN sensitivity rapidly\nincreases with the mass and then decreases, with the turning point occurring at\n$2\\times10^{9}$ g. For PBHs in the mass range $[10^{9},\\ 10^{10}]$ g, current\nmeasurements of BBN observables set an upper bound on the initial mass fraction\nparameter $\\beta$ ranging from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-19}$.

To address these challenges, we\nperform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose\na unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based\nmultimodal learning methods.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to\ndeploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated\nby LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy\nrationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no\nadditional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to\ncapture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the\nquality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness\nPerception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of\nthe student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.\nFirstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the\nstudent model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them\nwhen they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning\nand allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a\nCorrectness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of\neach training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the\nanswer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the\nrationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have\nshown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.",

Due to the\nColeman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global\nsymmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem,\nwe consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global\nsymmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary\noperators in the fundamental and adjoint representations.

Also, increasing the level\n$k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration.\nOn the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may\nsuggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.",

Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,\na major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.\nSecond, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need\nto perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of\nsharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can\ntake minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in\npractice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh\noptimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel\nre-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and\nintersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;\n(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free\nguarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the\nsimplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by\nre-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k\ntriangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090.

    "abstract": "Scientific breakthroughs typically emerge through the surprising violation of\nestablished research ideas, yet quantifying surprise has remained elusive\nbecause it requires a coherent model of all contemporary scientific worldviews.\nDeep neural networks like large language models (LLMs) are arbitrary function\napproximators tuned to consistently expect the expressions and ideas on which\nthey were trained and those semantically nearby. This suggests that as LLMs\nimprove at generating plausible text, so the perplexity or improbability a text\nsequence would be generated by them should come to better predict scientific\nsurprise and disruptive importance. Analyzing over 2 million papers across\nmultiple disciplines published immediately following the training of 5\nprominent open LLMs, here we show that higher perplexity scores systematically\npredict papers that receive more variable review ratings, longer editorial\ndelays, and greater reviewer uncertainty. The most perplexing papers exhibit\nbimodal outcomes: disproportionately represented among the most celebrated\nscientific achievements and also the most discounted. High-perplexity papers\ntend to be published in journals with more variable impact factors and receive\nfewer short-term citations but in prestigious venues that bet on long-term\nimpact. They also generate more interdisciplinary engagement portending\nlong-term influence, and are more likely to have been supported by speculative\nfunders like DARPA versus the NIH. Interestingly, we find the opposite pattern\nfor humanities research, where the least surprising work is the most celebrated\nand cited. Our findings reveal that computational measures of corpus-wide\nlinguistic surprise can forecast the reception and ultimate influence of\nscientific ideas, offering a scalable approach to recognize and generate\npotentially transformative research that challenge conventional scientific\nthinking.",

In this work,\nwe demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson\njunction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by\nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits\npronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as\nthe chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it.

Although obvious, this\ngeneral behavior leaves the open question of the energy source and the\nmechanism of angular momentum transfer that ensures the neutron star's spin\nacceleration.

In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using\nfour-wave mixing in a double-{\\Lambda} configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and\ngenerated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness\noriginates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the\ntwin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the\nintensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis\nfrequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random\nintensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of\nentropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to\nextract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data\nand hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers\nat a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and\nTestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the\npotential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.",

This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many\nnature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing\nneeds. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based\nLLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture\nnuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints,\nand rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose\nLearning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel\nframework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine\nfeedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval\noptimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn\ndirectly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over\nsearch results and produce high quality query expansions that align with\nplatform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale,\nreal-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both\noffline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances\nsemantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in\nuser engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search\nsystems.",

By comparing the rate with the optimal\nlength of a confidence interval that is allowed to use the knowledge of\ncontamination proportion, we characterize the exact adaptation cost due to the\nignorance of data quality. Our construction of the confidence interval to\nachieve local length optimality builds on robust hypothesis testing with a new\nmonotonization step, which guarantees valid coverage, boundary-respecting\nintervals, and an efficient algorithm for computing the endpoints. The general\nstrategy of interval construction can be applied beyond the binomial setting,\nand leads to optimal interval estimation for Poisson data with contamination as\nwell. We also investigate a closely related Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'{e}nyi model with\nnode contamination.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to achieve physical layer security for integrated\nsensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in the presence of targets\nthat may be eavesdroppers. The system is aided by a time-modulated intelligent\nreflecting surface (TM-IRS), which is configured to preserve the integrity of\nthe transmitted data at one or more legitimate communication users (CUs) while\nmaking them appear scrambled in all other directions. The TM-IRS design\nleverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) framework to learn a stochastic\npolicy that samples high-performing TM-IRS configurations from a vast discrete\nparameter space. Specifically, we begin by formulating the achievable sum rate\nfor the legitimate CUs and the beampattern gain toward the target direction,\nbased on which we construct reward functions for GFlowNets that jointly capture\nboth communication and sensing performance. The TM-IRS design is modeled as a\ndeterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state\ncorresponds to a complete configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets,\nparametrized by deep neural networks are employed to learn a stochastic policy\nthat samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their\nassociated reward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed GFlowNet-based method in integrating sensing, communication and\nsecurity simultaneously, and also exhibit significant sampling efficiency as\ncompared to the exhaustive combinatorial search and enhanced robustness against\nthe rule-based TM-IRS design method.",

    "abstract": "Complementary recommendations play a crucial role in e-commerce by enhancing\nuser experience through suggestions of compatible items. Accurate\nclassification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels,\nbut their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used\nbecause they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often\ncontain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels\n(FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by\ncarefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly\nmanual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse\nitems. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation\nLearning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with\nlarge language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL\ndataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier\nfinds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our\nexperiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored\nitem feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In\ncontrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the\nimprovement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy.\nThese contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's\nknowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that\nadjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD).",

The upper-level problem determines the optimal sensor locations by\nminimizing the Integrated Mean Squared Error (IMSE) of the estimated emission\nrates over uncertain wind conditions, while the lower-level problem solves an\ninverse problem that estimates the emission rates. Two algorithms, including\nthe repeated Sample Average Approximation (rSAA) and the Stochastic Gradient\nDescent based bilevel approximation (SBA), are thoroughly investigated. It is\nshown that the proposed approach can further reduce the IMSE of the estimated\nemission rates starting from various initial sensor deployment generated by\nexisting approaches. Convergence analysis is performed to obtain the\nperformance guarantee, and numerical investigations show that the proposed\napproach can allocate sensors according to the parameters and output of the\nforward model.

Employing a\nmomentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on\nequal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the\nhierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by\ntracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The\ninteraction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale,\nsignaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a\ncertain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural\nparameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally\nsymmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the\nrotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed\nFP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and\nestablished by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter\nspace. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby\nthese FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing\ntheir susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and\nsuperconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while\nthe $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In\naddition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities\nare presented as well.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address\nthis limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document\ncomprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate\nthis by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,\nignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential\nfor reasoning.\n  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for\nmulti-modal, multi-page document understanding.

They argue that true comprehension should naturally\nallow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like\nuserIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index\nwithout reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and\ndiscovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned\non forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability\nto reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,\nthey developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three\ntypes of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative\nexamples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.\nThis approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level\npattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally\nwithout explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT\nsuccessfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse\nperformance while maintaining forward task capabilities.

Recent numerical studies of Goto et al. (2017) and Yoneda et al.\n(2022) revealed scale-local energy transfer via vortex stretching but remained\nwithin spatial statistics. This study aims to uncover the time-dependent\nelementary process behind the energy cascade by constructing a tornado-type\nflow in a non-axisymmetric curved cylindrical domain. Our approach reveals\nspecific vortex dynamics responsible for energy transfer, offering new insight\ninto the physical mechanisms of turbulence.",

    "abstract": "Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge\nin reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)\naddresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the\nautomatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level\npolicies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In\nthis paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a\nprincipled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these\nlimitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,\ngoal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a\nhigh-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing\nintermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of\nRLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle\nof value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We\npresent proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various\nconditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical\nplanning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.",
