    "abstract": "Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about\nfuture events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative\nforecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around\nforecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an\nargumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a\nproperty of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a\nforecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three\nevaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of\nenforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive\nwith human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent\npredictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the\npractical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via\ncrowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent\nintuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence\nproperty. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based\njudgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before\nobtaining group forecasting predictions.",

Unlike prior\nmulti-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or\nintermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes\nall scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both\ngeometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware\nvolume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a\nreflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then\nestimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly\nencoded surface normal, view, and light directions.

    "abstract": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\noften exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain,\nespecially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general\ndynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and\nexpanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH\ngravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing\nequations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling\nemerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to\nthermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the\nclassical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell\nexpansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell.\nThis approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass\nestimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and\nprobing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz\nmonitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within\nmonths of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation\nmapping.",

We focus on the general setting in which both the\nupper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to\nthe absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level\nobjective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL)\ncondition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we\nintroduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim\nto design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in\npolynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the\nupper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing\na larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that\na simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent\n(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel\nproblems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\\epsilon_f,\n\\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\\epsilon_f$ and $\\epsilon_g$ denote the\ntarget stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,\nrespectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\max\\left(\\epsilon_f^{-\\frac{3+p}{1+p}},\n\\epsilon_g^{-\\frac{3+p}{2}}\\right)\\right)$, where $p \\geq 0$ is an arbitrary\nconstant balancing the terms.

In general finite normal-form games, we show\nthat the learning process converges to a set of approximate Nash equilibria\nand, more importantly, to a refinement that selects equilibria maximizing the\nminimum (transformed) utility across all players. Our result establishes\nconvergence to equilibrium in general finite games and reveals a novel\nmechanism for equilibrium selection induced by the structure of the learning\ndynamics.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the adverse effects of low-quality or false information, studies\nhave shown the effectiveness of various intervention techniques through\ndebunking or so-called pre-bunking. However, the effectiveness of such\ninterventions can decay. Here, we investigate the role of the detailed social\nstructure of the local villages within which the intervened individuals live,\nwhich provides opportunities for the targeted individuals to discuss and\ninternalize new knowledge. We evaluated this with respect to a critically\nimportant topic, information about maternal and child health care, delivered\nvia a 22-month in-home intervention. Specifically, we examined the effect of\nhaving friendship ties on the retention of knowledge interventions among\ntargeted individuals in 110 isolated Honduran villages. We hypothesize that\nindividuals who receive specific knowledge can internalize and consolidate this\ninformation by engaging in social interactions where, for instance, they have\nan opportunity to discuss it with others in the process. The opportunity to\nexplain information to others (knowledge sharing) promotes deeper cognitive\nprocessing and elaborative encoding, which ultimately enhances memory\nretention. We found that well-connected individuals within a social network\nexperience an enhanced effectiveness of knowledge interventions. These\nindividuals may be more likely to internalize and retain the information and\nreinforce it in others, due to increased opportunities for social interaction\nwhere they teach others or learn from them, a mechanism we refer to as \"social\nboosting\". These findings underscore the role of social interactions in\nreinforcing health knowledge interventions over the long term. We believe these\nfindings would be of interest to the health policy, the global health\nworkforce, and healthcare professionals focusing on disadvantaged populations\nand UN missions on infodemics.",

We previously assessed the\nability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable\nphenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed\nconcept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but\nunderperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these\ncomplex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of\nLLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning.\nMaterials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs\n(DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both\nwith and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and\nunfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt\nmodifications, both errors were present across all models although more\nresponses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For\nexperiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a\nreasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to\nMistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across\nmodels, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty\nreasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for\nreasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can\nhelp prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors\noccur will likely require further development and refinement of\ninterpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across\nLLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task",

    "abstract": "A recent line of research has argued that causal factor models are necessary\nfor portfolio optimization, claiming that structurally misspecified models\ninevitably produce inverted signals and nonviable frontiers. This paper\nchallenges that view. We show, through theoretical analysis, simulation\ncounterexamples, and empirical validation, that predictive models can remain\noperationally valid even when structurally incorrect. Our contributions are\nfourfold. First, we distinguish between directional agreement, ranking, and\ncalibration, proving that sign alignment alone does not ensure efficiency when\nsignals are mis-scaled. Second, we establish that structurally misspecified\nsignals can still yield convex and viable efficient frontiers provided they\nmaintain directional alignment with true returns. Third, we derive and\nempirically confirm a quantitative scaling law that shows how Sharpe ratios\ncontract smoothly with declining alignment, thereby clarifying the role of\ncalibration within the efficient set. Fourth, we validate these results on real\nfinancial data, demonstrating that predictive signals, despite structural\nimperfections, can support coherent frontiers. These findings refine the debate\non causality in portfolio modeling. While causal inference remains valuable for\ninterpretability and risk attribution, it is not a prerequisite for\noptimization efficiency. Ultimately, what matters is the directional fidelity\nand calibration of predictive signals in relation to their intended use in\nrobust portfolio construction.",

For the\nclassification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which\nincorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and\nobtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the\nstandardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal\nsimilarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.\nOur framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS\nacross all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary\nmethod.",

However, establishing a clear causal link between\nvortex structures and force transients remains challenging, especially in\nhigh-Reynolds number nominally three-dimensional flows.

To quantify the influence of these\nvortical structures on the lift transients, we apply the force partitioning\nmethod (FPM) that quantifies the surface pressure forces induced by\nvortex-associated effects. Two metrics - $Q$-strength and vortex proximity -\nare derived from FPM to provide a quantitative assessment of the influence of\nvortices on the lift force.

In many cases,\nthe integration of real-time feedback control and adaptive choice of\nmeasurement settings places strict demands on the speed of this task. Here we\npresent a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast\nand operable on a large number of model parameters. The algorithm is based on\nvariational Bayesian inference (VBI), which approximates the target posterior\ndistribution by optimizing a tractable family of distributions, making it more\nscalable than exact inference methods relying on sampling and that generally\nsuffer from high variance and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. We\nshow how a regularizing prior can be used to select between competing models,\neach comprising a different number of parameters, identifying the simplest\nmodel that explains the experimental data. The regularization can further\nseparate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or\nprocesses, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with\nrespect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a\nbackground. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the\nproblem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a\nsingle electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic\nresonance.

Numerical calculations on transition metal aquo\ncomplexes show improved convergence over existing methodology, while the\npossibility of local CSF energy minima is demonstrated for iron-sulfur\ncomplexes.

Limits to where this feedback might operate on\nterrestrial exoplanets with N2-O2-CO2-H2O atmospheres are used to define the\n'habitable zone'-the range of orbits around a star where liquid water can be\nstable on a planet's surface. However, the impacts on long-term habitability of\nrandomly varying volcanic outgassing, tectonic collisions, and tectonic\nparameters (e.g., number of continental plates, size of plates, plate velocity)\nremain poorly understood. In this work, we present an idealized and\nbroadly-applicable quasi-2D model of the long-term climate stability of abiotic\nEarth-twins. The model tracks atmospheric CO2 as 'disks' collide, promoting\nuplift and supplying new weatherable minerals through erosion. Without\nresupply, soils become less weatherable and the feedback's strength wanes,\nmaking a planet susceptible to catastrophic warming events or hard snowballs\nwhere the surface becomes frozen over.

These annotated examples are\nsystematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through\nexperiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling\nambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.\nSpecifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous\ntext, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single\nmeaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting\nto understand the various possible meanings.

Recent developments have\nintroduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance\nis highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and\ntask condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\ndivergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence,\nwhich provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison.\nUnlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning\nand maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions\nand spatial resolutions.

    "abstract": "The extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in viscoelastic or\npolymeric liquids is studied computationally. At low polymer concentration (c)\nand Deborah number (De), a wake of highly stretched polymers forms downstream\nof the particles due to larger local velocity gradients than the imposed flow,\nindicated by a positive deviation in local De. This increases the suspension's\nextensional viscosity with time and De for De less than 0.5. When De exceeds\n0.5 (the coil-stretch transition), the fully stretched polymers from the far\nfield collapse in regions with lower local velocity gradients around the\nparticle's stagnation points, reducing suspension viscosity relative to the\npolymer-only liquid. The interaction between local flow and polymers\nintensifies with increasing c. Highly stretched polymers impede local flow,\nreducing local De, while it increases in regions with collapsed polymers.\nInitially, increasing c aligns local De and polymer stretch with far-field\nvalues, diminishing particle-polymer interaction effects. However, beyond a\ncertain c, a new mechanism emerges. At low c, fluid three particle radii\nupstream exhibits increased local De, stretching polymers beyond their\nundisturbed state. As c increases, this deviation becomes negative, collapsing\npolymers and resulting in increasingly negative stress from particle-polymer\ninteractions at large De and time. At high c, this negative interaction stress\nscales as c squared, surpassing the linear increase in polymer stress, making\ndilute sphere suspensions more effective at reducing the viscosity of\nviscoelastic liquids at larger De and c.",

We then derive\na lower bound on the energy cost of distributing a maximally entangled state\nvia a quantum channel, which yields a quantitative estimate of energy\ninvestment per entangled bit for future quantum networks. We thereby show that\nirreversibility in entanglement theory implies a non-zero energy cost in\nstandard entanglement distribution protocols.

Although the topology of the graph is fixed,\nwe have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$,\nand hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\\pm\no(1))\\|u-v\\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each\nattractive in its own way.\n  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive,\nnon-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid.\nDistances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove\nthat the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is\n$(1+1/\\Theta(\\log^\\xi \\log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and\n$\\xi=\\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can\nbe improved quantitatively.\n  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of\n\"highways.\" It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which\nconverges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.\n  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to\nsample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\\mathscr{D}$.\nWhether there exists a distribution $\\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances\nEuclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the\ntheory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when\n$\\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\\% of\nEuclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be\nachieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75\nwith probability 44\\% and 56\\%, respectively.",

The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source\ncould be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a\nnon-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\\sim 60$ kpc radius) and\nplace an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $<3\\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nconsistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\\rm kT < 0.5$\nkeV) galaxy group.

Our high angular resolution\nX-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with\nand extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to\nthe radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and\nthe location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that\nthe interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation\nwhich excites CO.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-order hybrid shifted Gegenbauer\nintegral-pseudospectral (HSG-IPS) method for solving the time-fractional\nBenjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers (FBBMB) equation. A key innovation of our approach\nis the transformation of the original equation into a fractional\npartial-integro differential form that contains only a first-order derivative,\nwhich can be accurately approximated using a first-order shifted Gegenbauer\ndifferentiation matrix (SGDM), while all other terms in the transformed\nequation are resolved using highly accurate quadrature rules. The method\ncombines several advanced numerical techniques including the shifted Gegenbauer\npseudospectral (SGPS) method, Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA),\nshifted Gegenbauer integration matrix (SGIM), shifted Gegenbauer integration\nrow vector (SGIRV), and SGDM to achieve spectral accuracy. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the HSG-IPS method outperforms existing numerical\napproaches, achieving significantly lower average absolute errors (AAEs) with\ncomputational times as low as 0.04-0.05 seconds. The method's robustness is\nvalidated across various fractional orders, showing excellent agreement with\nanalytical solutions. The transformation strategy effectively circumvents the\nnumerical instability associated with direct approximation of high-order\nderivatives in the original equation, while the use of shifted Gegenbauer (SG)\npolynomials and barycentric representations ensures numerical stability and\nefficiency.

However,\nconventional ACOPF formulations rely on steady-state models and neglect the\ndynamic behavior of generators, which can lead to operating points that are\neconomically optimal but dynamically unstable. This paper proposes a novel,\ndata-driven approach to incorporate generator dynamics into the ACOPF using\nGaussian Process (GP) models. Specifically, it introduces an exponential\nsurrogate function to characterize the stability of solutions to the\ndifferential equations governing synchronous generator dynamics. The exponent,\nwhich indicates whether system trajectories decay (stable) or grow (unstable),\nis learned as a function of the bus voltage using GP regression. Crucially, the\nframework enables probabilistic stability assessment to be integrated directly\ninto the optimization process.

Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including\nGPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate\nexceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy\non tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results\nexpose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,\nparticularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual\nadaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap\nbut also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that\ncurrent architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene\nanalysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters\nthat humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.\nThis work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward\nhuman-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches\nintegrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and\ncontext-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.",

Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across\nthe diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world\napplications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are\ntrained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.\nMeanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are\nfragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance\ncomputing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,\nwe present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a\ntransformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of\nmaterials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and\ntungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured\nand unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of\ntextual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and\nsolver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation\nacross simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for\npredefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in\nharnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily\non the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and\nrefinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,\nEnriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art\nresults in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater\ninterpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and\nnew domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot\nclassification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA\nwhile being training-free and not requiring human interventions.

A common workaround is to partition measurements and\nestimate local statistics-such as the covariance matrix-using only partial\nobservations. However, this strategy introduces noise in the optimization\ngradients, especially when each partition contains few samples. In this work,\nwe reinterpret this accumulation of gradient noise as a diffusion process,\nwhere successive partitions inject increasing uncertainty into the learning\nsignal. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that leverages\ndenoising diffusion models to learn a reverse process in gradient space. The\nmodel is trained to map noisy gradient estimates toward clean, well-conditioned\nupdates, effectively preconditioning the optimization.

Among our positive findings: in\nsome settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to\nusing human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still\nstruggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic\ninferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only \"inference\" in\nour data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,\nwe also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.",

    "abstract": "Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image\nanalysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios.",

In photonics, nonreciprocity allows control\nover the propagation of electromagnetic waves, essential for isolators and\ncirculators. But achieving optical nonreciprocity typically requires complex\nmetamaterials, exotic media, or strong external fields. Because of this,\nresearchers have historically overlooked the possibility that readily available\nmaterials could support nonreciprocal optical behavior, assuming that\nconventional systems lack the ability to produce nonreciprocal behavior. In\nthis work, we challenge that assumption by revisiting the light-matter\ninteractions of chiroptic and linearly anisotropic media. Through\nStokes-Mueller formalism we derive a simple analytical expression that predicts\na pathway to nonreciprocal absorption and emission of orthogonal linear\npolarizations. We test this idea experimentally using solution-processed films\nof CdS, CdSe, and CdTe magic-size clusters that possess commensurate circular\ndichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD)values and find that they can support\nthis effect, engineering films that exhibit nonreciprocal absorption and\nemission of linearly polarized light. Based on the derived expressions and\nexperiments, several design rules are presented. Our findings reveal that\nnonreciprocal linear dichroism and emission can be achieved in readily\nprocessable, macroscopically symmetric materials by harnessing chiral-linear\noptical interference.

While imaging and spectroscopy are\nwidely used in the microscopy mode, nonlinear polarimetry, which can shed light\non materials' symmetry and microstructure, is relatively underdeveloped. This\nis partly because quantitative analytical modeling of the optical SHG response\nfor anisotropic crystals and films largely assumes low-numerical aperture (NA)\nfocusing of light, where the plane-wave approximation is sufficient. Tight\nfocusing provides unique benefits in revealing out-of-plane polarization\nresponses, which cannot be detected by near-plane-wave illumination at normal\nincidence. Here, we outline a method for quantitatively analyzing SHG\npolarimetry measurements obtained under high-NA focusing within a microscope\ngeometry. Experiments and simulations of a variety of standard samples, from\nsingle crystals to thin films, are in good agreement, including measured and\nsimulated spatial SHG maps of ferroelectric domains. A solution to the inverse\nproblem is demonstrated, where the spatial distribution of an SHG tensor with\nunknown tensor coefficient magnitudes is determined by experimentally measured\npolarimetry. The ability to extract the out-of-plane component of the nonlinear\npolarization in normal incidence is demonstrated, which can be valuable for\nhigh-resolution polarimetry of 2D materials, thin films, heterostructures, and\nuniaxial crystals with a strong out-of-plane response.\n  Copyright 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

The retailer has\ninventory constraints on the number of goods from each type that she can store,\nand she must decide upon arrival of each supplier/customer which goods to\nbuy/sell in order to maximize profit.\n  We design an algorithm with logarithmic competitive ratio compared to an\noptimal offline solution. We achieve this via an exponential-weight-update\ndynamic pricing scheme, and our analysis dual fits the retailer's profit with\nrespect to a linear programming formulation upper bounding the optimal offline\nprofit. We prove (almost) matching lower bounds, and we also extend our result\nto an incentive compatible mechanism. Prior to our work, algorithms for trading\nbundles were known only for the special case of selling an initial inventory.",

    "abstract": "Given the set of words of a given length for a given alphabet, the Hamming\nmetric between two such words is the number of positions where the two words\ndiffer. A quantum version of the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric\non states was introduced in 2021 by De Palma, Marvian, Trevisan and Lloyd. For\nthe quantum version the alphabet is replaced by a full matrix algebra, and the\nset of words is replaced by the tensor product of a corresponding number of\ncopies of that full matrix algebra. While De Palma et al. work primarily at the\nlevel of states, they do obtain the corresponding seminorm (the quantum Hamming\nmetric) on the algebra of observables that plays the role of assigning\nLipschitz constants to functions. A suitable such seminorm on a unital\nC*-algebra is the current common method for defining a quantum metric on a\nC*-algebra.\n  In this paper we will reverse the process, by first expressing the Hamming\nmetric in terms of the C*-algebra of functions on the set of words, and then\ndropping the requirement that the algebra be commutative so as to obtain the\nquantum Hamming metric. From that we obtain the corresponding\nKantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states. Along the way we show that many of\nthe steps can be put in more general forms of some interest, notably for\ninfinite-dimensional C*-algebras.",

Early prediction of kidney injury in\ncritically ill patients is challenging.

Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria\n(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were\nselected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six\nalgorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation.

    "abstract": "The radar interferometric absolute phase is essential for estimating\ntopography and displacements. However, its conventional definition based on the\nrange difference is idealized in that it cannot be applied to complex, dynamic\ntargets. Here, a universal observational definition is proposed, which is\neasiest to describe for differential interferometry: The absolute phase is\ndetermined by temporally unwrapping the phase while continuously varying the\nintermediate acquisition time between primary and secondary acquisitions. This\nabsolute phase is typically not directly observable because a continuous series\nof observations is required. The absolute phase of a point target is\nproportional to the range difference, matching the conventional definition. For\ngeneral targets undergoing a cyclic change, the absolute phase may be nonzero\nand then cannot be interpreted as a range difference. When a phase singularity\n(vanishing coherence) occurs at an intermediate time, the absolute phase\nbecomes undefined, a situation termed an absolute phase singularity. Absolute\nphase singularities complicate absolute phase reconstruction through\nmultifrequency techniques and through unwrapping multidimensional\ninterferograms. They leave no trace in an interferogram, but unwrapping paths\nneed to avoid those across which the absolute phase jumps by nonzero integer\nmultiples of $2 \\pi$. Mathematical analyses identify conditions for\nunwrapping-based reconstruction up to a constant, accounting for absolute phase\nsingularities, undersampling and noise. The general definition of the absolute\nphase and the mathematical analyses enable a comprehensive appraisal of InSAR\nprocessing chains and support the interpretation of observations whenever low\ncoherence engenders phase and absolute phase singularities.",

For enhanced coverage, the\npayload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to\nmaintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to\nachieve a high spreading gain.

    "abstract": "The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently\nbeen shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of\nmany-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order\nperturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems\nis lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent\nquantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as\ncoordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between\nthe initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities\nthrough a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent\ngeneralization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear\nresponse functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various\nlimits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next\norder in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection\nfor general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one\ncontribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and\na second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of\nfirst-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic,\nzero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection\nreduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our\nwork provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry\nbeyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions\ncan probe this geometry.",

Analyses of such networks attract significant attention from both\nthe academics and industries. However, analyses of large directed networks are\noften time-consuming and expensive because the complexities of a lot of graph\nalgorithms are often polynomial with the size of the graph. Hence, sampling\nalgorithms that can generate graphs preserving properties of original graph are\nof great importance because they can speed up the analysis process. We propose\na promising framework to sample directed graphs: Construct a sample graph with\nlinearly rescaled Joint Degree Matrix (JDM) and Degree Correlation Matrix\n(DCM). Previous work shows that graphs with the same JDM and DCM will have a\nrange of very similar graph properties. We also conduct experiments on\nreal-world datasets to show that the numbers of non-zero entries in JDM and DCM\nare quite small compared to the number of edges and nodes. Adopting this\nframework, we propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that can provably\npreserves in-degree and out-degree distributions, which are two most\nfundamental properties of a graph. We also prove the upper bound for deviations\nin the joint degree distribution and degree correlation distribution, which\ncorrespond to JDM and DCM. Besides, we prove that the deviations in these\ndistributions are negatively correlated with the sparsity of the JDM and DCM.\nConsidering that these two matrices are always quite sparse, we believe that\nproposed algorithm will have a better-than-theory performance on real-world\nlarge directed networks.",

In this study, we investigate\nthis transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing\nelectrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified\nelectronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier\ntypes, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of\nthe longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film\nthickness.

Analysis of the WAL\ncharacteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a\nthickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary\nARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the\nconduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap.\nThese findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band\nstructure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a\nfoundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as\nwell as Bi1-xSbx.

While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,\ntext-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for\ninverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based\nframework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it\nbidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio\n(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.\n  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models\ntowards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently\nsupport semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.\nExperimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that\nwhile optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually\nwith targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image\ncaptioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized\naudio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and\nincoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input\nfrom generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently\nlack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.\n  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,\nprimarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the\nstructure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings.

Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this\nrace, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real\nones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this\nwatermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit\nonly by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that\nour technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to\nsolving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content\ncreation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for\nprotecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the\ncontent on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the\nillumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.",

In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a\nclinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis.

While\ntraditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed\nassessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit\nscalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a\nmultimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average\nUniversal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The\nmodel fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and\nhourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)\narchitecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric\ncontext. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical\naccuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\\deg}C,\nwhile reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire\ncity. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate\nsystematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare\nearth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially\nheterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree\nconversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\\deg}C average\nchange in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further\nreveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover\nproportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,\nfine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling\nscenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban\nenvironments.",

Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e.,\nin the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated\nby subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at\nfinite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of\na Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By\nemploying the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are\nregular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme.\nFurthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the\nperturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our\nanalysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order\nand the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale\ndependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing\nconservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly\ndemonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We\nthen assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the\ngravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express\nthe correction in terms of generic $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to\nbe matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we\nargue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with\nfuture-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding\nphase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering\nat the same post-Newtonian order.",

    "abstract": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for\nsimulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods\ncannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into\ncombined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given\nby the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an\neffective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously\nconverged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can\nsubsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method,\nwe combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic\nshear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey\nlike Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$\nequation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 +\nPlanck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone\ncould detect evolving dark energy at $5\\sigma$, while its combination with\ncurrent CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost\n$7\\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that\nour joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero\nBoltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing\nmassive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly\nefficient way.",

These\ncorrespond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed\ntotal momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that\nare entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern\ntheory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose\neigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated\nBerry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the\nphysical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson\nloop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth\ngauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton\npolarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the\nelectron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of\ncrystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are\nquantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in\nterms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider\ncrystalline $C_2 \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are\navailable as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase\nremains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands. Our\ntheory thereby generalizes the notion of shift excitons, whose exciton Wannier\nstates are displaced from those of the non-interacting bands by a quantized\namount, beyond symmetry indicators.",

However, in the\ncontext of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$\ndiscrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is\ncurrently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter\n$N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example,\nwe investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field\ntheory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the\nFD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different\n$N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\\textit{field digitization\nscaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond\ndimension $\\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover\naround a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating\nthat FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\\chi$ and $N$. Finally,\nwe analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the\nground state of a (2+1)D $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a\nFD of compact quantum electrodynamics.

However, most known architectures -\nsuch as MZI and beamsplitter meshes, as well as more general interferometers -\nsuffer from complicated procedures for mapping the matrix elements of the\ndesired transformation to specific phaseshifts in the device.

Using red\ngiant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar\nkinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc\nparameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a\ntransition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older\nthan this have short scale lengths ($\\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc,\nwhile younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age,\nconsistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition\ncoincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length,\neven shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation\nsuggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the\ntransition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc\nformation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2)\nthe GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the\nGalaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption\nled to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc\ngrows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows\nvia hot-mode smooth gas accretion.",

Here we present new, deep ALMA\nobservations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z > 11$ galaxy that\nbridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data\nconfirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\\mu$m line at $4.5\\sigma$ significance,\nprecisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with\nJWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\\nu <\n9.0 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of\n$\\text{SFR}_\\text{IR} \\lesssim 6 \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass\nof $M_\\text{dust} \\lesssim 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ (all\n$3\\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \\pm\n0.0006$ ($\\gtrsim \\! 5\\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that\nredshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\\alpha$ break, even\nspectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential\ndamped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic\noverestimates of up to $\\Delta z \\approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\\mu$m luminosity\nof $L_\\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{L_\\odot}$,\nmeanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs\ngiven the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved\nMIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to\nconsist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star\nformation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~30% solar), only 400 Myr\nafter the Big Bang.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language\nmodels (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few\ndemonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's\nperformance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This\npaper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:\nwe observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the\npositions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are\nvaried. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We\ndesign a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias\nacross classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.\nWe introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify\nnet gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.\nExtensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,\nLLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their\naccuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the\nmost stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,\nplacing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\\% of predictions\nwithout improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by\nthis sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on\ncomplex tasks.",

Central to this progress\nis the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible\nmagic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational\ninterpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this\nwork, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property\ntesting. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable\nmagic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state\nbecomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate\ngoverned by the stabilizer entropy $M(\\psi)$ and the number of available\ncopies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state\n$k$-design, with an approximation error $\\Theta(\\exp(-M(\\psi))$. Conversely, we\nestablish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state\nfrom the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.\nThese results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes\nthe transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby\noffering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a\nquantum resource.",

    "abstract": "Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention\nfor their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken\nqueries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research\nfocused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in\ncomprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true\ncompared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from\nextensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex\nthan text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one\nchallenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as\nphonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.\nAdditionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn\ninteraction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To\nilluminate the current state of SDM development and to address these\nchallenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079\ninstances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method\nthat closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a\ncomprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these\npractical challenges.",

    "abstract": "Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs)\nvia scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter\nannihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS\ncore, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar\nlimit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually\nconsuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old\nneutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit\nprevious constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of\nfermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common\nsimplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our\nanalysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization,\nBH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be\nrelaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted\nfor.",

However, their robustness against\nadversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to\nsystem reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable\nlimitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only\nperturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework\nthat adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary\ngeneration. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop\nuser-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned\nperturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a\npre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating\ngenuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion\neliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates\nthe challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in\ntraditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS\narchitectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly\nenhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional\nbaseline methods.

However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant\non historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,\noptimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.\nThis log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical\npreferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests.

This\nwork introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT\nsolvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is\ndeveloped. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve\nsuperior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are\nproposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,\nemphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)\nAutomatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization\nmethod is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient\nsearch strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary\nalgorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.\nExtensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that\nAutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and\nachieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,\nAutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned\nalternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in\nhandling complex problem instances.

In\nthis work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the\nemission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I\nprotostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and\nL1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly\nface-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the\ncentrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto\nthe plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the\ninclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common,\nwith warm ($T_{\\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\\rm ex} \\gtrsim 100$ K) spots\nor segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these\nfindings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock\ntraced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1)\nthe centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope\noutside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum\nthrough outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the\ncentrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is\npressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling\nmotion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and\nthose off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in\ndifferent ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest\nthat the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like\ninner envelope warrants further special attention.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested\nthe existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In\nthis paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the\naccretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the\nconditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo\nmass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z =\n10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $0.02$ can\nform a black hole of $1.4 \\times 10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$ through GC migration and\naccretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black\nhole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach $\\sim 0.1$, corresponding to the fraction\nof GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a\nplausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining\nour model with halo mass functions and the distribution of spin parameters, we\nconstruct black hole mass functions that successfully reproduce the number\ndensities of massive BH candidates at $z \\sim 5$ inferred from JWST\nobservations, and UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \\sim 10$.",

This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds\nfor FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally\nefficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator.

Theoretically, we first prove the approximation\nproperties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the\nproposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.\nNumerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel\nprincipal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to\ntwo real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and\nlow-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.",

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1.

The standard LoRa encoder\ncontrols 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate.\nSF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial\noff-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based\nencoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS\nLoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph\nsymbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF\nconfiguration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse\nSF configurations to maximize the SNR gain.

Current design\nmethods are based on simple analytical models that idealize the soil movement\nas a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting both the system inertia and the\nrelative displacement at the soil-structure interface. However, this assumption\nmay not be valid for buried large diameter pipelines and tunnels requiring\naccurate dynamic analysis. To analyse the dynamic response of a buried straight\nbeam subjected to transverse TGD, this study introduces a new semi-analytical\nmodel based on the Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory. The\nclosed-form analytical solution revealed that the vibration spectrum is divided\nin four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. Across each\ntransition frequency, the oscillatory characteristics of the vibration modes\nchange, significantly affecting the dynamic response of the system. To verify\nthe validity of the proposed model, this work analyses the case study of a\nburied steel water pipeline of varying lengths and operating conditions,\nsubjected to transverse TGD. Comparison of the obtained analytical solutions\nwith the finite element analysis results showed excellent agreement between the\ntwo approaches. The frequency response analysis revealed dynamic amplification\nof the soil-structure interaction for forcing frequencies near the system's\nfundamental frequency. These may fall within the range of dominant frequencies\ncharacterizing seismic waves, requiring accurate dynamic analysis.

Purpose: In this study, we\npresent the refinement of a Mask R-CNN model initially designed for carotid\nlumen detection to automatically generate bounding boxes enclosing\natherosclerotic plaque for segmentation to assist in our ultrasound\nelastography workflow. Methods: We utilize a PyTorch torchvision implementation\nof the Mask R-CNN for carotid plaque detection. Our dataset consists of 118\nsevere stenotic carotid plaques from presenting patients, clinically indicated\nfor a carotid endarterectomy.

The model trained with 5 maximum prediction regions and tested with 2\nmaximum prediction regions produced the highest individual accuracy with a Dice\nscore of 0.74 and intersection over union of 0.61.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across\na wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature\nlearning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and\nmillions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,\nrequiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that\nintegrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our\napproach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance\nsampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We\nfurther develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly\ninto the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This\nintegration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but\nalso enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several\nfine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN\nvariants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive\nperformance and training speed.",

    "abstract": "For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a\nnot necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of\nconstructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The\ncorrelator construction given in this article applies to the open-closed sector\nand generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given\nby Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of\nFuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational\nspecial case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the\nextension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm\nprinciple. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a\nholographic description, with the main difference that the holographic\nprinciple is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description\nis used to prove that the coefficients obtained by the evaluation of the torus\npartition function at projective objects are non-negative integers. Moreover,\nwe show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent\nsystem of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it\nis equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology\nof the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of\npivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations\nformulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal\nfield theories.",

In cardiac\nelectro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide\nvaluable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of\nassistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators. However, the use of\nautomatically generated tetrahedral meshes, commonly applied due to geometric\ncomplexity, often leads to numerical issues including overly stiff responses\nand volume locking, particularly in incompressible materials. Smoothed finite\nelement methods (S-FEMs) offer a promising alternative by softening the\nstiffness matrix through gradient smoothing over defined smoothing domains.\nThis work extends S-FEM formulations to electro-mechanically coupled problems\nand compares their performance against standard linear FEM. We implement and\nevaluate four approaches in the Abaqus environment via custom user elements:\nstandard linear FEM, face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM), node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM), and\nthe hybrid face/node-based S-FEM (FSNS-FEM). Two benchmark problems are\nstudied: the electrically induced contraction of a compressible dielectric\nelastomer and an incompressible, orthotropic myocardial tissue sample.\nReference solutions are obtained using a mesh consisting of higher-order\nelements. Our results demonstrate that FSNS-FEM provides the best balance\nbetween accuracy and computational efficiency, closely matching reference data.\nNS-FEM produces softer results, which leads to an overestimation of the true\ndeformation. FS-FEM and standard FEM consistently exhibit overly stiff\nbehaviour, with pronounced volume locking in the myocardial case.

    "abstract": "Since any ReLU network is piecewise affine, its hidden units can be\ncharacterized by their pullbacks through the active subnetwork, i.e., by their\ngradients (up to bias terms). However, gradients of deeper neurons are\nnotoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations.\nWe posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the\nintrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying\nsoft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly\nexcited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call \"excitation\npullbacks\", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of\nImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient\nascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific\nfeatures. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the \"path stability\"\nhypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize\nduring training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final\nmodel. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a\nkernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a\ntheoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature\nattributions based on these pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic\ninterpretability of deeper models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation\nfor the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a\nnovel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization\nproperties.

    "abstract": "As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN\nconfigurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user\ndevices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing\nprivacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to\nreconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,\nsemantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose\nCapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level\nsemantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate\nfeatures without image reconstruction.\n  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating\nstrong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up\nto 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from\nResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more\nsemantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,\nwe introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to\nintermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.\nExperimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without\nadditional training costs.",

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality.

We also present the first [OIII]88\nmicron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster\nsystem.

A minimum ionised gas mass of\n$\\mathrm M_{\\rm min}(H^+)$$ \\sim$$3.7\\times 10^{10}$\\,\\Msun\\, is deduced from\nthe [OIII] line, amounting to 30\\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area.\nFinally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line\nluminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can\nsurpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard\nstellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources\ncontribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a\nlarger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in\nHigh-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in\nclusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic\nlines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the\nmulti-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of\nspatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and\nhigh resolution interferometric observations.",

For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain\nof interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can\nbecome overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to\nhigh computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have\nimplemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use\nin the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll\nframework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time\nintegrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time\nstep in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure\nconservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme\nto correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian\ndistribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further\ngeneralized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction\nroutine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and\nconservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more\ncomputationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has\nbeen utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables\n2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56\ntimes faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because\nthe BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is\nrequired by the LBD operator.

However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference.

In this paper we show that if we can sample the PHT\nat the module level, where we have information about how homology from each\ndirection interacts, a ready-made interpolation theory due to Bubenik, de\nSilva, and Nanda using Kan extensions can answer both of these questions in the\naffirmative. A close inspection of those techniques shows that we can infer the\nPHT from a finite sample of heights from each direction as well. Our paper\npresents the first known results for approximating the PHT from finite\ndirectional and scalar data.",

Field theory simulations predict the successive\ncollapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave\nobservable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use the\nparameter-free velocity-dependent one-scale model to provide an estimate of the\nfinal decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a\nfunction of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed\nfor density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure\nformation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting\nnon-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that\ndomain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as\npresent-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of\nstandard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast,\nbiased domain walls generally face much less stringent constraints on their\ntension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our\nanalysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks\ncan provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in\nparticular, a mass excess at $z \\gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.",

Among\nthe limited methods available for strain engineering under cryogenic\nconditions, thermal mismatch with polymeric substrates provides a simple and\naffordable strategy to induce biaxial compressive strain upon cooling. In this\nwork, we demonstrate the transfer of unprecedentedly large levels of uniform\nbiaxial compressive strain to single-layer WS$_2$ by employing a pre-straining\napproach prior to cryogenic cooling. Using a hot-dry-transfer method,\nsingle-layer WS$_2$ samples were deposited onto thermally expanded polymeric\nsubstrates at 100 $^\\circ$C. As the substrate cools to room temperature, it\ncontracts, inducing biaxial compressive strain (up to ~0.5%) in the WS$_2$\nlayer. This pre-strain results in a measurable blueshift in excitonic energies\ncompared to samples transferred at room temperature, which serve as control\n(not pre-strained) samples. Subsequent cooling of the pre-strained samples from\nroom temperature down to 5 K leads to a remarkable total blueshift of ~200 meV\nin the exciton energies of single-layer WS$_2$. This energy shift surpasses\npreviously reported values, indicating superior levels of biaxial compressive\nstrain induced by the accumulated substrate contraction of ~1.7%. Moreover, our\nfindings reveal a pronounced temperature dependence in strain transfer\nefficiency, with gauge factors approaching theoretical limits for ideal strain\ntransfer at 5 K. We attribute this enhanced efficiency to the increased Young's\nmodulus of the polymeric substrate at cryogenic temperatures.",

Utilizing CsSnGeI3 as a lead-free perovskite\npresents a promising solution to the toxicity concerns associated with\nconventional lead-based perovskites. To further increase near-infrared\nabsorption and reduce the required thickness of the c-Si layer, an ultra-thin\ngallium antimonide auxiliary absorber is integrated into the SHJ bottom cell.\nOptical and electrical simulations, conducted using finite-difference\ntime-domain and drift-diffusion modelling, demonstrate that the optimized\ntandem structure attains a power conversion efficiency of 34.93%, surpassing\nthe Shockley-Queisser limit established for single-junction Si cells.\nFurthermore, the optimized device showcases an open-circuit voltage of 1.93 V,\na short-circuit current density of 21.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 84.74%.\nPerformance is additionally enhanced by incorporating cylindrical gold nanorods\nwithin a Si3N4 dielectric medium positioned at the rear of the bottom cell,\nthus amplifying light absorption through plasmonic effects.

To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching\n(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges\nexhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.\nFPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first\nlearns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled\npolyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled\nimages, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while\npreserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted\nalignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling\nthe model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.\nValidated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art\nagainst ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in\ndata-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM\npresents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under\nlimited supervision.",

However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses\nsignificant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data\naccess requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose\na profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are\ncollaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that\ndetermines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data\naccess within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local\nAPs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring\nservers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy\nis evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.\nExperimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability\nby approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied\nworkload conditions.",

Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating\nand recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization\nability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are\nbased on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM\nand the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization\nresults. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in\nlarge, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length\nof LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative\nLLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base\nreward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning.

Its\nproximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its\nprogenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at\nthe nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible\nasymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days\n287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and\nspectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las\nCampanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at\n287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time\n$uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular\nemission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I]\nflux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the\nliterature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we\nconstruct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared\ndata to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a\nprogenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\\odot$. The late-time\nbolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of\n$0.05-0.06 M_\\odot$.

Consistent with previous literature,\nwe find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously\npresent in the disc at varying pattern speeds ($\\Omega_p$) that broadly\ndecrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration\n1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal\ninteractions and bar episodes impact the resulting m=2 spiral structure; strong\nsatellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with\nlarger radial extent, and bars can increase $\\Omega_p$.

We highlight\nmodality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors\nfor depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,\nattention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions\nlike the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching.

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop and optimize a federated learning (FL) framework across\nmultiple clients for biparametric MRI prostate segmentation and clinically\nsignificant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection. Materials and Methods: A\nretrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based\narchitecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data\ncollected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training\nand optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for\nFL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294\npatients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440\npatients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice\nscore for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence\n(PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for\nperformance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The\nFL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved\nperformance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and\n5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the\naverage performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly\nimproved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the\nindependent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection\nperformance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference\nwas observed for prostate segmentation. Conclusions: FL enhanced the\nperformance and generalizability of MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa\ndetection compared with local models, and optimizing its configuration further\nimproved lesion detection performance.",

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,\nthey often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows\nand adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may\nencounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,\nand efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in\nscenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this\npaper, we present \\textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF\ntraining framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a\nparallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient\norchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single\ncentralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that\nadaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing\nhardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable\ntraining conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat\nproduct features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that\nG-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid\nfoundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned\nmodels.",

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we\nintroduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an\niterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence\nlower bound. We show that the \\textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing\nlog-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we\npresent Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\\textbf{QiDBMs}), a\n\\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained\nwith \\textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \\textbf{QiDBM} outperforms\nlarger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a\n40--60\\% reduction in the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance.",

To quantify entanglement, we introduce the\nwrapping number, a pairwise measure of ring interpenetration, while\norientational order is characterized by the alignment of the normal vectors to\nthe rings' osculating planes. Both wrapping number and alignment distinguish\nactive from passive systems, and their combination aptly identifies the\nself-organized states that emerge with the onset of activity.\nMutual-information analysis reveals a significant correlation between alignment\nand wrapping number across all considered active conditions. However,\nself-organization displays a non-monotonic dependence on the activity-induced\nentanglement. Specifically, moderate wrapping stabilizes contacts of\nneighboring aligned rings, while excessive entanglement disrupts alignment. We\nshow that this competition arises because increasing entanglement interferes\nwith the planar conformations required to form aligned stacks. Given the\nsimplicity of this microscopic mechanism, analogous effects may occur more\ngenerally in polymer systems where the degree of entanglement is regulated by\nout-of-equilibrium effects.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe is an important probe for\ndeviations from the canonical cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and cold dark\nmatter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model. A statistically significant detection of any\ndeviations would signify the presence of new physics or the breakdown of any\nnumber of the underlying assumptions of the standard cosmological model or\npossible systematic errors in the data. In this paper, we quantify the ability\nof the LSS data products of the spectroscopic survey of the Euclid mission,\ntogether with other contemporary surveys, to improve the constraints on\ndeviations from $\\Lambda$CDM in the redshift range $0<z<1.75$. We consider both\ncurrently available growth rate data and simulated data with specifications\nfrom Euclid and external surveys, based on $\\Lambda$CDM and a modified gravity\n(MoG) model with an evolving Newton's constant (denoted $\\mu$CDM), and carry\nout a binning method and a machine learning reconstruction, based on genetic\nalgorithms (GAs), of several LSS null tests. Using the forecast Euclid growth\ndata from the spectroscopic survey in the range $0.95<z<1.75$, we find that in\ncombination with external data products (covering the range $0<z<0.95$), Euclid\nwill be able to improve on current constraints of null tests of the LSS on\naverage by a factor of eight when using a binning method and a factor of six\nwhen using the GAs. Our work highlights the need for synergies between Euclid\nand other surveys, but also the usefulness of statistical analyses, such as\nGAs, in order to disentangle any degeneracies in the cosmological parameters.\nBoth are necessary to provide tight constraints over an extended redshift range\nand to probe for deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM model.",

By analyzing the\ndistribution of the partition function zeros, we gain insights into the\nanalytical properties of indistinguishable particles, particularly regarding\nthe fermion sign problem (FSP). We found that at 0~K, the partition function\nzeros for $N$-particles are located at $\\xi=-1$, $-1/2$, $-1/3$, $\\cdots$,\n$-1/(N-1)$. This distribution disrupts the analytic continuation of\nthermodynamic quantities, expressed as functions of $\\xi$ and typically\nperformed along $\\xi=1\\to-1$, whenever the paths intersect these zeros.\nMoreover, we highlight the zero at $\\xi = -1$, which induces an extra term in\nthe free energy of the fermionic systems compared to ones at other\n$\\xi=e^{i\\theta}$ values. If a path connects this zero to a bosonic system with\nidentical potential energies, it brings a transition resembling a phase\ntransition. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the successes and\nchallenges of emerging FSP studies based on analytic continuation techniques.",

We simulate the pre-SN\nmass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS,\nand follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with\nthe CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock\nunder a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling\nduring free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting\ndust mass ranges from $\\sim10^{-3}\\,M_\\odot$ to $0.1\\,M_\\odot$, depending on\nthe mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR)\nemission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with\nobservations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise\nwithin $\\lesssim10\\,{\\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This\nsuggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also\ndiscovered in KN searches.

Going beyond\nUD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with\nchains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to\nthe original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with\nrealistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study,\nwe evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in\nthe recently introduced Crossing Lattice embedding. We find that one strategy,\nbased on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities,\nalbeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective\nregions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads\nto a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic\nassumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings\nlead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures.

For these systems, safety must be ensured\nthroughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon\nverification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent\napproaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based\nguarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for\nroundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper\nbridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations\nby incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,\nactuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the\nproblem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,\nand a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal\nproofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation.

A notable example refers to locally acting drugs\ndesigned to exert their therapeutic effects at a localized area where they are\nadministered rather than being absorbed into the bloodstream, where complex\nexperimental protocols lead to reduced sample sizes and substantial\nexperimental noise.

This paper explores a novel family of commutative\nhypercomplex algebras, referred to as (alpha,beta)-tessarines, which extend the\nsystem of generalized Segre's quaternions and, consequently, elliptic\nquaternions. The main contribution of this work is the development of\ntheoretical and computational tools for matrices within this algebraic system,\nincluding inversion, square root computation, LU factorization with partial\npivoting, and determinant calculation. Additionally, a spectral theory for\n(alpha,beta)-tessarines is established, covering eigenvalue and eigenvector\nanalysis, the power method, singular value decomposition, rank-k approximation,\nand the pseudoinverse. Solutions to the classical least squares problem are\nalso presented. These results not only enhance the fundamental understanding of\nhypercomplex algebras but also provide researchers with novel matrix operations\nthat have not been extensively explored in previous studies. The theoretical\nfindings are supported by real-world examples, including image reconstruction\nand color face recognition, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed\ntechniques.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a\nphysics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation\nof the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters\ngrows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability\nchallenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments\nof the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully\nhandling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation\nproblem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition\nthe RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well\nas the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate\nthe MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with\nan already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between\neach distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the\nsecond and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can\nfurthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate\nour algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a\nrich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter\nmultiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark\nmodels with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB,\nrespectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the\nRIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with\nthe optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC\nawareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we\nobserve that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of\nmodel-based predictions of the expected performance.",

AR models, which\nrely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow\ngeneration speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)\ncaching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel\ntext-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model\nprocesses 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens\nper second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global\ncoherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast\niterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and\nutilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges\ncontinuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR\nflow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This\nefficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model\nhighly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts.\nExperiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently\ngenerate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.",

Band contrast,\nas a proxy for pattern quality, was varied by adjusting the number of frames\naveraged per electron backscatter pattern during data collection. The same\nregion in a deformed sample of the mineral olivine was mapped six times varying\nthe number of frames averaged between 1 and 30 between each map. Each data set\nwas analyzed with HR-EBSD, producing maps of intragranular stress heterogeneity\nand geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density. As the number of frames\naveraged increased, the noise in stress and GND calculations decreased,\nrevealing more substructure in the mapped region. The worst pixels, with low\nband contrast, are the most improved by increased frame averaging, whereas\nthose with high band contrast are largely unaffected. Additionally, the\nprobability distribution of stresses narrows as high-stress noise is reduced\nwith increased pattern quality, which also affects estimates of dislocation\ndensity from statistical analysis of the stress distributions. As regions with\nhigh stress and/or high GND density are typically of interest in HR-EBSD maps\nand are often associated with low band contrast, frame averaging may be used as\na tool to improve the quality of these analyses.

    "abstract": "This work inaugurates a series of complementary studies on Richardson-Gaudin\nintegrable models. We begin by reviewing the foundations of classical and\nquantum integrability, recalling the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the\nRichardson (reduced BCS) and Gaudin (central spin) models, and presenting a\nproof of their integrability based on the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and\ntheir generalizations to perturbed affine conformal blocks. Building on this\nfoundation, we then describe an alternative CFT-based formulation. In this\napproach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are\nembedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate\nconformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class,\nwe develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in\nthe Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix\neigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid\nNewton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical\napplications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and\nhydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and\nreveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex\nrapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to\nfinite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing\nenergies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete\nRichardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe\nequations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of\nVirasoro conformal blocks. We conclude by outlining future directions: direct\nminimization of the Yang-Yang function as an alternative root-finding strategy;\nrevisiting time-dependent extensions; and ... .",

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches.

Prominent examples are exciton states in\nsemiconductors excitable by photons. The high oscillator strength of\nelectric-dipole (ED) allowed exciton states favors their efficient coherent\ngeneration, but limits also their lifetime. ED-forbidden exciton states with\nlong recombination times might maintain long-lived coherence, especially in\nhighly-quality crystals with suppressed exciton scattering. Here, we propose a\nmulti-photon technique combining two-photon excitation with difference\nfrequency generation (2PE-DFG) for time-resolved measurements of exciton\ncoherence. The technique utilizes polarization tomography for state-selective\ncontrol in both the pump and probe processes. Its potential is demonstrated by\nmeasuring the coherent dynamics of the ED-forbidden $S$ and $D$ excitons in\nCu$_2$O crystals. The excited states of the Rydberg excitons with principal\nquantum number $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ have short dephasing times of a few\npicoseconds, limited by their relaxation to lower lying states. The dephasing\ntime reaches 3 ns for the $1S$ state. In an external magnetic field up to 10 T,\nthe $1S$ exciton splits into a triplet so that quantum beats are observed after\ncoherent excitation, for which three distinct regimes are found depending on\nthe chosen polarization tomography scheme.

A single-degree-of-freedom liner with 11 streamwise-aligned\ncavities is studied in a grazing flow impedance tube. The conditions replicate\nreference experiments from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The\ninfluence of grazing flow (with a centerline Mach of 0.32), acoustic wave\namplitude, frequency, and propagation direction relative to the mean flow is\nanalysed. Impedance is computed using both the in-situ and the mode-matching\nmethods. The in-situ method reveals strong spatial variations; however,\naveraged values throughout the sample show minimal differences between upstream\nand downstream propagating waves, in contrast to the mode-matching method. Flow\nanalyses reveal that the orifices displace the flow away from the face sheet,\nwith this effect amplified by acoustic waves and dependent on the wave\npropagation direction. Consequently, the boundary layer displacement thickness\n(${\\delta}$*) increases along the streamwise direction compared to a smooth\nwall and exhibits localised humps downstream of each orifice. The growth of\n${\\delta}$* alters the flow dynamics within the orifices by weakening the shear\nlayer at downstream positions. This influences the acoustic-induced mass flow\nrate through the orifices, suggesting that acoustic energy is dissipated\ndifferently along the liner. The role of near-wall flow features highlights the\nneed to consider a spatially evolving turbulent flow when studying the\nacoustic-flow interaction and measuring impedance. The spatial development of\nthe turbulent flow may also partly explain the upstream-downstream impedance\ndifferences, as current eduction methods do not account for it.",

Furthermore, we determine all non-PNMC biconservative Weingarten\nsurfaces with flat normal bundles that either exhibit a particular form of the\nshape operator in the direction of the mean curvature vector field or have\nconstant Gaussian curvature $K = \\epsilon$. Finally, we prove that such\nsurfaces cannot be biharmonic.",

This is in contrast to\nasymptotic security, where the probability of subversion may be eventually\nsmall, but large enough in practice to be insecure. Fully satisfactory concrete\nsecurity bounds for Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols are difficult to\nattain, as they require reasoning about the running time of cryptographic\nadversaries and reductions. In this paper we close this gap by introducing a\nnew foundational approach that allows us to automatically compute concrete\nsecurity bounds for MPC protocols. We take inspiration from the meta-theory of\nIPDL, a prior approach for formally verified distributed cryptography, to\nsupport reasoning about the runtime of protocols and adversarial advantage. For\npractical proof developments, we implement our approach in Maude, an extensible\nlogic for equational rewriting. We carry out four case studies of concrete\nsecurity for simulation-based proofs. Most notably, we deliver the first formal\nverification of the GMW MPC protocol over N parties. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first time that formally verified concrete security bounds are computed for\na proof of an MPC protocol in the style of Universal Composability. Our tool\nprovides a layer of abstraction that allows the user to write proofs at a high\nlevel, which drastically simplifies the proof size.

    "abstract": "Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in\nsystems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric\nLeave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify\ncooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order\neffects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.\nDifferently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score\nmeasures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by\nthree scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and\nsynergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores\n(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data\nset, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named\n{\\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we\nfocus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and\nAlzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic\nassociation between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,\nespecially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of\nurban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the\nprediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool\nof wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to\nanalyze high-order relationships in complex systems.",

Music activities can be\nparticularly beneficial for BLV people. However, a systematic approach to\norganizing knowledge on designing accessible technology for BLV people has yet\nto be attempted. We categorize the existing studies based on the type of\ntechnology and the extent of BLV people's involvement in the research. We\nidentify six main categories of BLV people-oriented music technology and\nhighlight four key trends in design goals. Based on these categories, we\npropose four general insights focusing on (1) spatial awareness, (2) access to\ninformation, (3) (non-verbal) communication, and (4) memory. The identified\ntrends suggest that more empirical studies involving BLV people in real-world\nscenarios are needed to ensure that technological advancements can enhance\nmusical experiences and social inclusion. This research proposes collaborative\nmusic technology and inclusive real-world testing with the target group as two\nkey areas missing in current research.

Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant\nlimitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and\nremote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB\nimages to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible\nto environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model\nstability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel\npipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,\ncompensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine\nmorphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the\nsubtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an\nadaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale\nAdaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both\npatch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based\nHybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)\nmodule is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our\ndepth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different\nevaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,\nrespectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we\nintegrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.\nThis integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,\nachieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.",

We consider the probability\n$1-p_J$ of finding an impurity at a vertex of the tetrahedron that interacts\nferromagnetically with the remaining elements inside the tetrahedron. An\nintercluster disorder is added as a random Gaussian interaction. The order\nparameters are obtained using the sparse random graph technique, which\nintroduces the connectivity of the network of clusters as a controllable\nparameter in the theory. We examine changes that occur in the Cluster Spin\nGlass phase as a function of $p_J$ and $c$, in addition to the\nantiferromagnetic intracluster couplings $J_1$. For intermediate values of\n$p_J$, unexpected results appear. Even when some clusters contain a\nferromagnetic impurity, there will still be robust geometric frustration\neffects in the cluster network. However, the $p_J$ threshold for this to occur\ndepends on connectivity. Conversely, below this threshold, reduced GF effects\nfavor the reappearance of the CSG phase.

We propose a new\nmethod that considers controlling for false-positive findings while ensuring\nsufficient statistical power.\n  Methods We proposed a new method for multiple corrections called\n(Beta-exponential Adjustment, BEA) that considered the statistical power to\ncontrol for type I errors while also considering the probability of type II\nerrors. We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the performance\ncharacteristic of multiple testing correction procedures. We calculated\nsensitivity, specificity, and power separately for different sample sizes and\nnumber of biomarkers and compared them with the Bonferroni, Holm, and\nBenjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction methods.\n  Results The results demonstrated that our proposed BEA correction method\nexhibited the highest sensitivity at different sample sizes and biomarkers\n(e.g., sensitivity: BEA 0.8 versus BH 0.62 at sample size at 1000, tested\nbiomarkers at 1000 and positive rate at 30%). With different sample sizes and\nnumber of biomarkers, the BEA correction method demonstrated comparable\nspecificity compared with traditional methods. Moreover, we observed that the\nBEA-corrected had the highest statistical power than other methods, when the\noutcome was relatively rare.\n  Conclusion We proposed the BEA multiple correction method to adjust for\nmultiple comparisons while considering statistical power.

We use the open-source\n\\texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions\nfor the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal\nvariations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical\nsimulations of disks.

    "abstract": "Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the\nunderstanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of\ntopological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order\ntopological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different\nhigher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such\ntopological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is\ndifferent from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states,\nand the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to\nprecisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI\nprotected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and\nthird-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel\nbulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we\nalso observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric\nHyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based\nexperimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we\ndemonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the\nunconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization.\nThis work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states\nin both theory and experiment.",

    "abstract": "The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is\nimpacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a\ndomain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable\nof ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an\nimplementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which\ncan be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation\ncapabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots\nto reach an agreement in more than 73\\% of the scenarios with an acceptable\nnegotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the\nnegotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.",

An important question that arises within this framework is how\nrapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are\nprimarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential,\nit has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often\nwithin the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to\nquantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the\ngeometry near the event horizon.

This study aimed to\nevaluate the feasibility of multifrequency MRE in children with solid tumors\nand to report initial findings on stiffness and fluidity across rare pediatric\ntumor entities. Additionally, the potential of viscoelastic properties as\nbiomarkers of tumor malignancy was explored. Materials and Methods: Ten\npediatric patients (mean age, 5.7 +/- 4.8 years; four female) with extracranial\nsolid tumors underwent multifrequency MRE. Shear waves at 30 - 70 Hz were\nsubsequently generated and measured with a phase-sensitive single-shot\nspin-echo planar imaging sequence. The obtained shear wave fields were\nprocessed by wavenumber (k-)based multi-frequency inversion to reconstruct\ntumor stiffness and fluidity. The viscoelastic properties within the tumors\nwere quantified and correlated with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).\nIn addition, differences in stiffness and fluidity were assessed across the\nhistopathologically confirmed tumor entities, which were stratified into\nmalignancy-based groups. Results: MRE was successfully performed in all\npatients in under five minutes. Differences in viscoelastic properties were\nobserved among tumor entities: Stiffness, fluidity, and their spatial\nvariability increased significantly with tumor malignancy. Furthermore, a\nsignificant inverse correlation was observed between stiffness and tumor ADC\nvalues. Conclusion: Multifrequency MRE was feasible in pediatric MRI and\nprovided insight into tumor biomechanics. Preliminary data revealed differences\nin stiffness and fluidity across pediatric solid tumors correlating with\nmalignancy.

First, we train\nspecialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing\nthe unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill\nthis specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy\ncapable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments\nacross five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach\npreserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer\narchitecture achieving 94.47% of teacher performance on training morphologies\nand 72.64% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that\nTransformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by\nleveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across\ndifferent kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful\ndeployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability\nof our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable\nsolution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain\nnear-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.",

These different implantation\nperiods are imposed by the fact that the gas disk profile entirely governs the\nradial distribution of bodies implanted by aerodynamic drag in the asteroid\nbelt. A preferred location coincides with the inner edge of a gap opened by\nJupiter. Saturn's growth likely drove the migration of CM-like bodies. In\ncontrast, CI and comet-like bodies were transported at a later stage during the\noutward migration of Uranus and Neptune, driven by remaining planetesimals.\nSince CM chondrites are chondrule-rich, it follows that chondrule formation\noccurred mostly inward of the ice giants formation zone (under 10 au).

    "abstract": "Magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for\nthe advancement of spin-orbitronic devices, as they enable efficient\nspin-charge conversion, complex magnetic structures, spin-valley physics,\ntopological phases and other exotic phenomena. 5d transition-metal oxides such\nas SrIrO3 feature large SOC, but usually show paramagnetic behavior due to\nbroad bands and a low density of states at the Fermi level, accompanied by a\nrelatively low Coulomb repulsion. Here, we unveil ferromagnetism in 5d SrIrO3\nthin films grown on SrTiO3 (111). Through substrate-induced structural\nengineering, a zigzag stacking of three-unit-cell thick layers along the [111]\ndirection is achieved, stabilizing a ferromagnetic state at the interfaces.\nMagnetotransport measurements reveal an anomalous Hall effect below ~30 K and\nhysteresis in the Hall conductivity below 7 K, indicating ferromagnetic\nordering. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism further supports these results.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that the structural engineering of the IrO6\noctahedral network enhances the density of states at the Fermi level and thus\nstabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism. This work highlights the potential of\nstructurally engineered 5d oxides for spin-orbitronic devices, where efficient\ncontrol of SOC-induced magnetic phases by electric currents can lead to lower\nenergy consumption and improved performance in next-generation device\ntechnologies.",

    "abstract": "Overlapping community detection (OCD) is a fundamental graph data analysis\ntask for extracting graph patterns. Traditional OCD methods can be broadly\ndivided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely\nsolely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent\nyears, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this\ntask. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in\neffectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with\nchallenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their\nperformance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we\npropose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely\nWOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link\ninformation to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce\npseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the\ngeneralization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize\npseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information,\nleading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer\nGraph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance\nimprovements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world\nattributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of\naccuracy.",

Apparently undergoing Eddington-limited\naccretion from its more massive secondary, it is in a very rare, short-lived\nevolutionary phase towards the double degenerate channel. Its complex and\nhighly variable optical emission features, from Balmer and Heii to\nhigh-ionisation lines, including strong fluorescence features, have been\nchallenging to interpret, especially given the absence of any absorption lines\nassociated with photospheric features from either stellar component. With the\ndetailed properties of V Sge, especially the donor, still controversial, we\nundertook a VLT/X-Shooter campaign over three months in 2023, obtaining high\nS/N, high resolution spectra that revealed multiple components in both high-\nand low-ionisation lines. This allows us to track V Sge's principal emitting\nregions via Doppler tomography, obtaining new insights into high accretion-rate\ndynamics. In particular, we identify a stationary, double-peaked emission core\nwhich we interpret as a circumbinary ring, analogous to SS433. This enables us\nto derive limits on the system masses. Furthermore, we find very broad\nemission-line wings whose mean velocity can vary over hundreds of kilometres\nper second on timescales of decades, yet ``flip'' between states in <1 week.

Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown\nfunction defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an\napproximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator\nand denominator. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the\napproximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial\nin the polynomials to fit the rational function to the data in the sense of a\ntropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into\napproximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides, where\none side corresponds to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the\ndenominator. Each side involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown\nexponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials. We\npropose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by\nalternately fixing one side of the equation to an already found result and\nleaving the other intact. Each equation obtained is approximated with respect\nto the vector of coefficients, which yields a vector of coefficients and\napproximation error both parameterized by the exponents. The exponents are\nfound by minimizing the error with an optimization procedure based on\nagglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate, we present results for\napproximation problems in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with\naddition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which\ncorrespond to ordinary problems of piecewise linear approximation of real\nfunctions.

Most existing\ntheoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target\ndomains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to\nmeasures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not\nfully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a\nshared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain\nalignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature\ntransformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first\nderive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers\nof the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize\nthe sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous\nanalysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both\nMMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound\nthat scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our\nanalysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited\nlabeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally\nto the square root of the number of labeled target samples.

While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable\npolitical biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive\npositions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of\nmodels and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of\npolitical biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.\nMoreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.\n  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political\norientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven\nmodels, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using\nthe Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per\nstatement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models\nconsistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant\nvariations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of\npolitical stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention\ntechnique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative\nideological positions across multiple languages.

In the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase, the\ncharm quark interacts with the off-shell partons whose mass and widths are\ngiven by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which can reproduce the\nlattice QCD thermodynamics. The background electromagnetic fields are computed\ndynamically within the PHSD considering both the spectators and participants\nprotons as well as newly produced charged hadrons, quarks, and antiquarks,\nwhich reflects naturally the electric conductivity $\\sigma_{el}$ of the medium.\nWe study the directed and elliptic flow of the $D$ mesons in the presence of\nthe electromagnetic fields.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the\nmanufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data\nsources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such\ncontext-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of\nthe ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the\nproposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data\nrepositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.",

We introduce\nGenerative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first\nmethod to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory\nprediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and\naugments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In\nour framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve\ntail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware\ngeneration method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate\ntrajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike\nprior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the\nfirst to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in\ntrajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,\nArgoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method\nsignificantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on\nhead samples.",

The consequences of\npsychological IPV can include low self-esteem, depression, and even potential\nsuicide. It is, therefore, crucial to identify the most relevant risk and\nprotective factors of psychological IPV against women in Mexico. To this end,\nwe adopt an ecological approach and analyze the role of a wide range of factors\nacross four interrelated levels: Individual, relationship, community, and\nsocietal. We construct a multidimensional data set with 61,205 observations and\n59 variables by integrating nationally representative data from the 2021\nMexican Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships with nine additional\nsources. For model estimation and factor selection, we combine model-based\nboosting with stability selection. Our findings reveal that women who were\nexposed to violence in childhood and whose partners were exposed to violence in\nchildhood face a heightened risk of psychological IPV. These findings highlight\nthe critical yet often overlooked role of childhood violence exposure for\npsychological IPV risk. Additionally, we confirm the role of three protective\nfactors previously identified by Torres Mungu\\'ia and Mart\\'inez-Zarzoso (2022)\nusing 2016 data, now validated with 2021 data: women who had their first sex\nlater in life and under consent, who have autonomy in decision-making regarding\ntheir professional life and use of economic resources, and who live in a\nhousehold where housework is done only by male members face a lower risk of\nsuffering psychological IPV.",

Within this formulation, we show that\nduality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields\nconstitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the\nassociated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the\ndifference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized\ncomponents of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and\nanti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when\nthe gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We\nthen investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality\nsymmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it\nis anomalously broken in curved backgrounds.

While stripped out of correlations effects,\nthis model reproduces some salient features of the impurity charge distribution\nobtained in previous works on interacting disordered impurity models. Computing\nby numerical sampling the impurity charge distribution in our model, we find a\ncrossover from a Gaussian distribution (centered on half a charge unit) at\nlarge hybridization, to a bimodal distribution (centered both on zero and full\noccupations of the charge) at small hybridization. In the bimodal regime, a\nuniversal $(-3/2)$ power-law is also observed. All these findings are very well\naccounted for by an analytic surmise computed with a single random electron\nlevel in the bath. We also derive an exact functional integral for the general\nprobability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenstates, that formally\ncaptures the statistical behavior of our model for any number $N$ of fermionic\norbitals in the bath. In the Gaussian regime and in the limit $N\\to\\infty$, we\nare able to solve exactly the random matrix theory (RMT) for the charge\ndistribution, obtaining perfect agreement with the numerics.

Cascade-like transitions confirm that these states originate\nfrom a single potential well, further supported by calculations. Remarkably, at\nhigh excitation rates, we observe transient suppression of emission followed by\ngradual recovery, a process we term \"quantum siphoning\". Our results\ndemonstrate that quantum confinement and competing nonlinear dynamics persist\nbeyond the ideal moire paradigm, potentially enabling applications in quantum\nsensing and modifying exciton dynamics via strain engineering.",

    "abstract": "Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental\nresearch to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex\nproblems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited\nin their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention\nstrategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network\ncentrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose\nDiagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory\nsystem dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks, flows or\nauxiliaries, and constants - D2D leverages the structural information already\nencoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate hypothetical\ninterventions and explore potential leverage points under uncertainty. Results\nsuggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and low-ranked leverage\npoints. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed from the same CLD and\nvariable labels. D2D showed greater consistency with the data-driven model than\nnetwork centrality analysis, while providing uncertainty estimates and guidance\nfor future data collection. The method is implemented in an open-source Python\npackage and a web-based application to support further testing and lower the\nbarrier to dynamic modeling for researchers working with CLDs. We expect\nadditional validation will further establish the approach's utility across a\nbroad range of cases and domains.",

In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features.

    "abstract": "Runaway stars are defined as stars that depart from their birth clusters at\nhigh peculiar velocities. There are two main mechanisms for the formation of\nrunaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical\nejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is\nan important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two\nmechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway\nstars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic\nTelescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations\nin the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of\n$5.4\\%\\pm 1.6\\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit\nstatistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger\nthan $\\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for\nobservational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\\%\\pm\n8\\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the\nobservation are $f(P)\\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\\leq P\\leq 1000$ days, and\n$f(q)\\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\\leq q\\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for\nbinaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform\ndistribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous\nstudies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES,\nimplies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic\nB-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.",

Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging\nmodality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and\ndiagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed\nlong-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated\nrecognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify\ndata distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for\nlong-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through\nhigh-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic\nperformance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven\nadaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by\ntraining a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data\nwhile ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our\nclass-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception\nbranch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features\nwhile enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house\nlong-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.\nMore synthetic images can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Stinalalala/Breast-LT-GenAug.",

Differentially private stochastic\ngradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a\npronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,\ndegrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been\nproposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control\nknobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization\nlandscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy\nbudget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay\nwithin privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP\noptimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep\nreinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the\nlearning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter\ngradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian\nnoise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language\nmodel fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget\nwhere it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation\nexperiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers\nperplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream\nutility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of\nthe gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same\n($\\epsilon$, $\\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility\nto membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable resource use in large societies requires social institutions that\nspecify acceptable behavior and punish violators. Because mutual monitoring\nbecomes prohibitively costly as populations grow, we examine whether\nsustainability can be maintained when only anonymized information is available.\nUsing the evolutionary dynamical-systems game framework, we model the\ncommon-pool resource management game. In the model, each player's harvesting\ndecisions shape the resource dynamics and depend on the resource's state, the\nplayer's wealth, and the group average wealth. Strategies are encoded as\ntwo-parameter decision-making functions that mutate across generations.\nEvolutionary simulations reveal that players self-organize into clusters that\nalternate harvesting turns: individuals within a cluster harvest synchronously,\nwhile the clusters themselves take turns. The emergent institutional rule is\nstrikingly simple: \"wait when rich, harvest when below average.\" While the\nmajority cluster tends to exploit the minority, moderate diversity in decision\nparameters of strategies allows \"turn-taking of turns\" between the majority and\nminority roles, improving efficiency, equity, and resistance to selfish\nmutants. We quantify the difficulty of managing institutions as population size\nincreases. When group size is fixed, the minimum number of groups required for\ncooperation grows exponentially with group size. If, however, groups enlarge\ngradually, the scaling transitions to a power law, indicating that institutions\nremain stable when they are first built in small populations and subsequently\nadapted to larger ones. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the\nself-organization of institutions in large societies, illuminating how\nanonymized information can coordinate behavior and how institutional success\ndepends on its developmental trajectory.",

In particular, VdWHs support a variety of polaritons-hybrid\nquasiparticles arising from the coupling between electromagnetic waves and\nmaterial excitations-enabling the confinement of electromagnetic radiation to\natomic scales. The ability to predict and simulate the optical response of 2D\nmaterials heterostructures is thus of high importance, being commonly performed\nuntil now via methods such as the TMM, or Fresnel equations. While straight\nforward, these often yield long and complicated expressions, limiting intuitive\nand simple access to the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the optical\nresponse. In this work, we demonstrate the adaptation of the transmission line\nmodel for VdWHs, based on expressing its constituents by distributed electrical\ncircuit elements described by their admittance. Since the admittance carries\nfundamental physical meaning of the material response to electromagnetic\nfields, the approach results in a system of propagating voltage and current\nwaves, offering a compact and physically intuitive formulation that simplifies\nalgebraic calculations, clarifies the conditions for existence of physical\nsolutions, and provides valuable insight into the fundamental physical\nresponse. To demonstrate this, we derive the transmission line analogs of bulk\nto monolayer 2D materials and show it can be used to compute the\nreflection/transmission coefficients, polaritonic dispersion relations, and\nelectromagnetic field distributions in a variety of VdWHs, and compare them to\nexperimental measurements yielding very good agreement.

Droplets in\nPW state exhibit high contact angle but are connected to the substrate though a\nthin liquid condensate column. Coalescence between CS and PW droplets has been\nrecently identified as a possible mechanism for generating droplets exhibiting\nin-plane roaming motion during dropwise condensation on nanotextured\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces. Here, we systematically investigate this phenomenon\nthrough experiments on coalescence between sessile droplets in CS and PW state\non a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface endowed with a micro-scale\nhydrophilic spot. Here, a sessile droplet carefully placed on the hydrophilic\nspot simulates the PW state. Overall, our investigations demonstrate that when\na CS droplet coalesces with a PW droplet pinned to a hydrophilic defect, the\ninteraction generates substantial in-plane momentum. We find that when the\ncoalescing CS and PW droplets are nearly of the same size and about ~3 to ~3.5\ntimes the size of the hydrophilic spot pinning the PW droplet, the vertical\nmomentum generation is nearly completely suppressed, and the resulting maxima\nin in-plane momentum results in detachment of merged droplet from hydrophilic\nspot and its subsequent in-plane motion.",

The approach is further applied to the quantum\ngroup $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its\ngenerators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix\nsatisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit.

    "abstract": "A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic\nstructures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead\nof learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the\noptimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach\ndevises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the\nmethod predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a\nsurrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation\nmethod. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping\nbetween the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space\ndetermined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the\nparametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional\nrepresentation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an\neducated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the\nintermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing\nequations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential\nerrors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the\ndesign in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.\nDifferent architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation\ncapabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The\nquasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by\nreducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\\%$ while\nachieving discrepancies below $4\\%$ in the optimal value of the objective\nfunctional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to\nextrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.",

This key feature enables the solver to efficiently handle problems of\nmedium to large size in an exact manner instead of necessarily resorting to\nfunction approximations.

Hence, these are potentially weaker\nobjects than quantum-secure one-way functions, which can be used to do quantum\ncryptography.\n  A desirable property of PRS and PRFS constructions is scalability, which\nensures that the security parameter $\\lambda$ (which determines\nindistinguishability from their Haar-random counterparts) can be much larger\nthan $n$ (the number of qubits of the output states). This may be important in\nsome applications where PRS and PRFS primitives are used.\n  We present an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states that can be\narbitrarily random (i.e., the trace distance from the Haar-random state can be\narbitrarily small for the true random case, or the distinguishing advantage can\nbe arbitrarily small for the pseudorandom case).

    "abstract": "Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent\nyears because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge\ndevices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network\nparameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To\naddress this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)\nframework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian\nfunction to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the\ncomputational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we\nintroduce Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the\nfractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each\nkernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional\nGaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured\nPruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various\narchitectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent\nmethods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a\n1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%.

In particular, the common approach of\nplacing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a\nglobal control of the wavefront.

Rock records show that this magnetic\nfield has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y).\nHowever, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the\nthermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core\nof less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a\npuzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth\nand the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core\ndynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the\nmantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little\nattention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO\nabove a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner\ncore days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of\nseveral dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh\nnumber, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient\nratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can\neasily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately\nlinear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square\nvelocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\\Nu_o-1)$,\nwhere $\\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\\Nu_o$ of order 1 to\n10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar\nmagnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we\nspeculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.",

This paper proposes a novel RF map construction method based on a\ncombination of physics-informed neural network (PINN) and graph neural network\n(GNN). The PINN incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic\npropagation laws to guide the learning process, while the GNN models spatial\ncorrelations among receiver locations. By parameterizing multipath signals into\nreceived power, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA), and integrating both\nphysical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate\nprediction of multipath parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nmethod enables high-precision RF map construction under sparse sampling\nconditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor\nenvironments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and\naccuracy.",

We further establish the first connection in\nthe literature between the Hausdorff dimension of a weakly branch action and\nits rigidity.\n  Lastly, we put everything together to show that the zero-dimensional\njust-infinite branch pro-$p$ groups introduced recently by the author admit\nrigid branch actions on a tree obtained by deletion of levels.

A Eulerian microphysical model is used to characterize contrail ice\ncrystal properties and their evolution under varying dilution conditions.

Two microphysical activation scenarios are considered:\none incorporating adsorption-based ice nucleation and the other assuming fully\nactivated soot particles. The latter for two soot number emission indices. The\ndilution process and wake structure exhibit a strong dependence on engine\nplacement, which significantly influences plume saturation. In highly diluted\nconfigurations, enhanced early-stage mixing reduces plume temperature and\nincreases relative humidity, favoring the growth of larger ice crystals.\nDepending on the soot number concentration, vapor depletion effects may\noutweigh dilution-driven changes in water vapor availability. In\nadsorption-limited activation scenarios, increased dilution reduces the\nconcentration of sulfur species, leading to a lower activation fraction and the\nformation of smaller ice crystals.

To fully leverage this mask,\nwe introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather\nremoval and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.\nWe also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel\nattention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise\nrelationships and spatial dependencies.

The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from\nthe input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling\nuncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture\nconsists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder\nimplements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process\n(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating\nbetween a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with\nthe interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function\nlearned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over\nthe solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to\nthe latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible\nfunction-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft\nconstraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE\nstructure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed\nneural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can\nefficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian\nprocess and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and\nrobust uncertainty quantification.

As the plume cools through adiabatic expansion, chemical reactions\nare predicted to quench, leading to a non-equilibrium composition. However, it\nis still unclear how chemical reactions proceed during the cooling impact vapor\nplume and lead to the synthesis of organic molecules. In this study, to\ninvestigate the evolution of chemical composition within impact vapor plumes,\nwe conducted a Monte Carlo chemical reaction simulation for complex organic\nsynthesis, developed in our previous work. Our model does not rely on a\npredefined reaction network; instead, it utilizes imposed conditions for\nchemical changes and an approximate method for calculating reaction rates\nsuited to our objectives. Additionally, we developed a new approach to couple\nthese chemical reaction calculations with the rapid temperature and pressure\ndecay in the vapor plume. Results show diverse organic molecule production\ndepending on the impactor materials assumed in this study. These products\ninclude important precursors to biomolecules such as amino acids, sugars, and\nnucleobases. On the other hand, for all impactor compositions, the abundance of\nbiomolecules themselves remains extremely low throughout the reactions from an\nimpact to quenching. Therefore, our results suggest that biomolecules are not\ndirectly produced in impact vapor plumes but rather synthesized through\nreactions of these precursor molecules in aqueous solutions, following H2O\ncondensation as the vapor plume cools. Many of the detected organic compounds,\nincluding the precursor molecules such as imine compounds and formamide, are\nnot included in the reaction networks of previous kinetic model simulations,\nand their formation has not been predicted.",

A heat transfer model for three-layer heterostructures is\ndeveloped by combining First-principles calculations with the Monte Carlo\nmethod. The temperature distribution, spectral heat conductance, and\ninterfacial thermal conductance are compared for Si/Diamond heterostructures\nwith and without a silicon carbide (SiC) interlayer. The results show that the\nSiC interlayer effectively bridges low-frequency phonons in Si with\nmid-to-high-frequency phonons in Diamond, which forms a specific phonon bridge,\nsignificantly improving interfacial phonon transport. The influence of SiC\ninterlayer thickness is further studied, revealing a size-dependent phonon\nbridge enhancement. For thin interlayers, intensified phonon boundary\nscattering weakens the bridging effect. Conversely, excessively thick\ninterlayers increase the bulk thermal resistance, reducing overall interfacial\nthermal conductance. Thus, an optimal interlayer thickness exists, identified\nas 40 nm for SiC.

    "abstract": "Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface\nmass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding\nfuture sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally\ndemanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel\nphysics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model\n(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor\nof up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM\nis trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and\nconditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard\nconservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of\nSMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust\ngeneralization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,\nour constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE\nfor the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming\ninterpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,\nwe demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial\nscales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System\nModel as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to\ndirectly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution\nclimate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be\nreadily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve\nprojections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and\npotentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.",

This process belongs to a family of population\ngenetics processes in a spatial continuum, and was recently introduced to study\nthe evolution of genetic diversity in spatially expanding populations. Its\nstochastic reproduction dynamics gives rise to a rich growth structure, on\nwhich first theoretical results were obtained. In this paper, we further\nexplore this growth dynamics using two complementary approaches: an analytical\nstudy of a simplified model for growth at the front edge, and a\nsimulation-based study. We show that the observed expansion speed is the result\nof the interplay of stochasticity in shapes, timings and locations of\nreproduction events, each form of stochasticity being necessary but not\nsufficient to explain the expansion dynamics. We also identify distinctive\nscaling regimes for the variance of hitting times by the front and the bulk of\nthe expansion.

The distribution and abundance of different\nmolecules provide information on the chemical composition and physical\nproperties in these cores. We study the chemical segregation of three molecules\n(c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH) in the starless cores B68 and L1521E, and\nthe prestellar core L1544. We applied the density-based clustering algorithms\nDBSCAN and HDBSCAN to identify chemical and physical structures within these\ncores. To enable cross-core comparisons, the input samples were characterised\nbased on their physical environment, discarding the 2D spatial information. The\nclustering analysis showed significant chemical differentiation across the\ncores, successfully reproducing the known molecular segregation of c-C$_3$H$_2$\nand CH$_3$OH in all three cores. Furthermore, it identifies a segregation\nbetween c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$CCH, which is not apparent from the emission\nmaps. Key features driving the clustering are integrated intensity, velocity\noffset, H$_2$ column density, and H$_2$ column density gradient. Different\nenvironmental conditions are reflected in the variations in the feature\nrelevance across the cores. This study shows that density-based clustering\nprovides valuable insights into chemical and physical structures of starless\ncores. It demonstrates that already small datasets of two or three molecules\ncan yield meaningful results. This new approach revealed similarities in the\nclustering patterns of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CCH relative to c-C$_3$H$_2$,\nsuggesting that c-C$_3$H$_2$ traces regions of lower density than to the other\ntwo molecules.

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and\nhigh-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our\nmethod suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge.

    "abstract": "Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum\ncomputing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum\nchemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which\nrequire a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant\nchallenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this\nwork, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE)\nalgorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE.\nAWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m > 1$ control qubits to estimate\nmultiple phase bits simultaneously within a \"window,'' thereby significantly\nreducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision.\nThese independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined\nwith a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB)\nambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while\nmitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate\nAWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource\nefficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited\nfor near-term quantum platforms.",

    "abstract": "Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address\nperformance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.\nPrevious TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images\nare degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for\nrestoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most\npowerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help\ngenerate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details\nremains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address\nthis, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior\nto restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging\nuseful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from\npixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we\nemploy a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant\ndetails that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our\nmethod effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing\ntask performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex\ndegradations.",

Recent LiDAR Diffusion\nModels (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for\nimproved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to\nmodel detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological\nconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel\nframework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models\nunder topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation.

We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology\n(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world\nglobal topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset\ndemonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nimprovements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower\nMinimum Matching Distance (MMD).

Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge\nacquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper\nintroduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia\narticles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online\ninformation, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in\nWikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our\nfine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human\nedits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing\nbehavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following\nbaselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and\nediting efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages\ndemonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.\nThis opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically\nupdating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.",

But, detecting such threats\nremains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and\nJavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure\nstructures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid\ndefense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation\nwith code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated\nprompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM\nprogressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs\nand then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2)\nIn JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while\ndeeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise\nand semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn\nhierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that\nsynergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and\nnode-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level\nsemantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64%\nand 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of\n10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.\nHowever, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,\nwhile overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can\nsubstantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes\nstructural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced\nand process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust\nActive learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles\nboth structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor\nlink annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.\nSpecifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the\nLabel Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,\nrespectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization\nobjective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address\nstructural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion\ndenoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide\nmore accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active\nlearning-based methods in alignment accuracy.

As the foundation vision\nencoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language\nmodels (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:\nCan we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair\ndata, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for\ncontinuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this\nvision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework\nleverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four\ncomplementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative\ndescriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this\npipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset\nenriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further\npropose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by\nincorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised\nsignals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable\nimprovements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data\nscale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot\nclassification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding\ntasks.

    "abstract": "The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe\ndeployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future\nwork involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and\noptimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training\nhyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.",

Existing approaches often struggle to\nbalance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments.\nIn this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced\nspatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and\nobject tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence\nmodeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that\nadaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard\nbenchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds.

A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution\nusing the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of\ngenerative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent\nstochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their\neffectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed\nmethod leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based\ngenerative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate\nsegmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling\nmultiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose\npixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This\nsampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,\noffering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive\nsegmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper\ninsights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

The dynamics along\nhomoclinic/heteroclinic orbits is encoded via scattering maps, which we compute\nnumerically. We provide two arguments for diffusion.

In particular, neutron star equations of state have\nbeen constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories.\nRecently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed Neutron stars via\nground-based laser interferometry have been explored. Dark matter would impact\nthe gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal\nparameters, namely the tidal deformability $\\lambda$, incurring a phase shift\nto the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on\nthe percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g.,\nbosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture\nwithin neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as\nwell as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this\nwork, we introduce Darksuite, a proposed extension of the LALSuite software\nframework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of\ndark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the\ntwo-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman- Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations,\nwherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We\ndemonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the\nstudy of binary systems where at least one component may be a\ndark-matter-admixed neutron star.

Additionally, our communication-efficient\nstrategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.\n  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher\nF1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment.

    "abstract": "Moir\\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive\nstructures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant\nobstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and\nindustrial defect inspection.

Despite these\nefforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts\ndue to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\\'e patterns,\nprimarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures\nlimits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\\'e\npatterns.

    "abstract": "The case of a conventional flexible sheet in a uniform flow has been of\ninterest in understanding the underlying physics of passive coupled dynamics\nbetween a flexible structure and a flow field. Gravity is known to influence\nthe flapping instability and post-critical dynamics. Interestingly, the\nflapping instability and dynamics of a thin flexible structure have been\ninvestigated either by neglecting the effects of gravity or by considering\ngravity along the length/span of the sheet. This study experimentally\ninvestigates the self-induced and sustained flapping dynamics of a thin\nflexible sheet positioned horizontally, with gravity acting along its bending\ndirection. To explore the coupled interplay between gravitational, aerodynamic,\nand structural effects on the onset of instability and post-critical flapping\ndynamics, wind tunnel experiments are conducted across a range of physical\nparameters of the flexible sheet, such as its length (L), and aspect-ratio\n($\\AR$) for different wind speeds. To further understand the effects of\ngravity, the flapping behaviour of a vertically mounted flexible sheet with\ngravity acting along its span has been investigated, and comparisons have been\ndrawn with its horizontal counterpart. It has been observed that gravity along\nthe bending does not influence the onset of flapping instability. The\nhorizontally mounted flexible structures exhibit higher flapping amplitudes and\nfrequencies when compared to their vertical counterparts.

    "abstract": "We investigate $J/\\psi$ photoproduction off the nucleon using a dynamical\nmodel based on a Hamiltonian framework. First, Pomeron exchange is regarded as\na background contribution that accounts for the gradual rise of the total cross\nsection with increasing beam energy. Then, the meson-exchange and direct\n$J/\\psi$-radiation contributions are included as part of the Born term. More\nspecifically, we examine the contributions of the light-meson [$\\pi^0(135)$,\n$\\eta(548)$, $\\eta'(958)$, $f_1(1285)$] and charmonium-meson [$\\eta_c(1S)$,\n$\\chi_{c0}(1P)$, $\\chi_{c1}(1P)$, $\\eta_c(2S)$, $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$] exchanges in\nthe $t$-channel diagram. Most of the coupling constants are determined from the\nradiative decays of the $J/\\psi$ or other relevant charmonium states. Finally,\nwe consider the $J/\\psi N$ final-state interaction (FSI) within the\nleading-order approximation, which includes gluon-exchange and direct $J/\\psi\nN$-coupling terms. The model parameters of the Hamiltonian are fitted to the\ndata from the GlueX and $J/\\psi$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory\n(JLab). The light mesons $\\eta(548)$ and $\\eta'(958)$ are found to make the\nmost significant contributions, whereas the charmonium mesons play only a minor\nrole. The direct $J/\\psi$-radiation term begins to come into play only in the\nbackward scattering regions. The FSI contribution is suppressed by a factor of\n$10^1 - 10^2$ in comparison to the Born-term contribution when a Yukawa-type\npotential is employed for the charmonium-nucleon interaction. Our results agree\nwell with the available JLab data on the total and $t$-dependent differential\ncross sections. High-precision, angle-dependent data in the threshold region\n($E_\\gamma \\leqslant 8.9$ GeV) are crucial for confirming the FSI effect.",

On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is\nmoved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask\nhow to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the\nunitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit\nconstrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for\nsymmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome,\nwhich we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines\nthe symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast,\nfor unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the\nCheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full\ndescription. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator\nrepresentations play an important role in our discussion.",

To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on\nVGAF-GEMS benchmarking.

The situation is\nevolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the\nintelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours.

In our experiments, we utilize\nmeteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United\nStates (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our\nframework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,\nfrost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.\nThe framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a\nrecurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal\nexplanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but\nprecisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive\naccuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's\ncapacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies.

Quantum kinetic\nsimulations corroborate these observations, allowing us to underpin the\nemergence of synchronized Anderson pseudo-spin oscillations -- analogous to\nDicke superradiance -- mediated by persistent order parameter oscillations. In\nthis coherently driven state, the observed sidebands result from\ndifference-frequency mixing between the THz drive and persistent soliton\ndynamics.

However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from\npoor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain\nshifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of\ncomplex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the\ntraining environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by\nobservations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly\nlearn the causal relationship between observation components and expert\nactions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural\nfunction is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.\nDisentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to\nsatisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we\ntheoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal\nrelationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning\nframework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning\narchitectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our\napproach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,\nand show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem\nof existing complex imitation learning algorithms.",

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To\nbe specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease\ndimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for\neffective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve\ngeneralization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to\napply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in\nextracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.\nFurthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features\nfurther improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set\nhave demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,\napproximately a 45\\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE).

    "abstract": "Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore\nplatforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can\ncause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element\n(FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM),\nits high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where\nlow dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or\nstress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum\nclassical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and\nfacilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural\napplications.\n  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD)\nmatrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to\nquantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these\nfeatures, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural\nnetwork for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical\nmodeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving\ncomputational viability.\n  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP\nachieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely\nclassical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential\nof quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward\nmore efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose\nstructural integrity in near real time.",

In this chapter, a a\nsoil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in\norder to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust\nautonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended\nto incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade\nthrough the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately\ntracking undisturbed and disturbed soil.

A simulation of a\ncompact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to\ntrain the PINN model.

However, optimizing VaR metrics in Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) is challenging because VaR is non-additive and the traditional\ndynamic programming is inapplicable. This paper conducts a comprehensive study\non VaR optimization in discrete-time finite MDPs. We consider VaR in two key\nscenarios: the VaR of steady-state rewards over an infinite horizon and the VaR\nof accumulated rewards over a finite horizon. By establishing the equivalence\nbetween the VaR maximization MDP and a series of probabilistic minimization\nMDPs, we transform the VaR maximization MDP into a constrained bilevel\noptimization problem. The inner-level is a policy optimization of minimizing\nthe probability that MDP rewards fall below a target $\\lambda$, while the\nouter-level is a single parameter optimization of $\\lambda$, representing the\ntarget VaR. For the steady-state scenario, the probabilistic minimization MDP\ncan be resolved using the expectation criterion of a standard MDP. In contrast,\nfor the finite-horizon case, it can be addressed via an augmented-state MDP. We\nprove the optimality of deterministic stationary policies for steady-state VaR\nMDPs and deterministic history-dependent policies for finite-horizon VaR MDPs.\nWe derive both a policy improvement rule and a necessary-sufficient condition\nfor optimal policies. Furthermore, we develop policy iteration type algorithms\nto maximize the VaR in MDPs and prove their convergence. Our results are also\nextended to the counterpart of VaR minimization MDPs after appropriate\nmodifications. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the\ncomputational efficiency and practical applicability of our approach. Our study\npaves a novel way to explore the optimization of quantile-related metrics in\nMDPs through the duality between quantiles and probabilities.",

The evolution of magnetism and topology with twist angle remains an\nopen question. Here, we systematically map the magnetic phase diagram of\ntMoTe$_2$ using local optical spectroscopy and scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip (nSOT)\nmagnetometry. We identify spontaneous ferromagnetism at moir\\'e filling factors\n$\\nu = -1$ and $-3$ over a twist angle range from 2.1$^\\circ$ to 3.7$^\\circ$,\nrevealing a universal, twist-angle-insensitive ferromagnetic phase. At\n2.1$^\\circ$, we further observe robust ferromagnetism at $\\nu = -5$, absent in\nthe devices with larger twist angle -- a signature of the flattening of higher\nbands in this twist angle range. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a\ncontrasting twist-angle dependence of the Curie temperatures between $\\nu = -1$\nand $\\nu = -3$, indicating distinct interplay between exchange interaction and\nbandwidth for the two Chern bands. Despite spontaneous time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking, we find no evidence of a topological gap at $\\nu = -3$; however,\nfragile correlated topological phases could be obscured by the device disorder\nevident in our spatially resolved measurements.

    "abstract": "Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a\ncritical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward\nartificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper\nintroduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face\nrecognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized\ncategory discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled\nknown identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen\nIDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high\ncardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD\napproaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method\nthat dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using\nlightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a\nHyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned\non each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle\nidentity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms\nexisting GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face\nrecognition.",

However, since\nacquiring external information often incurs costs, it is desirable to assess\nits utility beforehand using only the internal data. To address this need, we\nintroduce a utility measure based on estimation efficiency, defined as the\nratio of semiparametric efficiency bounds for estimating the target parameters\nwith versus without incorporating the external information.

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the\noptimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

The third parties submit their\nfraud detectors to the data holder, who evaluates these algorithms on a private\ndataset and then publicly communicates the results. We propose a realistic\nprivacy attack on this system that allows an adversary to de-anonymize\nindividuals' data based only on the evaluation results.

Next, we represent the extended\nversion of Riemann zeta function\n$\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{(m+n)^{-s}}$ using the following\ncomplex integral where the real part of $s$ is larger than 2 and $c>1$ is\nchosen to make $\\Re(s)-c$ larger than 1.\n$$\\Gamma(s)\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{(m+n)^{-s}}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{c - i\\infty}^{c + i\\infty} \\zeta(z) \\zeta(s - z) \\Gamma(z) \\Gamma(s - z)\n\\, dz$$ We provide the evaluation of this integral by changing the integration\npath from straight line $\\Re(z)=c$ into a rectangular contour whose left side\nis positioned at negative infinity. We apply the functional equation of Riemann\nzeta function, Euler's reflection formula, and Legendre's duplication formula\nto evaluate the integral segment through $\\Re(z)=-\\infty$. After introducing\nHurwitz zeta function and properly calculating the difference between the sum\nof residues in two analogous rectangular contours, we finalize the evaluation.\nLastly, we demonstrate the connection of this result with other intricate\nintegrals involving special functions, such as the hyperbolic function.\nAdditionally, we discuss its applications in deriving explicit expressions for\nthe Barnes zeta function.",

    "abstract": "An inherent regularization strategy and block Schur complement\npreconditioning are studied for linear poroelasticity problems discretized\nusing the lowest-order weak Galerkin FEM in space and the implicit Euler scheme\nin time. At each time step, the resulting saddle point system becomes nearly\nsingular in the locking regime, where the solid is nearly incompressible. This\nnear-singularity stems from the leading block, which corresponds to a linear\nelasticity system. To enable efficient iterative solution, this nearly singular\nsystem is first reformulated as a saddle point problem and then regularized by\nadding a term to the (2,2) block. This regularization preserves the solution\nwhile ensuring the non-singularity of the new system. As a result, block Schur\ncomplement preconditioning becomes effective. It is shown that the\npreconditioned MINRES and GMRES converge essentially independent of the mesh\nsize and the locking parameter. Both two- and three-field formulations are\nconsidered for the iterative solution of the linear poroelasticity. The\nefficient solution of the two-field formulation builds upon the effective\niterative solution of linear elasticity. For this case, MINRES and GMRES\nachieve parameter-free convergence when used with block Schur complement\npreconditioning, where the inverse of the leading block leverages efficient\nsolvers for linear elasticity. The poroelasticity problem can also be\nreformulated as a three-field system by introducing a numerical pressure\nvariable into the linear elasticity part. The inherent regularization strategy\nextends naturally to this formulation, and preconditioned MINRES and GMRES also\nshow parameter-free convergence for the regularized system.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing\nclient model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require\nexternal data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,\nwhich can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit\nhypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization\ncapabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous\npersonalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which\nleverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding\nvectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's\nheterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we\nintroduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with\nsimilar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose\nMH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve\ngeneralization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not\nrequire disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced\nprivacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model\nsettings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong\ngeneralization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in\nmodel-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.",

However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract\ndiagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling\nremain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist\nfor automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.\nIn this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large\nMultimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our\nfindings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric\nperception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry\nlabeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel\nframework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for\nstructured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning\napproach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:\nperceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,\nand estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage\nframework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint\ndiagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on\nreal-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical\nscenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with\n8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and\n4470 synthetically generated samples.

This paper studies the\nmean-variance optimization in a setting of finite-horizon discrete-time Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), where the objective is to maximize the combined\nmetrics of mean and variance of the accumulated rewards at terminal stage. By\nintroducing the concepts of pseudo mean and pseudo variance, we convert the\noriginal mean-variance MDP to a bilevel MDP, where the outer is a single\nparameter optimization of the pseudo mean and the inner is a standard\nfinite-horizon MDP with an augmented state space by adding an auxiliary state\nof accumulated rewards. We further study the properties of this bilevel MDP,\nincluding the optimality of history-dependent deterministic policies and the\npiecewise quadratic concavity of the inner MDPs' optimal values with respect to\nthe pseudo mean. To efficiently solve this bilevel MDP, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm that alternatingly updates the inner optimal policy and the outer\npseudo mean. We prove that this algorithm converges to a local optimum. We also\nderive a sufficient condition under which our algorithm converges to the global\noptimum. Furthermore, we apply this approach to study the mean-variance\noptimization of multi-period portfolio selection problem, which shows that our\napproach exactly coincides with the classical result by Li and Ng (2000) in\nfinancial engineering.

    "abstract": "The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of\nMLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and\ndifficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these\nissues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient\nmodeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the\nconstraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review\ncategorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct\nperspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and\n(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of\narchitectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and\ncomparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs\nagainst MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,\nand spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex\ndynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies\ncritical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,\nparticularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,\nhyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future\nresearch directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and\nphysical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Climate science needs more efficient ways to study high-impact,\nlow-probability extreme events, which are rare by definition and costly to\nsimulate in large numbers. Rare event sampling (RES) and ensemble boosting\noffer a novel strategy to extract more information from those occasional\nsimulated events: small perturbations in advance can turn a moderate event into\na severe one, which otherwise might not come for many more simulation-years.\nBut how to choose this ``advance split time'' (AST) remains a challenge for\nsudden, transient events like precipitation. In this work, we formulate a\nconcrete optimization problem for the AST and instantiate it on an idealized\nbut physically informative model system: a quasigeostrophic turbulent channel\nflow advecting a passive tracer, which captures key elements of midlatitude\nstorm track dynamics. Three major questions guide our investigation: (1) Can\nRES methods, in particular \\emph{ensemble boosting} and \\emph{trying-early\nadaptive multilevel splitting}, accurately sample extreme events of return\nperiods longer than the simulation time? (2) What is the optimal AST, and how\ndoes it depend on the definition of the extreme event, in particular the target\nlocation? (3) Can the AST be optimized ``online'' while running RES?\n  Our answers are tentatively positive. (1) RES can meaningfully improve tail\nestimation, using (2) an optimal AST of 1-3 eddy turnover timescales, which\nvaries weakly but detectably with target location. (3) A certain functional\nthat we call the \\emph{thresholded entropy} successfully picks out near-optimal\nASTs, eliminating the need for arbitrary thresholds that have thus far hindered\nRES methods. Our work clarifies aspects of the optimization landscape and can,\nin our view, guide future research efforts on optimizing and sampling transient\nextreme events more efficiently in general chaotic systems.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have revolutionized multimodal AI applications\nbut introduce novel security vulnerabilities that remain largely unexplored. We\npresent the first comprehensive study of steganographic prompt injection\nattacks against VLMs, where malicious instructions are invisibly embedded\nwithin images using advanced steganographic techniques. Our approach\ndemonstrates that current VLM architectures can inadvertently extract and\nexecute hidden prompts during normal image processing, leading to covert\nbehavioral manipulation. We develop a multi-domain embedding framework\ncombining spatial, frequency, and neural steganographic methods, achieving an\noverall attack success rate of 24.3% (plus or minus 3.2%, 95% CI) across\nleading VLMs including GPT-4V, Claude, and LLaVA, with neural steganography\nmethods reaching up to 31.8%, while maintaining reasonable visual\nimperceptibility (PSNR greater than 38 dB, SSIM greater than 0.94). Through\nsystematic evaluation on 12 diverse datasets and 8 state-of-the-art models, we\nreveal moderate but meaningful vulnerabilities in current VLM architectures and\npropose effective countermeasures. Our findings have significant implications\nfor VLM deployment in security-critical applications and highlight the need for\nproportionate multimodal AI security frameworks.",

    "abstract": "We present CS-SHRED, a novel deep learning architecture that integrates\nCompressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) to reconstruct\nspatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete, compressed, or corrupted data. Our\napproach introduces two key innovations. First, by incorporating CS techniques\ninto the SHRED architecture, our method leverages a batch-based forward\nframework with $\\ell_1$ regularization to robustly recover signals even in\nscenarios with sparse sensor placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete\nsensor acquisitions. Second, an adaptive loss function dynamically combines\nMean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers\nin low-SNR regions while preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.\n  We validate CS-SHRED on challenging problems including viscoelastic fluid\nflows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface temperature distributions,\nand rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the traditional SHRED approach,\nCS-SHRED achieves significantly higher reconstruction fidelity -- as\ndemonstrated by improved SSIM and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and\nenhanced LPIPS scores-thereby providing superior preservation of small-scale\nstructures and increased robustness against noise and outliers.\n  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED\ndesign architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing\nthe temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the\nhigh-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the\nspatiotemporal data recovery establishes CS-SHRED as a promising tool for a\nwide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and scientific data\nanalyses.",

Historically, observation and\nmanipulation of these processes, for instance through nanostructures, has been\nlimited to optical and lower frequencies. Recently, however, second-order\nnonlinear processes which couple X-ray and optical photons have been observed\nand used to probe the electronic structure and optical response of materials.\nObserving and controlling these processes remains challenging due to their low\nefficiency and the difficulty of fabricating devices with spatial features on\nthe scale of X-ray wavelengths. Here, we show how optical nanostructures can be\nused to manipulate X-ray/optical nonlinear processes, using a quantum theory\nwhich describes these second-order nonlinear interactions. As an example, we\nshow how photonic crystals shape both the spectral and spatial characteristics\nof X-rays emitted through X-ray to optical parametric down-conversion, leading\nto a fill-factor-normalized rate enhancement of 2.2 over an unstructured\nmedium, in addition to control over the directionality of X-ray emission. The\nability to control X-ray nonlinear processes may lead to more monochromatic,\nheralded X-ray sources, enhanced ghost imaging of lattice and electronic\ndynamics, and imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. Our\nframework illuminates a path towards controlling quantum optical effects at\nX-ray frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling\nrobust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on\ntraining and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to\ncreate data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of\nthe original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The\nobjective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based\ncross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different\nclustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new\ncross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class\nstratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both\nbalanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing\ncross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.\nThe technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification\noutperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though\nit did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,\ntraditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing\nlower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for\nperformance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of\ndifferent clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as\nsuperior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model\nevaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of\ncluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of\nwell-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it\nhighlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model\nevaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.",
