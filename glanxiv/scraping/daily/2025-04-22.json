    "abstract": "The disruption of protein structures by denaturants like urea is well\nstudied, though its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using Molecular\nDynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated how urea affects the structural\nstability of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at concentrations from 0 M to 5 M. Our\nresults reveal that urea induces a dehydration/rehydration cycle, characterized\nby displacement and partial replacement of water molecules in BSAs hydration\nshell. At low concentrations, urea reduces protein/water hydrogen bonds while\nenhancing protein-urea interactions. At higher concentrations, urea aggregation\nlimits these interactions, promoting rehydration and changes in tertiary\nstructure, while secondary structure remains largely intact. These findings\nprovide insights into the mechanisms of protein denaturation and stability by\nurea.",

Instead, we propose and formally define federated\ncoherence, a model that provides coherence only within nodes, not across nodes.\nFederated coherence can use current intra-node coherence provided by processors\nwithout requiring expensive mechanisms for inter-node coherence.

Recent studies have\nshown that LSNs are capable of providing unprecedented download capacity and\nlow latency to support Livecast viewing. However, Livecast ingestion still\nfaces significant challenges, such as limited uplink capacity, bandwidth\ndegradation, and the burst of packet loss due to frequent satellite\nreallocations, which cause previous recovery and adaptive solutions to be\ninferior under this new scenario. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth\nmeasurement study dedicated to understanding the implications of satellite\nreallocations, which reveals that the network status during reallocations with\nnetwork anomalies exhibits a different distribution, leading to bimodal\nbehaviors on the overall network performance. Motivated by this finding, we\npropose BAROC, a framework that can effectively conceal burst packet losses by\ncombining a novel proposed MTP-Informer with bimodal behavior awareness during\nsatellite reallocation. BAROC enhances video QoE on the server side by\naddressing the above challenges and jointly determining the optimal video\nencoding and recovery parameters.

For any $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, a $(1\n\\pm \\epsilon)$ hypergraph cut-sparsifier of a hypergraph $H$ is a reweighted\nsubgraph $H'$ whose cut values approximate those of $H$ to within a $(1 \\pm\n\\epsilon)$ factor. Prior work shows that in the static setting, one can\nconstruct a $(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$ hypergraph cut-sparsifier using\n$\\tilde{O}(nr/\\epsilon^2)$ bits of space [Chen-Khanna-Nagda FOCS 2020], and in\nthe setting of dynamic streams using $\\tilde{O}(nr\\log m/\\epsilon^2)$ bits of\nspace [Khanna-Putterman-Sudan FOCS 2024]; here the $\\tilde{O}$ notation hides\nterms that are polylogarithmic in $n$, and we use $m$ to denote the total\nnumber of hyperedges in the hypergraph. Up until now, the best known space\ncomplexity for insertion-only streams has been the same as that for the dynamic\nstreams. This naturally poses the question of understanding the complexity of\nhypergraph sparsification in insertion-only streams.\n  Perhaps surprisingly, in this work we show that in \\emph{insertion-only}\nstreams, a $(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$ cut-sparsifier can be computed in\n$\\tilde{O}(nr/\\epsilon^2)$ bits of space, \\emph{matching the complexity} of the\nstatic setting. As a consequence, this also establishes an $\\Omega(\\log m)$\nfactor separation between the space complexity of hypergraph cut sparsification\nin insertion-only streams and dynamic streams, as the latter is provably known\nto require $\\Omega(nr \\log m)$ bits of space.",

However, most\nexisting methods are based on the point clouds (2.5D points) generated from\nsingle-view depth images. These point clouds only have one surface side of the\nobject providing incomplete geometry information, which mislead the grasping\nalgorithm to judge the shape of the target object, resulting in low grasping\naccuracy. Humans can accurately grasp objects from a single view by leveraging\ntheir geometry experience to estimate object shapes. Inspired by humans, we\npropose a novel 6-DoF grasping framework that converts the point completion\nresults as object shape features to train the 6-DoF grasp network. Here, point\ncompletion can generate approximate complete points from the 2.5D points\nsimilar to the human geometry experience, and converting it as shape features\nis the way to utilize it to improve grasp efficiency. Furthermore, due to the\ngap between the network generation and actual execution, we integrate a score\nfilter into our framework to select more executable grasp proposals for the\nreal robot. This enables our method to maintain a high grasp quality in any\ncamera viewpoint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that utilizing complete\npoint features enables the generation of significantly more accurate grasp\nproposals and the inclusion of a score filter greatly enhances the credibility\nof real-world robot grasping.

This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign\nrecognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple\nhuman activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss\ncomponent based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track\npose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information\nsources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens\nSegmentation--into a single latent pose representation.

To address this issue, we\npropose the creation of a synthetic dataset consisting of vulnerability-focused\nreviews that specifically comment on security flaws. Our approach leverages\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like code review comments for\nvulnerabilities, using insights derived from code differences and commit\nmessages. To evaluate the usefulness of the generated synthetic dataset, we\nplan to use it to fine-tune three existing code review models. We anticipate\nthat the synthetic dataset will improve the performance of the original code\nreview models.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference\n(SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate\na SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at\nsuppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in\nthe far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical\nconstraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as\nwell as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication\ndirection. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords\nare iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When\nthe TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can\nbe formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem.\nUsing Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of\nsubproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective\nfunction are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are\nthen efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall\napproach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX\ncodeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem,\nwhereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be\nconsidered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed\nby the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as\nFP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX\ncodebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS\nachieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive\nsearch method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating\noptimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.",

Since we consider segregation to\nbe key for the development of political polarisation, we are interested in what\ninsights it could give for this problem. We tested basic questions of\nsegregation on an agent-based social network model where agents' connections\nwere not restricted by their spatial position, and made the network graph much\ndenser than previous tests of Schelling segregation in social networks.\n  We found that a dense social network does not become as strongly segregated\nas a sparse network, and that agents' numbers of same-group neighbours do not\ngreatly exceed their desired numbers (i.e. they do not end up more segregated\nthan they desire to be). Furthermore, we found that the network was very\ndifficult to polarise when one group was somewhat smaller than the other, and\nthat the network became unstable when one group was extremely small; both\nphenomena may help explain the complexity of real-world polarisation dynamics,\nsuch as unique risks faced by very small group sin a society. Finally we tested\nFossett's (2006) \"paradox of weak minority preferences\", a well-established\nresult in grid- and map-based models which shows that an increase in the\nminority group's desire for same-group neighbours can create more segregation\nthan a similar increase for the majority group.

To support this, we design\n(1) a low-noise conversion protocol between bare and logical qubits, (2) a\nbare-logical hybrid instruction set architecture tailored for 2D grid-based\nTIQC, and (3) a compiler that minimizes conversion cost and optimizes the\nscheduling efficiency.

In this\nwork, we ray trace photons from a current sheet near the black hole event\nhorizon during a flux eruption in a magnetically arrested state in a general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation.

We find that most of the flux originates in the\ninner $5$ gravitational radii, and beaming is essential to explain the observed\nflux from the strongest VHE flares. The ray traced lightcurves show features\nresulting from the changing volume of the reconnecting current sheet on\ntimescales that can be consistent with observations.

    "abstract": "Visual-vestibular conflicts (VVCs) are a primary contributor to visually\ninduced motion sickness (VIMS) in head-mounted displays (HMDs). However,\nvirtual reality (VR) comfort studies often rely on exposing seated or standing\nusers to experiences with high intensity visual motion (such as roller\ncoasters). These drastic VVCs tend to induce pronounced VIMS symptoms that can\nbe reliably detected across individuals using common survey measures. The\nconclusions from studies using these extreme motion-based conflicts may not\naccurately generalize to naturalistic use cases in VR where efforts are made to\nminimize, rather than maximize, VIMS symptoms. In this work, we show that a\nsubthreshold visual-vestibular conflict can induce measurable discomfort during\nnaturalistic, long duration use. We first present a psychophysical study,\nconducted outside of an HMD, to rigorously identify the perceptual thresholds\nfor sinusoidal noise in render pose (i.e., jitter) resulting in erroneous 3D\nmotion of rendered content. We next introduce subthreshold levels of jitter to\na Meta Quest 3 VR HMD and demonstrate that this can induce visual discomfort in\nparticipants playing the commercially-available game Cubism across a\nthree-session, repeated-measures study. Importantly, we did not identify\nstatistically significant comfort differences between control and jitter\nconditions with traditional pre- and post-test comparison of Simulator Sickness\nQuestionnaire (SSQ) scores. Significant differences were only identified using\nthe Motion Illness Symptoms Classification (MISC) survey administered every 10\nminutes across each 90 minute session. This highlights the benefits of\nincorporating time-resolved data points and suggests that lightweight, more\nfrequent surveys may be important tools for measuring visual discomfort in more\necologically-valid scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In ordinal classification, misclassifying neighboring ranks is common, yet\nthe consequences of these errors are not the same. For example, misclassifying\nbenign tumor categories is less consequential, compared to an error at the\npre-cancerous to cancerous threshold, which could profoundly influence\ntreatment choices. Despite this, existing ordinal classification methods do not\naccount for the varying importance of these margins, treating all neighboring\nclasses as equally significant. To address this limitation, we propose CLOC, a\nnew margin-based contrastive learning method for ordinal classification that\nlearns an ordered representation based on the optimization of multiple margins\nwith a novel multi-margin n-pair loss (MMNP). CLOC enables flexible decision\nboundaries across key adjacent categories, facilitating smooth transitions\nbetween classes and reducing the risk of overfitting to biases present in the\ntraining data. We provide empirical discussion regarding the properties of MMNP\nand show experimental results on five real-world image datasets (Adience,\nHistorical Colour Image Dating, Knee Osteoarthritis, Indian Diabetic\nRetinopathy Image, and Breast Carcinoma Subtyping) and one synthetic dataset\nsimulating clinical decision bias. Our results demonstrate that CLOC\noutperforms existing ordinal classification methods and show the\ninterpretability and controllability of CLOC in learning meaningful, ordered\nrepresentations that align with clinical and practical needs.",

This novel radio pulsar survey revisits the full Northern Sky daily,\noffering unprecedented opportunity to detect highly intermittent pulsars, as\nwell as faint sources via long-term data stacking. CHAMPSS uses the CHIME/FRB\ndatastream, which consists of 1024 stationary beams streaming intensity data at\n$0.983$\\,ms resolution, 16384 frequency channels across 400--800\\,MHz,\ncontinuously being searched for single, dispersed bursts/pulses. In CHAMPSS,\ndata from adjacent east-west beams are combined to form a grid of tracking\nbeams, allowing longer exposures at fixed positions. These tracking beams are\ndedispersed to many trial dispersion measures (DM) to a maximum DM beyond the\nMilky Way's expected contribution, and Fourier transformed in time to form\npower spectra. Repeated observations are searched daily to find intermittent\nsources, and power spectra of the same sky positions are incoherently stacked,\nincreasing sensitivity to faint persistent sources. The $0.983$\\,ms time\nresolution limits our sensitivity to millisecond pulsars; we have full\nsensitivity to pulsars with $P > 60\\,$ms, with sensitivity gradually decreasing\nfrom $60$ ms to $2$\\,ms as higher harmonics are beyond the Nyquist limit. In a\ncommissioning survey, data covering $\\sim 1/16$ of the CHIME sky was processed\nand searched in quasi-realtime over two months, leading to the discovery of\neleven new pulsars, each with $S_{600} > 0.1$\\,mJy.

    "abstract": "Context: Software developers often ask questions on Technical Q&A forums like\nStack Overflow (SO) to seek solutions to their programming-related problems\n(e.g., errors and unexpected behavior of code). Problem: Many questions miss\nrequired code snippets due to the lack of readily available code, time\nconstraints, employer restrictions, confidentiality concerns, or uncertainty\nabout what code to share. Unfortunately, missing but required code snippets\nprevent questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. Objective: We\nplan to introduce GENCNIPPET, a tool designed to integrate with SO's question\nsubmission system. GENCNIPPET will generate relevant code examples (when\nrequired) to support questions for their timely solutions. Methodology: We\nfirst downloaded the SO April 2024 data dump, which contains 1.94 million\nquestions related to Python that have code snippets and 1.43 million questions\nrelated to Java. Then, we filter these questions to identify those that\ngenuinely require code snippets using a state-of-the-art machine learning\nmodel. Next, we select questions with positive scores to ensure high-quality\ndata. Our plan is to fine-tune Llama-3 models (e.g., Llama-3-8B), using 80% of\nthe selected questions for training and 10% for validation. The primary reasons\nfor choosing Llama models are their open-source accessibility and robust\nfine-tuning capabilities, which are essential for deploying a freely accessible\ntool. GENCNIPPET will be integrated with the SO question submission system as a\nbrowser plugin. It will communicate with the fine-tuned model to generate code\nsnippets tailored to the target questions. The effectiveness of the generated\ncode examples will be assessed using automatic evaluation against ground truth,\nuser perspectives, and live (wild) testing in real-world scenarios.",

This work\ninvestigates ResNet18 with a particular focus on its residual stream, an\narchitectural component which InceptionV1 lacks. We observe that many\nconvolutional channels in intermediate blocks exhibit scale invariant\nproperties, computed by the element-wise residual summation of scale\nequivariant representations: the block input's smaller-scale copy with the\nblock pre-sum output's larger-scale copy. Through subsequent ablation\nexperiments, we attempt to causally link these neural properties with\nscale-robust object recognition behavior.

Many disciplines in science and engineering have\nrecently witnessed a paradigm shift powered by deep learning (DL), and room\nacoustics research is no exception. The majority of deep, data-driven room\nacoustics models are inspired by DL-based speech and image processing, and\nhence lack the intrinsic space-time structure of acoustic wave propagation.\nMore recently, DL-based models for room acoustics that include either geometric\nor wave-based information have delivered promising results, primarily for the\nproblem of sound field reconstruction. In this review paper, we will provide an\nextensive and structured literature review on deep, data-driven modeling in\nroom acoustics.

We uncovered a dramatic impact of the environment on\nAGN triggering as dwarfs from high-density environments showed an AGN fraction\nof 22.5\\%, while the median stellar mass of this subset of dwarfs is only\nlog(M$_*$/\\(M_\\odot\\))=8.1. In contrast, the low-density environment dwarfs\nshowed an AGN fraction of only 1.4\\%, in line with typically reported values\nfrom the literature. This highlights the fact that massive central black holes\nare ubiquitous even at the lowest mass scales and demonstrates the importance\nof the environment in triggering black hole accretion, as well as the necessity\nfor deep X-ray data and proper evaluation of the X-ray data quality.\nAlternatively, even if the detected X-ray sources are related to stellar mass\naccretors rather than AGN, the environmental dependence persists, signaling the\nimpact of the environment on galaxy evolution and star formation processes at\nthe lowest mass scales. Additionally, we stacked the X-ray images of\nnon-detected galaxies from high- and low-density environments, revealing\nsimilar trends.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation highlights the contributions I have made to the field of\ntheoretical nuclear physics, specifically in high-energy Quantum Chromodynamics\n(QCD). High-energy QCD is a robust subject and my research is refined to the\nsub-field of small-$x$ spin physics; small-$x$ physics is characterized by\nhigh-energy and density collisions and is well-suited for the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory. Small-$x$ spin physics takes the\nultra-relativistic description of high-energy QCD and gives special attention\nto spin-dependent interactions suppressed by powers of the center-of-mass\nenergy. My expertise lies in exploring the theory and phenomenology relating to\nthe KPS-CTT small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, a rubric that allows one to\nmake predictions of the quarks' and gluons' distributions of spin at small-$x$.\nThese predictions are heavily influenced by the initial conditions of the\nevolution, and the initial conditions are determined through analyses of world\npolarized data. My contributions focus on Bayesian parameter analysis,\nnumerical and analytical calculations to discretize and cross-check the\nevolution equations, and the incorporation of a new observable into the pool of\nanalyzed data. The results of such work show that the net amount of spin from\nquarks and gluons in the small-$x$ regime is predicted to be negative and/or\npotentially small; an analysis of polarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and\nsemi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) data resulted in a net small-$x$ spin prediction\nthat can be large and negative, but new results with the inclusion of data for\nsingle-inclusive jet production in polarized proton-proton ($pp$) collisions\nnow estimate that the net amount of parton spin at small $x$ is small, with\n1-$\\sigma$ uncertainty that spans zero.",

We evaluate publicly available models for\nrecognizing categorical and dimensional affect from speech on a dataset of\natypical speech, comparing results to datasets of typical speech. We\ninvestigate three dimensions of speech atypicality: intelligibility, which is\nrelated to pronounciation; monopitch, which is related to prosody, and\nharshness, which is related to voice quality. We look at (1) distributional\ntrends of categorical affect predictions within the dataset, (2) distributional\ncomparisons of categorical affect predictions to similar datasets of typical\nspeech, and (3) correlation strengths between text and speech predictions for\nspontaneous speech for valence and arousal. We find that the output of affect\nmodels is significantly impacted by the presence and degree of speech\natypicalities. For instance, the percentage of speech predicted as sad is\nsignificantly higher for all types and grades of atypical speech when compared\nto similar typical speech datasets. In a preliminary investigation on improving\nrobustness for atypical speech, we find that fine-tuning models on\npseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech\nwithout impacting performance on typical speech.

A soft end-point optimal control problem is\nintroduced whose minimum measures the minimal control norm required to align an\ninitial shape to a final shape, up to a small error term. The initial data is\nspatially integrable, the paths in control spaces are integrable and the\nevolution equation is a generalized convective Allen-Cahn. Binary images are\nused to represent shapes for the initial data. Inspired by level-set methods\nand large diffeomorphic deformation metric mapping, the controls spaces are\nintegrable scalar functions to serve as a normal velocity and smooth\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to serve as velocity vector fields. The\nexistence of mild solutions to the evolution equation is proved, the minimums\nof the time discretized optimal control problem are characterized, and\nnumerical simulations of minimums to the fully discretized optimal control\nproblem are displayed.

However, Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible\nw.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been\nproven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a\nnovel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue.\nMotivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum\ndoubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the\nself-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the\nexpressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that\nbetter preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple\nsmall-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently\nsurpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic\nTransformers.

Our experiments show that achieving a better balance of token-level\nreward attribution leads to performance improvements over baselines on\ndownstream tasks and finds an optimal policy faster during training.\nFurthermore, we show theoretically that explainability methods that are feature\nadditive attribution functions maintain the optimal policy as the original\nreward.",

However,\nthe decentralized nature of blockchain also exposes it to vulnerabilities,\nparticularly Byzantine faults, which arise when nodes in the network behave\nmaliciously or encounter unexpected failures. Such incidents can result in\ninconsistencies within the blockchain and, in extreme scenarios, lead to a\nbreakdown in consensus. Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are\ncrafted to tackle this challenge by ensuring that network nodes can agree on\nthe blockchain's state even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. To\nbolster the system's resilience against these faults, it is imperative to\ndetect them within the system. However, our examination of existing literature\nreveals a prevalent assumption: solutions typically operate under constraints\nregarding the number of faulty nodes. Such constraints confine the proposed\nsolutions to ideal environments, limiting their practical applicability. In\nresponse, we propose a novel approach inspired by social paradigms, employing a\ntrusted and fully monitored communication sub-process to detect Byzantine\nnodes. Upon detection, these nodes can be either disregarded in the\nconsensus-building process, subjected to penalties, or undergo modifications as\nper the system's policy. Finally, we statistically demonstrate that our\napproach achieves a detection probability that exceeds 95\\% for Byzantine\nnodes. In essence, our methodology ensures that if Byzantine nodes exhibit\nmalicious behavior, healthy nodes can identify them with a confidence level of\n95\\%.",

    "abstract": "Rare events are essential for understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium\nand industrial systems. It is of ongoing interest to develop methods for\neffectively searching for rare events. With the advent of quantum computing and\nits potential advantages over classical computing for applications like\nsampling certain probability distributions, the question arises whether quantum\ncomputers could also provide an advantage or inspire new methods for sampling\nthe statistics of rare events. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement\nlearning (QRL) method for studying rare dynamics, and we investigate their\nbenefits over classical approaches based on neural networks. As a\nproof-of-concept example, we demonstrate that our QRL agents can learn and\ngenerate the rare dynamics of random walks, and we are able to explain this\nsuccess as well as the different contributing factors to it via the intrinsic\nFourier features of the parameterized quantum circuit. Furthermore, we show\nbetter learning behavior with fewer parameters compared to classical\napproaches. This is the first investigation of QRL applied to generating rare\nevents and suggests that QRL is a promising method to study their dynamics and\nstatistics.",

    "abstract": "Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse\nproblem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which\nis obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the\none-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the\nscattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the\nGalactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its\neffect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We\nexploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization\nlandscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen\naffecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a\nwide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230\nGHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz.\nOur analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in\nimaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in\nweakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The\nsuccessful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event\nhorizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the\nstudy of the scattering screen itself.",

To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required\nto define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating\nNatural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack\ncorrectness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL\ntranslation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined\ntranslation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL\nformulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary\nQuestion-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware\ntranslation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free\nuncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to\nassess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with\ntranslation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide\nboth theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL\nachieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.",

    "abstract": "In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically\nlocally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols.\nWhile many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error\ncorrection and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement.\nThese LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products\nof irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker\nsubspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker\nsubspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A\nquantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration\nprotocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of\nmultiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the\nmultiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that\napproach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction\ncalled W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as\ntensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition\nof copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be\nconstructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can\ngenerate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and\nfour-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a\nvaluable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may\nopen new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with\nbipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic\nanalysis based on Kronecker states.",

The accuracy of the computed derivative\nvalues depends on the precision and reliability of the numerical routines used\nto evaluate these inner products.\n  The projection coefficients offer valuable insights into certain properties\nof analytic functions, such as whether they are odd or even, and whether the $\nn $-th derivatives exist at a given point $ z_0 $. Due to its relevance to\nquantum theory, our approach establishes a correspondence between quantum\ncircuits derived from quantum systems and the theory of analytic functions.\nThis study lays the groundwork for further applications in numerical analysis\nand approximation theory within Hilbert spaces equipped with Gaussian measures.\nAdditionally, it holds potential for advancing fields such as quantum\ncomputing, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods -- which are widely\nused in support vector machines (SVM) and other areas of machine learning --\nand probabilistic numerics.",

On the one hand, we present a\nphysical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the\nsuperfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state\ncharge carriers forming the Cooper pairs.

In recent years, FSO laser links have been\ndemonstrated, tested or integrated in a range of environments and scenarios.\nThese include FSO links for terrestrial communication, between ground stations\nand cube-sats in low Earth orbit, between ground and satellite in lunar orbit,\nas part of scientific or commercial space relay networks, and deep space\ncommunications beyond the moon.

    "abstract": "The tubal tensor framework provides a clean and effective algebraic setting\nfor tensor computations, supporting matrix-mimetic features like Singular Value\nDecomposition and Eckart-Young-like optimality results. Underlying the tubal\ntensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In\nthis work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working\nwith tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements\nfrom a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important\ndesired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a\nunit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes\nwhich are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this\nissue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of\nbounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural\nproperties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to\nlaying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite\ndimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and\nprovide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional\napproximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory. We\nbelieve our theory opens new exciting avenues for applying matrix mimetic\ntensor framework in the context of inherently infinite dimensional problems.",

It is\ntypically the case that patients with incomplete eligibility information are\nexcluded from analysis without consideration of (implicit) assumptions that are\nbeing made, leaving study conclusions subject to potential selection bias. In\nan effort to ascertain eligibility for more patients, researchers may look back\nfurther in time prior to study baseline, and in using outdated values of\neligibility-defining covariates may inappropriately be including individuals\nwho, unbeknownst to the researcher, fail to meet eligibility at baseline. To\nthe best of our knowledge, however, very little work has been done to mitigate\nthese concerns. We propose a robust and efficient estimator of the causal\naverage treatment effect on the treated, defined in the study eligible\npopulation, in cohort studies where eligibility-defining covariates are missing\nat random. The approach facilitates the use of flexible machine-learning\nstrategies for component nuisance functions while maintaining appropriate\nconvergence rates for valid asymptotic inference.

    "abstract": "Federated learning has become a promising distributed learning concept with\nextra insurance on data privacy. Extensive studies on various models of\nFederated learning have been done since the coinage of its term. One of the\nimportant derivatives of federated learning is hierarchical semi-decentralized\nfederated learning, which distributes the load of the aggregation task over\nmultiple nodes and parallelizes the aggregation workload at the breadth of each\nlevel of the hierarchy. Various methods have also been proposed to perform\ninter-cluster and intra-cluster aggregation optimally. Most of the solutions,\nnonetheless, require monitoring the nodes' performance and resource consumption\nat each round, which necessitates frequently exchanging systematic data. To\noptimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on\nsystematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nmethod that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the\nprocessing delay. Our simulation results show that PSO-based placement can find\nthe optimal placement relatively fast, even in scenarios with many clients as\ncandidates for aggregation. Our real-world docker-based implementation of\nFlag-Swap over the recently emerged FL framework shows superior performance\ncompared to black-box-based deterministic placement strategies, with about 43%\nminutes faster than random placement, and 32% minutes faster than uniform\nplacement, in terms of total processing time.",

To address this gap, we introduce Multi-modal Cancer Detection\nNetwork (MMDCNet) that integrates visual cues with clinical data to improve\nbreast cancer detection. Our approach processes medical images using computer\nvision techniques while structured patient metadata patterns are learned\nthrough a custom fully connected network.

TVC leverages the powerful Cosmos video\ntokenizer to extract both discrete and continuous token streams.

The masked tokens\nare reconstructed by a decoder-only transformer with spatiotemporal token\nprediction.

At the\nDecoder side, both streams are fused using ControlNet, with multi-scale\nhierarchical integration to ensure high perceptual quality alongside strong\nfidelity in reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of\nembedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence\nembeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit\ntheir ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on\ncontinuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\\\"obius strip\n-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential\ngeometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning\nof embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.\n  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare\nit to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained\nKeras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained\nembeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\\\"obius strips,\nsignificantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality\n(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings\nhighlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological\nstructure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically\ngrounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.",

    "abstract": "Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical framework for\nensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems serve society's\nneeds while minimizing potential harms. As generative AI applications become\nincreasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with\nthem through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability,\nand transparency. This article examines how strategic prompt engineering can\nembed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI\ninteractions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This\narticle proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering\nthat encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system\nselection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management.\nDrawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can\nbe leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential\nrisks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a\ndelicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness,\ncombining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced\nunderstanding of social impact. Through examination of real-world and emerging\npractices, the article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as\na crucial bridge between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations\nto fine-tune AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This\napproach aligns with broader \"Responsibility by Design\" principles, embedding\nethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than\ntreating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key\nresearch directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of\nresponsible prompt engineering.",

We simulate resolved stellar populations of\nMilky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters over a wide range of\nsizes, luminosities, and heliocentric distances, which are broadly consistent\nwith expectations for the Milky Way satellite system. We inject simulated stars\ninto the DC2 catalog with realistic photometric uncertainties and star/galaxy\nseparation derived from the DC2 data itself. We assess the probability that\neach simulated system would be detected by LSST using a conventional isochrone\nmatched-filter technique. We find that assuming perfect star/galaxy separation\nenables the detection of resolved stellar systems with $M_V$ = 0 mag and\n$r_{1/2}$ = 10 pc with >50% efficiency out to a heliocentric distance of ~250\nkpc. Similar detection efficiency is possible with a simple star/galaxy\nseparation criterion based on measured quantities, although the false positive\nrate is higher due to leakage of background galaxies into the stellar sample.\nWhen assuming perfect star/galaxy classification and a model for the\ngalaxy-halo connection fit to current data, we predict that 89 +/- 20 Milky Way\nsatellite galaxies will be detectable with a simple matched-filter algorithm\napplied to the LSST wide-fast-deep data set. Different assumptions about the\nperformance of star/galaxy classification efficiency can decrease this estimate\nby ~7%-25%, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality star/galaxy\nseparation for studies of the Milky Way satellite population with LSST.",

Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the\nhalo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and\ntest them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al.\n2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\\rm halo}$ where $E_{\\rm sol\n(halo)}$ and $M_{\\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton\n(halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is\nparametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022,\nand it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation\nhas been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\\rm\nsol}=E_{\\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo\nenergy can be estimated reliably.

    "abstract": "The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional\ntopologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat\nspace-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the\nproperties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can\nmimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the\nimpact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems\nremains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of\nthe SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show,\nusing different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a\ntopological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase\ncan host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike\nthe usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition\npoint, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the\nboundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves\neven a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start\nbouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended\nversion of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases\ncharacterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a\nsimilar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all\ntopological transition points between any two distinct phases.

The maximum index modulation reaches\nabout 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and\noff switching occurs within 2.5 nanoseconds, with switching energy at\nfemtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic\npeak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered\nCoulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new\ndirection for developing high-speed, non-volatile optical memories and highly\nefficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices.

We find that the total number of satellites, total\nmass of satellites, number of massive satellites and stellar mass of the most\nmassive satellite, all correlate with the cold gas mass in halos. The total\nnumber of satellites (stellar mass of the most massive satellite) correlates\nmost with the halo cold gas mass for low (middle) mass halos. The number of\nmassive or observable satellites correlates with cold gas mass in similar\nmanner as the total number of satellites. Our findings can, therefore, be used\nto guide future observers to focus on the link between the number of observable\nsatellites and the amount of cold gas in a halo. Despite this correlation, we\nfind that much of the cold gas lies far from the satellites. This leads us to\nconclude that satellites are unlikely to be the main supplier for cold gas in\nhalos, however we discuss how they may act in tandem with other sources such\nthat the satellite population correlates with the total cold gas in their host\nhalo.",

In validations against\ndensity, temperature, and bolometry measurements, the simulations show good\nagreement and reproduce the detached divertor conditions observed in the\nexperiment. Neutral gas is critical for achieving detachment and modulating the\nheight of the XPR front, in agreement with previous SOLPS-ITER transport\nmodeling and analytical power balance studies. In addition, the front structure\nis highly dynamic due to turbulence, consisting of ionizing and radiative\nmantles surrounding intermittent cold spots of recombining plasma. Near the\ndetachment front, density and temperature fluctuation amplitudes exceed the\nbackground by more than 400 %, compared to 40 % in an attached reference case.\nThe radial electric field shifts inward, poloidal symmetry of the electrostatic\npotential is broken (inducing strong radial flows around the XPR), and radial\nparticle and heat transport into the low-field side scrape-off layer increases.\nThese effects may explain the ELM suppression observed in the H-mode XPR\nregime.",

    "abstract": "Standard statistical theory has arguably proved to be unsuitable as a basis\nfor constructing a satisfactory completely general framework for performing\nstatistical inference. For example, frequentist theory has never come close to\nproviding such a general inferential framework, which is not only attributable\nto the question surrounding the soundness of this theory, but also to its focus\non attempting to address the problem of how to perform statistical inference\nonly in certain special cases. Also, theories of inference that are grounded in\nthe idea of deducing sample-based inferences about populations of interest from\na given set of universally acceptable axioms, e.g. many theories that aim to\njustify Bayesian inference and theories of imprecise probability, suffer from\nthe difficulty of finding such axioms that are weak enough to be widely\nacceptable, but strong enough to lead to methods of inference that can be\nregarded as being efficient. These observations justify the need to look for an\nalternative means by which statistical inference may be performed, and in\nparticular, to explore the one that is offered by analogy making. What is\npresented here goes down this path. To be clear, this is done in a way that\ndoes not simply endorse the common use of analogy making as a supplementary\nmeans of understanding how statistical methods work, but formally develops\nanalogy making as the foundation of a general framework for performing\nstatistical inference. In the latter part of the paper, the use of this\nframework is illustrated by applying some of the most important analogies\ncontained within it to a relatively simple but arguably still unresolved\nproblem of statistical inference, which naturally leads to an original way\nbeing put forward of addressing issues that relate to Bartlett's and Lindley's\nparadoxes.",

Performance of sensitivity is driven by the number of\nevents, while that of specificity is driven by the number of non-events.

In this work, we propose a new line-search method called\nConstrained Gradient Descent (CGD) that implicitly changes the landscape of the\nobjective function for efficient optimization. CGD is formulated as a solution\nto the constrained version of the original problem where the constraint is on a\nfunction of the gradient.

This\nresults in a line search procedure where the Lagrangian penalty acts as a\ncontrol over the descent direction and can therefore be used to iterate over\npoints that have smaller gradient values, compared to iterates of vanilla\nsteepest descent. We establish global linear convergence rates for CGD and\nprovide numerical experiments on synthetic test functions to illustrate the\nperformance of CGD.

Crucially, available free unpaired external\ntext, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues\nif semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we\nintroduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports,\neliminating paired data requirement.

These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type,\nform pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact\nalignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during\ntraining, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between\nunaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is\nused, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free\nmultimodal deployment.

However, the\ndevelopment of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to\nsupport multiple applications remains a significant challenge.\n  This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that\nlearns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest.\nOmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user\nsequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively\nprocess graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the\ntraining and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure\ncapable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal\nrepresentations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user\nexperiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide\nrepins (saves) across five applications.

We used new JVLA 1.5 GHz,\narchival GMRT 325 MHz, and XMM-Newton data to investigate the nature of the\nradio emission and the dynamical state of the intracluster medium. Our X-ray\nsurface brightness analysis revealed an azimuthally asymmetric excess extending\nto 650 kpc from the center, possibly related to the sloshing spiral, although\nthe existing data did not allow us to confirm the presence of a cold front. We\nalso detected a previously unknown galaxy group located 1 Mpc northwest of the\ncluster. Its X-ray emission was well fitted by a $\\beta$-model\n($\\beta$=0.52$\\pm$0.17), and the spectral analysis revealed a thermal plasma\ntemperature kT=1.08$\\pm$0.08 keV and metallicity Z=0.13$\\pm$0.06 Z$_{\\odot}$.\nWe investigated the possibility that this group acted as the perturber that\ntriggered the sloshing in Abell 795, and we showed that the velocity\ndistribution of member galaxies supports the dynamically unrelaxed nature of\nAbell 795. The analysis of JVLA 1.5 GHz and GMRT 325 MHz images confirmed the\npresence of extended radio emission with largest linear size 200 kpc,\npreferentially extended toward southwest and terminating in a sub-component\n(\"SW blob\"). We measured the spectral indices, finding\n$\\alpha_{Ext}$=-2.24$\\pm$0.13 for the diffuse extended emission, and\n$\\alpha_{SWb}$=-2.10$\\pm$0.13 for the SW blob. These ultra-steep spectral index\nvalues, coupled with the complex morphology and cospatiality with the\nradio-loud AGN present in the BCG, suggest that this emission could be\nclassified as a radio phoenix, possibly arising from adiabatic compression of\nan ancient AGN radio lobe due to the presence of sloshing motions.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and\nelectrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many\nastrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional\nreduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating\nModel'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on\nplasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are\nimportant because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which\ndivides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different\nproperties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a\nhelicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small\n(perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to\nsignificant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked\nsteepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In\nthe second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the\ncascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep\n`transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We\nformulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to\nsimulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies\nto construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function\nof beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of\nlow-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties\nat large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and\nion heating.",

An angle-shaped\ndevice in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning,\ncan lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial\nphases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully\ndesigned devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show\nthat Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless,\nand the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum.

    "abstract": "The LMC's stellar bar is offset from the outer disk center, tilted from the\ndisk plane, and does not drive gas inflows. These properties are atypical of\nbars in gas-rich galaxies, yet the LMC bar's strength and radius are similar to\ntypical barred galaxies. Using N-body hydrodynamic simulations, we show that\nthe LMC's unusual bar is explainable if there was a recent collision (impact\nparameter $\\approx$2 kpc) between the LMC and SMC. Pre-collision, the simulated\nbar is centered and co-planar. Post-collision, the simulated bar is offset\n($\\approx$1.5 kpc) and tilted ($\\approx8.6^\\circ$). The simulated bar offset\nreduces with time, and comparing with the observed offset ($\\approx0.8$ kpc)\nsuggests the timing of the true collision to be 150-200 Myr ago. 150 Myr\npost-collision, the LMC's bar is centered with its dark matter halo, whereas\nthe outer disk center is separated from the dark matter center by $\\approx1$\nkpc. The SMC collision produces a tilted-ring structure for the simulated LMC,\nconsistent with observations. Post-collision, the simulated LMC bar's pattern\nspeed decreases by a factor of two. We also provide a generalizable framework\nto quantitatively compare the LMC's central gas distribution in different\nLMC-SMC interaction scenarios. We demonstrate that the SMC's torques on the\nLMC's bar during the collision are sufficient to explain the observed bar tilt,\nprovided the SMC's total mass within 2 kpc was $(0.8-2.4) \\times 10^9$\nM$_\\odot$. Therefore, the LMC bar's tilt constrains the SMC's pre-collision\ndark matter profile, and requires the SMC to be a dark matter-dominated galaxy.",

With these targets,\nwe calculate envelope mass fractions (EMF) using the GAS gianT modeL for\nInteriors (GASTLI). We find a clear split in EMF between planets with\nequilibrium temperatures below and above 1300~K, equivalent to an orbital\nperiod of $\\sim$3.5~days.

Our goal is to investigate the radio\nemission from the Ophiuchus cluster, a massive, sloshing cluster in the local\nUniverse ($z=0.0296$) that hosts a diffuse mini halo at its center. To achieve\nthis, we analyzed a 7.25 h MeerKAT L-band observation, producing sensitive\nimages at 1.28 GHz with multiple resolutions. A catalog of spectroscopically\nconfirmed cluster galaxies was used to identify and study the member galaxies\ndetected in radio. We discover thin threads of synchrotron emission embedded in\nthe mini halo, two of which may be connected to the brightest cluster galaxy.\nWe also report the first identification of jellyfish galaxies in Ophiuchus,\ndetecting six galaxies with radio continuum tails, one of which extending for\n$\\sim$64 kpc at 1.28 GHz, making it one of the longest detected at such a high\nfrequency. Finally, we propose an alternative scenario to explain the origin of\na bright amorphous radio source, previously classified as a radio phoenix,\naided by the comparison with recent simulations of radio jets undergoing kink\ninstability. In Ophiuchus thin threads have been observed within the diffuse\nemission; a similar result was obtained in Perseus, another nearby cluster\nhosting a mini halo, suggesting that these structures may be a common feature\nin this kind of sources.

This work aims to provide a full characterization of the population\nof star clusters in the W345 region, in terms of their structural, photometric,\nand kinematic properties. Clusters are then used to probe the dynamical\nproperties of the W345 region and, on a larger scale, to investigate the\nevolution of the Perseus complex. We used Gaia DR3 data to search for star\nclusters in the W345 region and characterize them in terms of their density\nstructure, ellipticity, internal dynamical state, and ages. We identified five\nstellar clusters belonging to the W345 complex. The three younger clusters are\nstill partially embedded in the gas and show evidence of expansion, while the\nolder ones cleared the surrounding gas. We also found that YSOs trace the\nparent gas structure and possibly its kinematics. Thanks to the 6D information\navailable for star clusters, we followed their orbital evolution to assess the\nformation conditions and evolution of the complex. When accounting for the\nGalactic potential, we find that the Perseus complex is not dispersing. The\nobserved expansion might be a projection effect due to stars orbiting the\nGalaxy at different velocities. In addition, we find that the LISCA I and W345\nsystems formed some $20-30$ Myr ago just a few hundred parsecs away, while\nLISCA II was originally $\\simeq 0.75-1$ kpc apart. Finally, we also assessed\nthe impact of spiral arm perturbations by constructing tailored Galactic\npotential which matches the observed Galactic spiral arm structure.

    "abstract": "Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life,\nespecially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to\nexisting pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift\naccumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting,\nwhich maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable\nnovel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this,\nwe propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically\ndesigned for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses\nusing Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in\neach video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal\nconsistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced\nthe requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose\nestimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g.\nDINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering\nenhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian\nsplatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features,\nSmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature\ncorrespondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of\nSmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves\nimpressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and\nDORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies,\nanalyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate\napplications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and\nsuper-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased\nvideo generation and related domains, including video representation learning,\nquestion answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et\nal., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which\nfocus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis\n(Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our\nwork provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on\ndiffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics,\nindustry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation.\nThis survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners\nworking at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing\ninsights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations\nthat drive this rapidly evolving field. A structured list of related works\ninvolved in this survey is also available on\nhttps://github.com/Eyeline-Research/Survey-Video-Diffusion.",

Inspired by the\nself-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose\nReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to\niteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces\nthree complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to\noptimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic\nguidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly\nprovides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous\ngenerations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a\nreflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we\nefficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion\ntransformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified\nframework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly\noutperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and\ncompute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging\ntasks.",

A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently\nsolve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from\nsub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively\nact on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study\nwhy LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we\nclosely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and\nthe knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by\nfine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales.\nOur experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and\nTic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making\nabilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing\ngap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as\n$\\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and\nself-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for\ndecision-making.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has proven effective in training sequential\nrecommendation models by incorporating self-supervised signals from augmented\nviews. Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction\nsequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their\nrepresentations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific\nintents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for\nbeauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise,\ndisrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction\nsequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may\nmislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding\nspace and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To\naddress these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive\nlearning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate\nitem sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more\nreliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first\nperforms intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build\nintent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the\ntarget interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating\npositive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive\nlearning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these\nintent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared\nto existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy\nand sparse data conditions.",

They find application to fortify various modern\nstorage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes\noffer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and\ndecoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD)\ncirculant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient\nfinite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the\navailable degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD\nrelocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC\nor MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of\nshort cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution\nwhere the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous\niteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the\ninvariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible\npartitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the\ndistribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a\nGaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to\nthe actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of\niterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the\nsize of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code\ndesign techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our\nMC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art.

Pole inflation is known to provide a unified\ndescription of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for\ninflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the\nconstraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a\nlarger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs\ninflation, and the $\\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the\nmodification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second\norder pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for\nall field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the\nlarge field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this\ntype of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan\nformalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT\ndata without spoiling the success of the $\\alpha$-attractor models.",

This process also plays a pivotal\nrole in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs).\nTraditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant\napproach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll\nparameter $\\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period --\nmarking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where\n$\\epsilon_2 \\simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection\npoints or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we\nchallenge the conventional assumption that $\\epsilon_2 \\lesssim -6$ is a\nprerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We\ndemonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can\nindeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth,\nestablishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification.\nConsequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs.\nTo illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is\nembedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying\n$\\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the\namplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs\nproduction, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological\nmissions.",

The upcoming generation of radio\ntelescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data\nreduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these\nexperiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we\ndeal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the\nclassical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the\npast, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing\nnumerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a\nnew algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the\ndata reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation\nof instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components\nfitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to\nderive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis\nfunctions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior\nreconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their\nsuperior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of\nsuper-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and\nsubminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining\nthese advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than\nthe classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic\nframework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward\nto include in future data reduction pipelines. With its accelerated convergence\nspeed, and smaller residual, Autocorr-CLEAN may be an important asset for the\ndata analysis in the future.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly influenced modern society,\nrecently in particular through significant advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, high computational and storage demands of LLMs still\nlimit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge\ndistillation addresses this challenge by training a small student model from a\nlarger teacher model. Previous research has introduced several distillation\nmethods for both generating training data and for training the student model.\nDespite their relevance, the effects of state-of-the-art distillation methods\non model performance and explainability have not been thoroughly investigated\nand compared. In this work, we enlarge the set of available methods by applying\ncritique-revision prompting to distillation for data generation and by\nsynthesizing existing methods for training. For these methods, we provide a\nsystematic comparison based on the widely used Commonsense Question-Answering\n(CQA) dataset. While we measure performance via student model accuracy, we\nemploy a human-grounded study to evaluate explainability. We contribute new\ndistillation methods and their comparison in terms of both performance and\nexplainability. This should further advance the distillation of small language\nmodels and, thus, contribute to broader applicability and faster diffusion of\nLLM technology.",

However,\ndespite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown\nthat SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to\nTransformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant\nshortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding,\nwe propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the\nlong-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery\nthat the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global\nchannels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily\nresponsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the\nkey bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths\nlargely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit\nlimitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's\npoor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the\nhidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the\naccumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first\nidentifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token\nfiltering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive\nbenchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba\nsets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly\nextending its operational range without requiring additional training.

The present work\nexplores the effect of the Coriolis force, arising due to this rotation, on the\nshear viscosity of the medium. Using the relaxation time approximation within\nthe kinetic theory framework, we analyze the parallel (\\(\\eta_{||}/s\\)),\nperpendicular (\\(\\eta_\\perp/s\\)) and Hall (\\(\\eta_\\times/s\\)) components of\nshear viscosity to entropy density ratio under rotation. The estimation of\nanisotropic shear viscosity components is carried out using hadron resonance\ngas degrees of freedom below the critical (transition) temperature and massless\npartonic degrees of freedom above this temperature. Our results show that\nrotation suppresses the shear viscosity of the medium, with the degree of\nsuppression depending on the ratio between the relaxation time and the\nrotational period. In the context of realistic heavy-ion collision experiments,\nthe temperature and angular velocity both decrease with time, and one can\nestablish a connection between them through the standard approximate cooling\nlaw.

    "abstract": "In this article, we address the inconsistency of a system of max-min fuzzy\nrelational equations by minimally modifying the matrix governing the system in\norder to achieve consistency. Our method yields consistent systems that\napproximate the original inconsistent system in the following sense: the\nright-hand side vector of each consistent system is that of the inconsistent\nsystem, and the coefficients of the matrix governing each consistent system are\nobtained by modifying, exactly and minimally, the entries of the original\nmatrix that must be corrected to achieve consistency, while leaving all other\nentries unchanged.\n  To obtain a consistent system that closely approximates the considered\ninconsistent system, we study the distance (in terms of a norm among $L_1$,\n$L_2$ or $L_\\infty$) between the matrix of the inconsistent system and the set\nformed by the matrices of consistent systems that use the same right-hand side\nvector as the inconsistent system. We show that our method allows us to\ndirectly compute matrices of consistent systems that use the same right-hand\nside vector as the inconsistent system whose distance in terms of $L_\\infty$\nnorm to the matrix of the inconsistent system is minimal (the computational\ncosts are higher when using $L_1$ norm or $L_2$ norm). We also give an explicit\nanalytical formula for computing this minimal $L_\\infty$ distance.

The experimental configuration systematically\nvaried the optimizer (Muon vs. AdamW) and the softmax activation function\n(standard softmax, stablemax, and sparsemax) to assess their combined effect on\nlearning dynamics. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the Muon optimizer,\ncharacterized by its use of spectral norm constraints and second-order\ninformation, significantly accelerates the onset of grokking compared to the\nwidely used AdamW optimizer. Specifically, Muon reduced the mean grokking epoch\nfrom 153.09 to 102.89 across all configurations, a statistically significant\ndifference (t = 5.0175, p = 6.33e-08).

    "abstract": "The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the detection of an\nultra-high-energy neutrino event, dubbed KM3-230213A. This is the first\nobserved neutrino event with energy of the order of $\\mathcal{O}(100)$PeV, the\norigin of which remains unclear. We interprete this high energy neutrino event\nresults from the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\\chi$ decay through the\nright-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for\nneutrino masses and mixings. Fruthermore, dark matter $\\chi$ is assumed to\ncharged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is sponetaneously broken by\nthe vacuum expectation value of the dark Higgs $\\Phi$. In this scenario, the DM\ncan decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles for $v_\\Phi \\gg m_\\chi$,\nwhich we assume is the case. If the DM mass is around $440$ PeV with a lifetime\n$5\\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such\nheavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to\noverproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in\nproduction of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the\nDM dominantly in the early Universe. We have also found a set of allowed\nparameter values that can correctly account for the DM relic density and decay\nlifetime required to explain the KM3NeT signal. Moreover, we have generated the\nneutrino spectra from the two-body decay using the HDMSpectra package, which\nrequires the dark Higgs vacuum expectations value (VEV) to be much larger than\nthe DM mass. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the\npossibility of generating GW spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a\nreasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield\nthe correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and\nallow for possible detection of GW at future detectors.",

We mathematically define AUV thruster fault scenarios,\nand develop the fault-tolerant control that captures the fault scenario via\nBayesian approach. Particularly, when the AUV fault type switches from one to\nanother, the developed control captures the fault states and maintains the\ncontrol by a linear quadratic tracking controller. With the captured fault\nstates by Bayesian approach, we derive the control law by aggregating the\ncontrol outputs for individual fault scenarios weighted by their Bayesian\nposterior probability. The developed fault-tolerant control works in an\nadaptive way and guarantees soft-switching across fault scenarios, and requires\nno complicated fault detection dedicated to different type of faults. The\nentailed soft-switching ensures stable AUV trajectory tracking when fault type\nshifts, which otherwise leads to reduced control under hard-switching control\nstrategies. We conduct numerical simulations with diverse AUV thruster fault\nsettings. The results demonstrate that the proposed control can provide smooth\ntransition across thruster failures, and effectively sustain AUV trajectory\ntracking control in case of thruster failures and failure shifts.",

RUST is superior to conventional\nultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is\nhigh-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and\nreceiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is\nconveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same\nregion.

    "abstract": "Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) often depend on costly human\nannotations or proprietary model APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) to produce training data,\nwhich limits their training at scale. In this paper, we explore large-scale\ntraining for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR)\ntranscripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that\ndensely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their\ntimestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with\nASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus\nenabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language\nmodeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data production\npipeline to process YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC, same as ASR),\nresulting in Live-CC-5M dataset for pre-training and Live-WhisperX-526K dataset\nfor high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, even without SFT,\nthe ASR-only pre-trained LiveCC-7B-Base model demonstrates competitive general\nvideo QA performance and exhibits a new capability in real-time video\ncommentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new LiveSports-3K\nbenchmark, using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary.\nExperiments show our final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model can surpass advanced 72B\nmodels (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, LLaVA-Video-72B) in commentary quality even\nworking in a real-time mode. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art results at\nthe 7B/8B scale on popular video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME and OVOBench,\ndemonstrating the broad generalizability of our approach.

    "abstract": "Adapter-based methods are commonly used to enhance model performance with\nminimal additional complexity, especially in video editing tasks that require\nframe-to-frame consistency.

In this work, we want to provide\na general theoretical framework for adapters that maintain frame consistency in\nDDIM-based models under a temporal consistency loss. First, we prove that the\ntemporal consistency objective is differentiable under bounded feature norms,\nand we establish a Lipschitz bound on its gradient. Second, we show that\ngradient descent on this objective decreases the loss monotonically and\nconverges to a local minimum if the learning rate is within an appropriate\nrange. Finally, we analyze the stability of modules in the DDIM inversion\nprocedure, showing that the associated error remains controlled.

In all cases studied here, heat preferentially flows from the\nporous to the pristine region and both $\\kappa$ and $\\eta$ increase upon\nincreasing the length of the pristine region and upon decreasing the size of\nthe pores. To interpret the results, the macroscopic \"R-Series Model\" is\napplied, attributing rectification to the different temperature dependence of\n$\\kappa$ of perforated and pristine graphene. According to the model, $\\eta$ is\nmaximized when the two regions composing the structure have matching thermal\nresistances and mismatching temperature-dependence of $\\kappa$. The model\nagrees qualitatively with the MD results, indicating that the latter is the\nprincipal rectification mechanism, but it can significantly underestimate\n$\\eta$. Phonon analysis further reveals the appearance of new 'defect' modes\nlocalized around and between pores, resulting in the emergence of a new\nprominent peak in the phonon Density of States at 520 $cm^{-1}$. The study\nconsiders key geometric factors such as the length of the pristine region, and\nthe pore size, shape, alignment, and orientation.

In this work, we examine\nhow in-context retrieval operates in Transformer- and SSM-based language models\nand find that both rely on a similar Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism: a\nGather Head extracts relevant information pieces from context, which an\nAggregate Head integrates into a single representation. In both architectures,\nG&A concentrates in a few heads, forming critical bottlenecks even for simple\nretrieval. For example, we show that disabling a single Gather or Aggregate\nHead in a pruned Llama-3.1-8B impairs retrieving the correct answer letter in\nMMLU, reducing its accuracy from 66% to 25% (random guessing). Moreover, this\nretrieval bottleneck can obscure limited knowledge demands of tasks as the\npruned model succeeds on MMLU with functioning G&A heads yet fails on other\nknowledge benchmarks. The bottleneck similarly extends to tasks where SSMs\ntypically underperform, such as GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue comprehension. We show\nthat SSMs' retrieval challenges manifest in these heads, creating smoother\nattention patterns instead of the sharp token transitions effective G&A\nrequires. Thus, the Transformer-SSM retrieval gap exists in just a few heads,\nrather than the entire language model. This suggests a unified explanation for\nTransformer vs. SSM performance gap while showing how to merge their strengths.\nWe find that pretrained hybrid models, where SSMs are combined with a few\nattention layers, delegate the role of Aggregate Heads to attention.

Existing research\ntypically tackles this problem through two main strategies: reducing model\nparameters and resampling inputs. However, light-weight Convolution Neural\nNetworks (CNN) and Transformers often struggle to balance efficiency with high\nperformance due to the requirement of long-range modeling capabilities.\nRecently, the state-space model, particularly Mamba, has emerged as a promising\nalternative, offering linear complexity with respect to sequence length.\nMeanwhile, efficient VQA heavily depends on resampling long sequences to\nminimize computational costs, yet current resampling methods are often weak in\npreserving essential semantic information. In this work, we present MVQA, a\nMamba-based model designed for efficient VQA along with a novel Unified\nSemantic and Distortion Sampling (USDS) approach. USDS combines semantic patch\nsampling from low-resolution videos and distortion patch sampling from\noriginal-resolution videos. The former captures semantically dense regions,\nwhile the latter retains critical distortion details. To prevent computation\nincrease from dual inputs, we propose a fusion mechanism using pre-defined\nmasks, enabling a unified sampling strategy that captures both semantic and\nquality information without additional computational burden.

The model consists of\nthe equation for conservation mass and dependencies for porosity, permeability,\nand oil density on pressure. The oil viscosity is considered to be the\nexperimentally expired parabolic relationship on pressure. To close the model,\ntwo types of Darcy law are used: the classic one and the dynamic one describing\nthe relaxation processes during filtration. In the former case, self-similar\nsolutions are studied, while in the latter case, traveling wave solutions are\nthe focus. Using the invariant solutions, the initial model is reduced to the\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations possessing the trajectories vanishing\nat infinity and representing the moving liquid fronts in porous media. To\napproximate these solutions, we elaborate the semi-analytic procedure based on\nmodified Pade approximants. In fact, we calculate sequentially Pade\napproximants up to 3d order for a two-point boundary value problem on the\nsemi-infinite domain. A good agreement of evaluated Pade approximants and\nnumerical solutions is observed. The approach provides relatively simple\nquasi-rational expressions of solutions and can be easily adapted for other\ntypes of model's nonlinearity.",

We identify two distinct\nmagnetic configurations associated with QSEBs, UV brightenings, and\nchromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets. The first involves a nested fan-spine\nstructure where, due to flux emergence, an inner 3D null forms inside fan\nsurface of an outer 3D null with some overlap. QSEBs occur at two footpoints\nalong the shared fan surface, with UV brightening located near the outer 3D\nnull point. The jet originates close to the two QSEBs and follows the path of\nhigh squashing factor Q. We discuss a comparable scenario using a numerical\nsimulation. In second case, two adjacent fan-spine topologies share fan\nfootpoints at a common positive polarity patch, with the QSEB, along with a\nchromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jet, occurring at the intersection having high\nQ values. This study demonstrates through observational and modelling support\nthat associated QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped\njets share a common origin driven by magnetic reconnection between interacting\nfan-spine topologies.",

However, existing VFL systems face critical limitations: they often\nlack effective incentive mechanisms, struggle to balance privacy-utility\ntradeoffs, and fail to accommodate clients with heterogeneous resource\ncapabilities. These challenges hinder meaningful participation, degrade model\nperformance, and limit practical deployment. To address these issues, we\npropose OPUS-VFL, an Optimal Privacy-Utility tradeoff Strategy for VFL.\nOPUS-VFL introduces a novel, privacy-aware incentive mechanism that rewards\nclients based on a principled combination of model contribution, privacy\npreservation, and resource investment. It employs a lightweight leave-one-out\n(LOO) strategy to quantify feature importance per client, and integrates an\nadaptive differential privacy mechanism that enables clients to dynamically\ncalibrate noise levels to optimize their individual utility. Our framework is\ndesigned to be scalable, budget-balanced, and robust to inference and poisoning\nattacks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and\nCIFAR-100) demonstrate that OPUS-VFL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nVFL baselines in both efficiency and robustness. It reduces label inference\nattack success rates by up to 20%, increases feature inference reconstruction\nerror (MSE) by over 30%, and achieves up to 25% higher incentives for clients\nthat contribute meaningfully while respecting privacy and cost constraints.\nThese results highlight the practicality and innovation of OPUS-VFL as a\nsecure, fair, and performance-driven solution for real-world VFL.",

Most prior research has focused on improving the correctness\nof code repair while largely overlooking the resource efficiency of the\nreasoning process itself. To address this challenge, this paper proposes three\ntargeted optimization strategies: Context Awareness, Responsibility Tuning, and\nCost Sensitive.

    "abstract": "Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from\nthe interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This\nsubclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum,\nbut is commonly characterized by a long-duration precursor before its maximum.\nInvestigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on\nthe mass-loss history of the progenitor. We present observational data of SN\n2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties\ncompared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at\napproximately Mg = -14 mag lasting for about 100 days, followed by a bright\nbump at Mg = -17 mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the\nprecursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has\nnot been observed in other cases. After reaching the peak luminosity, the light\ncurve exhibited a relatively smooth decline. While the H-alpha profile displays\ntwo velocity components (approximately 500 and 3000 km/s), a broad component\nobserved in other 09ip-like SNe was not seen, though it may emerge later. We\nsuggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM\nstructure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser\nCSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution on a more\nextended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the\ndiversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of\nevolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.",

    "abstract": "The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to\nthe development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has\nprimarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search\n(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for\nevaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing\napproaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation\nmetrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce\nweight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored\nfor lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:\nthe parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative\ncontribution exceeding $\\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.\nAdditionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize\nthe evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating\nlightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and\nSQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and\nachieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking\nevaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space.

    "abstract": "This study explores a novel approach to predicting key bug-related outcomes,\nincluding the time to resolution, time to fix, and ultimate status of a bug,\nusing data from the Bugzilla Eclipse Project. Specifically, we leverage\nfeatures available before a bug is resolved to enhance predictive accuracy. Our\nmethodology incorporates sentiment analysis to derive both an emotionality\nscore and a sentiment classification (positive or negative). Additionally, we\nintegrate the bug's priority level and its topic, extracted using a BERTopic\nmodel, as features for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP). Our findings indicate that the combination of BERTopic and\nsentiment analysis can improve certain model performance metrics. Furthermore,\nwe observe that balancing model inputs enhances practical applicability, albeit\nat the cost of a significant reduction in accuracy in most cases. To address\nour primary objectives, predicting time-to-resolution, time-to-fix, and bug\ndestiny, we employ both binary classification and exact time value predictions,\nallowing for a comparative evaluation of their predictive effectiveness.\nResults demonstrate that sentiment analysis serves as a valuable predictor of a\nbug's eventual outcome, particularly in determining whether it will be fixed.\nHowever, its utility is less pronounced when classifying bugs into more complex\nor unconventional outcome categories.",

    "abstract": "PET requires accurate, precise, and efficient scatter correction techniques.\nConventional scatter estimation typically relies on tail-fitted single-scatter\nsimulation (SSS) strategy. However, the accuracy of tail-fitted SSS is limited,\nfor example, by mismatches between the attenuation image and the PET emission\ndata or by the presence of activity outside the FOV. These shortcomings can be\naddressed using energy-based scatter estimation (EBSE), as recently proposed by\nEfthimiou et al. and Hamill et al. The aim of this work is to 1. improve the\naccuracy of EBSE by accounting for the LOR dependence of the energy spectrum of\nunscattered photons, 2. improve the computational speed of EBSE through better\ninitialization and a more efficient optimization algorithm. The proposed\nimproved EBSE method models the energy probability density function (PDF) of\nboth single and multiple scattered photons, and incorporates a\nposition-dependent energy PDF for unscattered photons. These energy PDFs form\nthe basis of two forward models used for scatter estimation based on 2D energy\nhistograms. The performance of these models were evaluated using GATE Monte\nCarlo simulations and a NEMA phantom acquisition on a GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner.\nFurthermore, we assessed the stability of EBSE across the forward models by\nvarying the number of counts in the 2D energy histograms via data mashing. EBSE\noutperformed tail-fitted SSS, particularly in regions near out-of-FOV activity.\nOur GATE simulations showed that incorporating a local energy for unscattered\nphotons improves off-center regional quantification by approximately 2% points.\nAdditionally, improved initialization combined with the NEGML optimizer\nenabling execution on a mashed TOF sinogram in 12 minutes on six-core CPU. The\nproposed method enhances both the accuracy and computational efficiency of\nEBSE, making it well-suited for clinical applications.",

To achieve this, we deploy several stationary UAVs\nin optimized locations to collect data from industrial IoT devices, which were\nused to monitor multiple physical entities and perform computations to evaluate\ntheir status. We consider a practical setup in which multiple IoT devices may\nmonitor a single physical entity, and as a result, the measurements are\ncombined and processed together to determine the status of the physical entity.\nThe resulting status updates are subsequently uploaded from the UAVs to the\nbase station, where the DT resides.

While broad in scope, such results reveal\nlittle about advantages arising from the learning process itself. In\ncryptographic settings, further insight is possible via random-generatability -\nthe ability to classically generate labeled data - enabling hardness proofs for\nidentification tasks, where the goal is to identify the labeling function from\na dataset, even when evaluation is classically intractable. These tasks are\nparticularly relevant in quantum contexts, including Hamiltonian learning and\nidentifying physically meaningful order parameters. However, for quantum\nfunctions, random-generatability is conjectured not to hold, leaving no known\nidentification advantages in genuinely quantum regimes.\n  In this work, we give the first proofs of quantum identification learning\nadvantages under standard complexity assumptions. We confirm that quantum-hard\nfunctions are not random-generatable unless BQP is contained in the second\nlevel of the polynomial hierarchy, ruling out cryptographic-style data\ngeneration strategies. We then introduce a new approach: we show that\nverifiable identification - solving the identification task for valid datasets\nwhile rejecting invalid ones - is classically hard for quantum labeling\nfunctions unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we show that, for\na broad class of tasks, solving the identification problem implies verifiable\nidentification in the polynomial hierarchy.

    "abstract": "Long Gamma Ray Bursts (lGRBs) are associated with jets in Type Ic broadline\nsupernovae. The Collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the jet\nformation from the core collapse of a massive star in such supernovae. The GRB\ncan only be produced after a successful jet break out from the star. Under this\nformalism the GRB duration ($t_{\\rm{90}}$) has been hypothesized to be the\ndifference between the central engine activity duration ($t_{\\rm{eng}}$) and\nthe jet breakout time ($t_{\\rm{bo}}$), that is $t_{\\rm{90}} = t_{\\rm{eng}} -\nt_{\\rm{bo}}$. This disallows $t_{\\rm{90}} > t_{\\rm{eng}}$ and puts a lower\nbound on successful lGRB jet central engine duration ($t_{\\rm{eng}} >\nt_{\\rm{bo}}$), various numerical simulations have shown otherwise. This study\nconsiders a photospheric GRB emission from a relativistic jet punching out of a\nWolf-Rayet-like star. We use the bolometric lightcurve generated to calculate\nthe lGRB duration ($t_{\\rm{90}}$) for varying engine duration. We find for\nlonger engine duration the lGRB lightcurve reflects the jet profile and\n$t_{\\rm{90}} \\approx t_{\\rm{eng}}$. While for shorter engine duration, the\n$t_{\\rm{90}}$ has photospheric radius ($R_{\\rm{ph}}$) dependence. This can be\nmodeled by a relation, $t_{\\rm{90}} = t^{\\rm{90}}_{\\rm{eng}} +\n0.03\\left(\\frac{R_{\\rm{ph}}}{c}\\right)$, where c is the speed of light, with a\nlower bound on $t_{\\rm{90}}$ for a successful lGRB. This relation should be\nmost relevant for possible low-luminous lGRBs originating from a collapsar with\ncentral engine duration comparable to the jet breakout time.",

    "abstract": "Space plasmas in various astrophysical setups can often be both very hot and\ndilute, making them highly susceptible to waves and fluctuations, which are\ngenerally self-generated and maintained by kinetic instabilities. In this\nsense, we have in-situ observational evidence from the solar wind and planetary\nenvironments, which reveal not only wave fluctuations at kinetic scales of\nelectrons and protons, but also non-equilibrium distributions of particle\nvelocities. This paper reports on the progress made in achieving a consistent\nmodeling of the instabilities generated by temperature anisotropy, taking\nconcrete example of those induced by anisotropic electrons, such as,\nelectromagnetic electron-cyclotron (whistler) and firehose instabilities. The\neffects of the two main electron populations, the quasi-thermal core and the\nsuprathermal halo indicated by the observations, are thus captured. The\nlow-energy core is bi-Maxwellian, and the halo is described for the first time\nby a regularized (bi-)$\\kappa$-distribution (RKD), which was recently\nintroduced to fix inconsistencies of standard $\\kappa$-distributions (SKD). In\nthe absence of a analytical RKD dispersion kinetic formalism (involving tedious\nand laborious derivations), both the dispersion and (in)stability properties\nare directly solved numerically using the numerical Arbitrary Linear Plasma\nSolver (ALPS). The results have an increased degree of confidence, considering\nthe successful testing of the ALPS on previous results with established\ndistributions.",

The control framework\ndeveloped in this paper addresses these challenges by formulating the\ninspection task as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to\nmaximize information gained from the cameras, while navigating to the next best\nview, subject to illumination and FOV constraints.

To implement a two-photon threshold\ndetector, we utilize a dimer of resonators - two lumped-element resonators\ninteracting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively\ncoupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the\nexternal flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a non-perturbative\ntwo-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the\ncoherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in\nanother resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least\ntwo photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand\n\\textit{in situ} switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the\nmodified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate\nthat, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than $99\\%$\nfidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns.

Because these challenges span both computational and societal\ndomains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive\ntranslation with a well-founded framework.\n  This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset\ndesigned to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems\nfrom English to French. FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence\npairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the\nstereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator\nambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).\n  We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B,\nLlama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. Our results\nreveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting\npersistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation.\nThese findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions\naimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation\nsystems.\n  We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and\ndisclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.",

Using the\n3D dynamics of gas and interstellar polydisperse dust grains we analyze the\nevolution of SNR in the inhomogeneous medium. We obtain spatial distributions\nof the surface brigthness both of the X-ray emission from hot gas inside SNR\nand the IR emission from the SNR swept-up shell, as well as, the average gas\ntemperature in the SNR, $T_X$. We find that the IRX changes significantly (by a\nfactor of $\\sim 3-30$) as a function of impact distance within the SNR and its\nage. In a low inhomogeneous medium the IRX drops rapidly during the SNR\nevolution. On the other hand, if large inhomogeneities are present in the\nmedium, the IRX is maintained at higher levels during the late SNR evolution at\nradiative phase due to replenishment of dust in the hot gas by incompletely\ndestroyed fragments behind the shock front. We show that the onset of the\nradiative phase determines the evolution of the $T_X - {\\rm IRX}$ diagram. We\nillustrate that decreasing gas metallicity or density leads to high values of\ntemperature and IRX ratio.

The inverse\nmodeling component leverages the trained GNS, reverse-mode automatic\ndifferentiation, and L-BFGS-B optimization to infer material properties from a\ntarget runout geometry. Its performance is demonstrated by back-calculating the\nmaterial strengths that led to failure-induced runout in a dam system composed\nof multiple materials.

Implementing\nheterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample\nfurther provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge\nof topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of\nCVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges.

The LLM first generates samples online, which are then used to derive\nrewards for training. The conventional view holds that the colocated\narchitecture, where the two stages share resources via temporal multiplexing,\noutperforms the disaggregated architecture, in which dedicated resources are\nassigned to each stage. However, in real-world deployments, we observe that the\ncolocated architecture suffers from resource coupling, where the two stages are\nconstrained to use the same resources. This coupling compromises the\nscalability and cost-efficiency of colocated RL in large-scale training. In\ncontrast, the disaggregated architecture allows for flexible resource\nallocation, supports heterogeneous training setups, and facilitates\ncross-datacenter deployment.\n  StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully\nunlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in\nexisting disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage\ndependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length\ndistributions. To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional\nstage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and\nachieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL. To address skewness bubbles,\nStreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples\nand reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling.\nExperiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to\n1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.",

Medical vision-language models\n(med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process\nmultimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit\ntheir performance hinges on how well image and text representations are\naligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive\nlearning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of\nfine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to\nsuboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven\nTriplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through\nmultimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as\nadjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment\nmethods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured\nmeta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant\nintra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based\nentity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from\nCXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public\ndatasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a\nnovel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample\nsimilarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors.\nLastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit\nwithin- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology\ncharacteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance\nin downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art\nalignment methods.",

We showcase these developments in a\ncase study on the validation of a risk prediction model for deterioration of\nhospitalized COVID-19 patients. Compared to the conventional sample size\ncalculation methods, a Bayesian approach requires explicit quantification of\nuncertainty around model performance, and thereby enables flexible sample size\nrules based on expected precision, assurance probabilities, and VoI.

The\ndifficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to\ntrain a supervised classifier. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require\ntraining data and can potentially address this problem. This paper investigates\nthe performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial\ndataset. We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed\nto support requirements tracing. We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using\ndifferent embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number\nof parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large\nnumber of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama. Our ground truth includes 377\nrequirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces. For the evaluation, we adopt\ntraditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\\beta$, as well as a\nnovel label distance metric Dn. This aims to better capture the\nclassification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of\nhow far the results are from the ground truth. 1) The top-performing model on 5\nout of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04,\nwhile BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum\n$F_\\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04. 2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the\nbest classification results compared to LLMs. Thus, addressing the problem in\npractice is feasible as limited computing power is needed. 3) The model\narchitecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence)\nsignificantly affects the classifier's performance. We conclude that using ZSL\nfor multi-label requirements classification offers promising results.

Most existing video\nunderstanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet\nthey struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely\ndistributed and not pre-segmented. Moreover, long-form video understanding\noften relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive\nannotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency. With ViSMaP we\nbridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and\nlong ones (where it's not). We rely on LLMs to create optimised\npseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.\nThese pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates\nlong-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long\nvideos. Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively\ngenerate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy\nleverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model\nto guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one\nto generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it,\nand a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is\nnecessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on\nthe generator prompt, and varies widely among videos. We evaluate our summaries\nextensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves\nperformance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while\ngeneralising across domains without sacrificing performance.

To\nfurther reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution\nScore (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order\nneighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In\naddition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable\nfeatures, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors.

    "abstract": "In Android GUI testing, generating an action sequence for a task that can be\nreplayed as a test script is common. Generating sequences of actions and\nrespective test scripts from task goals described in natural language can\neliminate the need for manually writing test scripts. However, existing\napproaches based on large language models (LLM) often struggle with identifying\nthe final action, and either end prematurely or continue past the final screen.\nIn this paper, we introduce VisiDroid, a multi-modal, LLM-based, multi-agent\nframework that iteratively determines the next action and leverages visual\nimages of screens to detect the task's completeness. The multi-modal approach\nenhances our model in two significant ways. First, this approach enables it to\navoid prematurely terminating a task when textual content alone provides\nmisleading indications of task completion. Additionally, visual input helps the\ntool avoid errors when changes in the GUI do not directly affect functionality\ntoward task completion, such as adjustments to font sizes or colors. Second,\nthe multi-modal approach also ensures the tool not progress beyond the final\nscreen, which might lack explicit textual indicators of task completion but\ncould display a visual element indicating task completion, which is common in\nGUI apps. Our evaluation shows that VisiDroid achieves an accuracy of 87.3%,\noutperforming the best baseline relatively by 23.5%. We also demonstrate that\nour multi-modal framework with images and texts enables the LLM to better\ndetermine when a task is completed.",

    "abstract": "(Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of\nhyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close\nto Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy\ndistributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of\nmagnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the\nUV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered\nlight from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission\nin the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging\npolarization observations in the $R_{\\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2\ninstrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to\nconstrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a\nspatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\\pm 0.7$%, confirming the\nscattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is\nspatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization\nfraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source\nfound in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN\nsublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\\lesssim 50~\\rm deg$ viewed at an\ninclination $\\gtrsim 45~\\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization\nfraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow\nvelocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows\nthrough spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the\noutflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host\ngalaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to\nstudy dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those\nobtained through traditional spectroscopic studies.",

    "abstract": "We present radial density profiles, as traced by luminous galaxies and dark\nmatter particles, for voids in eleven snapshots of the \\texttt{TNG300}\nsimulation. The snapshots span 11.65~Gyr of cosmic time, corresponding to the\nredshift range $0 \\le z \\le 3$. Using the comoving galaxy fields, voids were\nidentified via a well-tested, watershed transformation-based algorithm. Voids\nwere defined to be underdense regions that are unlikely to have arisen from\nPoisson noise, resulting in the selection of $\\sim100-200$ of the largest\nunderdense regions in each snapshot. At all redshifts, the radial density\nprofiles as traced by both the galaxies and the dark matter resemble inverse\ntop-hat functions. However, details of the functions (particularly the\nunderdensities of the innermost regions and the overdensities of the ridges)\nevolve considerably more for the dark matter density profiles than for the\ngalaxy density profiles. At all redshifts, a linear relationship between the\ngalaxy and dark matter density profiles exists, and the slope of the\nrelationship is similar to the bias estimates for \\texttt{TNG300} snapshots.\nLastly, we identify distinct environments in which voids can exist, defining\n``void-in-void\" and ``void-in-cloud\" populations (i.e., voids that reside in\nlarger underdense or overdense regions, respectively) and we investigate ways\nin which the relative densities of dark matter and galaxies in the interiors\nand ridges of these structures vary as a function of void environment.",

To tackle these problems, we\nregard the matrix-vector operations in the standard attention mechanism on\nvectors in Euclidean space as bilinear forms and linear operators in vector\nspaces and generalize the attention mechanism to function spaces. This new\nattention mechanism is fully equivalent to the standard attention but\nimpossible to compute due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces. To\naddress this, inspired by model reduction techniques, we propose a Subspace\nParameterized Attention (SUPRA) neural operator, which approximates the\nattention mechanism within a finite-dimensional subspace. To construct a\nsubspace on irregular domains for SUPRA, we propose using the Laplacian\neigenfunctions, which naturally adapt to domains' geometry and guarantee the\noptimal approximation for smooth functions.

Steady\nvelocity fields that maximise heat transfer have previously been calculated for\nheated pipe flow, but were calculated independently of buoyancy forces, and\nhence independently of the flow regime and time-dependent dynamics of the flow.\nIn this work, a variational method is applied to find an optimal body force of\nlimited magnitude that maximises heat transfer for the vertical arrangement,\nwith the velocity field constrained by the full governing equations. In our\ncalculations, mostly at Re=3000, it is found that streamwise-independent rolls\nremain optimal, as in previous steady optimisations, but that the optimal\nnumber of rolls and their radial position are dependent on the flow regime.\nSurprisingly, while it is generally assumed that turbulence enhances heat\ntransfer, for the strongly forced case, time-dependence typically leads to a\nreduction.

Experiments on the nuScenes-OpenOccupancy\nbenchmark show that MS-Occ achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 32.1%\nand a mean IoU (mIoU) of 25.3%, surpassing the state-of-the-art by +0.7% IoU\nand +2.4% mIoU. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each\nmodule, with substantial improvements in small-object perception, demonstrating\nthe practical value of MS-Occ for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Rapid compression machines (RCMs) have been extensively used to quantify fuel\nautoignition chemistry and validate chemical kinetic models. Historically, the\nanalyses of experimental and modeling RCM autoignition data have been conducted\nbased on the adiabatic core hypothesis where real-fluid behavior has been\ncompletely overlooked, though this might be significant at common RCM test\nconditions. This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two\nsignificant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental\ncombustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation\nand analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs\naffect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models?\nTo this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and\nderived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an\neffective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for\nRCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM\ntests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM\nautoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression\ntemperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber.\nFurthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can\nbe introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming\nideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical\nkinetic models. Therefore, we recommend the community adopt frameworks with\nreal-fluid behavior fully accounted for to analyze and simulate past and future\nRCM experiments, so as to avoid misinterpretation of RCM autoignition\nexperiments and eliminate the errors that can be introduced into the simulation\nresults with the existing RCM modeling frameworks.",

    "abstract": "As robots become increasingly involved in decision-making processes (e.g.,\npersonnel selection), concerns about fairness and social inclusion arise. This\nstudy examines social exclusion in robot-led group interviews by robot Ameca,\nexploring the relationship between objective exclusion (robot's attention\nallocation), subjective exclusion (perceived exclusion), mood change, and need\nfulfillment. In a controlled lab study (N = 35), higher objective exclusion\nsignificantly predicted subjective exclusion. In turn, subjective exclusion\nnegatively impacted mood and need fulfillment but only mediated the\nrelationship between objective exclusion and need fulfillment. A piecewise\nregression analysis identified a critical threshold at which objective\nexclusion begins to be perceived as subjective exclusion. Additionally, the\nstanding position was the primary predictor of exclusion, whereas demographic\nfactors (e.g., gender, height) had no significant effect. These findings\nunderscore the need to consider both objective and subjective exclusion in\nhuman-robot interactions and have implications for fairness in robot-assisted\nhiring processes.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a serious ocular complication that poses a\nsignificant threat to patients' vision and overall health. Early detection and\naccurate grading are essential to prevent vision loss. Current automatic\ngrading methods rely heavily on deep learning applied to retinal fundus images,\nbut the complex, irregular patterns of lesions in these images, which vary in\nshape and distribution, make it difficult to capture subtle changes. This study\nintroduces RadFuse, a multi-representation deep learning framework that\nintegrates non-linear RadEx-transformed sinogram images with traditional fundus\nimages to enhance diabetic retinopathy detection and grading. Our RadEx\ntransformation, an optimized non-linear extension of the Radon transform,\ngenerates sinogram representations to capture complex retinal lesion patterns.\nBy leveraging both spatial and transformed domain information, RadFuse enriches\nthe feature set available to deep learning models, improving the\ndifferentiation of severity levels. We conducted extensive experiments on two\nbenchmark datasets, APTOS-2019 and DDR, using three convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs): ResNeXt-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG19. RadFuse showed significant\nimprovements over fundus-image-only models across all three CNN architectures\nand outperformed state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. For severity\ngrading across five stages, RadFuse achieved a quadratic weighted kappa of\n93.24%, an accuracy of 87.07%, and an F1-score of 87.17%. In binary\nclassification between healthy and diabetic retinopathy cases, the method\nreached an accuracy of 99.09%, precision of 98.58%, and recall of 99.6%,\nsurpassing previously established models. These results demonstrate RadFuse's\ncapacity to capture complex non-linear features, advancing diabetic retinopathy\nclassification and promoting the integration of advanced mathematical\ntransforms in medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "In view of the negative results from various dark matter detection\nexperiments, we had earlier proposed an alternate theoretical framework through\nModification of Newtonian Gravity (MONG). Here, the Poison's equation is\nmodified by introducing an additional gravitational self-energy density term\nalong with the usual dark energy density term. In this work we extend this\nmodel to account for the presence of low-density gas at high temperatures (10^8\nK) in the intra cluster medium (ICM) by estimating the velocities to which\nparticles will be subjected by the modified gravitational force. Considering\nthat the ICM is under the influence of the cluster's gravity, particle\nvelocities of the ions in the ICM must be balanced by the cluster's\ngravitational force. The particle velocities obtained for various clusters from\ntheir temperature profiles match the velocity produced by the MONG\ngravitational force. Thus, the increase in the gravitational potential at the\noutskirts of galaxies balances the thermal pressure of the ICM, maintaining\nhydrostatic equilibrium without invoking DM. The effect of MONG on the angular\nmomentum of galaxies is also studied by obtaining a scaling relation between\nthe angular momentum and the mass of a galaxy. MONG predicts a higher\ndependence on mass in comparison to the \\Lambda-CDM model. This increased\ndependence on mass compensates for the halo contribution to the angular\nmomentum. The angular momentum from MONG for galaxies from the SPARC database\nis compared to the halo angular momentum by a Chi-square fit technique. The\ncorrelation coefficient is found to be unity, showing a replicable result.",

Identifying\ndefects in glasses, which are inherently disordered, is a long-standing problem\nthat was approached in several ways. We examine candidates for defects in\nglasses that represent areas of strong sound damping. We show that some defects\nare associated with quasi-localized excitations, which may be associated with\nmodes in excess of the Debye theory. We also examine generalized Debye\nrelations, which relate sound damping and the speed of sound to excess modes.\nWe derive a generalized Debye relation that does not resort to an approximation\nused by previous authors. We find that our relation and the relation given by\nprevious authors are almost identical at small frequencies and also reproduce\nthe independently determined density of states. However, the different\ngeneralized Debye relations do not agree around the boson peak.

With the advent of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS), a vast repository of stellar LCs has become available, offering\nunprecedented opportunities for discovering new EBs. To efficiently identify\nsuch systems, we propose a novel method that combines LC data and generalized\nLomb-Scargle periodograms (GLS) data to classify EBs.

We collected 4,225 EB samples, utilizing their 2-minute cadence\nLCs for model training and validation. CALNet achieved a recall rate of 99.1%,\ndemonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Applying it to TESS 2-minute\nLCs from Sectors 1 to 74, we identified 9,351 new EBs after manual visual\ninspection, significantly expanding the known sample size.

These\ninclude: (1) the lack of clarity around what AI for education truly means --\noften ignoring the distinct purposes, strengths, and limitations of different\nAI families -- and the trend of equating it with domain-agnostic,\ncompany-driven large language models; (2) the widespread neglect of essential\nlearning processes such as motivation, emotion, and (meta)cognition in\nAI-driven learner modelling and their contextual nature; (3) limited\nintegration of domain knowledge and lack of stakeholder involvement in AI\ndesign and development; (4) continued use of non-sequential machine learning\nmodels on temporal educational data; (5) misuse of non-sequential metrics to\nevaluate sequential models; (6) use of unreliable explainable AI methods to\nprovide explanations for black-box models; (7) ignoring ethical guidelines in\naddressing data inconsistencies during model training; (8) use of mainstream AI\nmethods for pattern discovery and learning analytics without systematic\nbenchmarking; and (9) overemphasis on global prescriptions while overlooking\nlocalised, student-specific recommendations.

This allows us to test the\nquality of improvement of the FP action, without introducing additional\nartifacts. We find that discretization effects in gradient-flow observables are\nhighly suppressed and less than 1% up to lattice spacings of 0.14 fm, allowing\ncontinuum physics to be extracted from coarse lattices. The quality of\nimprovement achieved motivates the use of the FP action in future gauge theory\nstudies. The advantages of ML-based parameterizations also highlight the\npossibility of realizing quantum perfect actions in lattice gauge theory.",

    "abstract": "An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for\nenhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the\nnetworks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in\ndense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial\ncovert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous\ntransmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to\nimprove the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness.\nSpecifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP)\nunder the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information\n(CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert\ncommunication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair\nchannel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert\nconstraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the\nAASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional\nstate-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic\nenvironments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG)\nalgorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to\nsolve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized\nas the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration\nprocess by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of\ndenoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to\naccomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better\nstate-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.",

We study the geometry of these varieties\nwhen $x$ is regular semisimple.\n  In the first part, we establish that they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, of pure\nexpected dimension and have rational singularities. We then show that the\ncohomology of ample line bundles vanishes in positive degrees, in arbitrary\ncharacteristic. This extends to nef line bundles when the base field has\ncharacteristic zero or sufficiently large characteristic. Along the way, we\nprove that Lusztig varieties are Frobenius split in positive characteristic and\nthat their open cells are affine. We also prove that the open cells in\nDeligne-Lusztig varieties are affine, settling a question that has been open\nsince the foundational paper of Deligne and Lusztig.\n  In the second part, we explore their relationship with regular semisimple\nHessenberg varieties. Both varieties admit Tymoczko's dot action of $W$ on\ntheir (intersection) cohomology. We associate to each element $w$ in $W$ a\nHessenberg space using the tangent cone of the Schubert variety associated with\n$w$, and show that the cohomology of the associated regular semisimple Lusztig\nvarieties and Hessenberg varieties is isomorphic as graded $W$-representations\nwhen they are smooth.\n  This relationship extends to the level of varieties: we construct a flat\ndegeneration of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties to regular semisimple\nHessenberg varieties.

However, adapting DL models to medical tasks remains a significant\nchallenge, primarily due to two key factors: (1) architecture selection, as\ndifferent tasks necessitate specialized model designs, and (2) weight\ninitialization, which directly impacts the convergence speed and final\nperformance of the models. Although transfer learning from ImageNet is a widely\nadopted strategy, its effectiveness is constrained by the substantial\ndifferences between natural and medical images. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Medical Neural Network Search (MedNNS), the first Neural Network\nSearch framework for medical imaging applications. MedNNS jointly optimizes\narchitecture selection and weight initialization by constructing a meta-space\nthat encodes datasets and models based on how well they perform together. We\nbuild this space using a Supernetwork-based approach, expanding the model zoo\nsize by 51x times over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, we\nintroduce rank loss and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) loss into the\nconstruction of the space to capture inter-model and inter-dataset\nrelationships, thereby achieving more accurate alignment in the meta-space.\nExperimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that MedNNS\nsignificantly outperforms both ImageNet pre-trained DL models and SOTA Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of\n1.7% across datasets while converging substantially faster.

We propose a\nscalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with\nevent cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is\nencoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of\nrays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our\nneural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions\nand a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction.\nLocal processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures\nconstant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera\nresolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets)\ndemonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our\nmethod achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when\napplied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA)\napproaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method\nalso allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still\nyielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%.

Additionally, investigation into the\nbehaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these\nperovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and\nresults are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results\nfrom these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites -\nthe undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2\nsurface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by\nthe phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO\nsurface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies\nat the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich\nconditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2\nsurface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form,\nthe BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more\nsuitable for use in potential applications.

While traditional\nreplication-based methods have been used for failure-resilient model serving in\nthe cloud, such methods are often infeasible in edge environments due to\nsignificant resource constraints that preclude full replication. To address\nthis problem, this paper presents FailLite, a failure-resilient model serving\nsystem that employs (i) a heterogeneous replication where failover models are\nsmaller variants of the original model, (ii) an intelligent approach that uses\nwarm replicas to ensure quick failover for critical applications while using\ncold replicas, and (iii) progressive failover to provide low mean time to\nrecovery (MTTR) for the remaining applications. We implement a full prototype\nof our system and demonstrate its efficacy on an experimental edge testbed. Our\nresults using 27 models show that FailLite can recover all failed applications\nwith 175.5ms MTTR and only a 0.6% reduction in accuracy.",

The\nexisting representative approaches generally follow the research pipeline which\nmainly consists of three core procedures, including independent feature\nextraction for visual and linguistic modalities, respectively, cross-modal\ninteraction module, and independent prediction heads for different sub-tasks.\nAlbeit achieving remarkable performance, this research line has two\nlimitations: 1) The linguistic content has not been fully injected into the\nentire visual backbone for boosting more effective visual feature extraction\nand it needs an extra cross-modal interaction module; 2) The relationship\nbetween REC and RES tasks is not effectively exploited to help the\ncollaborative prediction for more accurate output. To deal with these problems,\nin this paper, we propose a Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning\nframework for multi-task visual grounding, called PLVL, which not only finely\nmine the inherent feature expression of the visual modality itself but also\nprogressively inject the language information to help learn linguistic-related\nvisual features. In this manner, our PLVL does not need additional cross-modal\nfusion module while fully introducing the language guidance. Furthermore, we\nanalyze that the localization center for REC would help identify the\nto-be-segmented object region for RES to some extent. Inspired by this\ninvestigation, we design a multi-task head to accomplish collaborative\npredictions for these two sub-tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on several\nbenchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that our PLVL obviously\noutperforms the representative methods in both REC and RES tasks.\nhttps://github.com/jcwang0602/PLVL",

For a\ngenerated solution trajectory $y(t)$, we show small $o$ convergence rates\ndependent on $b(t)$ for $f(y(t)) - \\min f$, and the weak convergence of $y(t)$\ntowards a global minimizer of $f$.

As the first key point of this paper, we show\nthat for a special choice for $b(t)$, these two seemingly unrelated dynamical\nsystems are connected: namely, they are time reparametrizations of each other.\nEvery statement regarding the continuous-time accelerated gradient system may\nbe recovered from its Heavy Ball counterpart.\n  As the second key point of this paper, we observe that this connection\nextends beyond the optimization setting. Attached to the monotone equation\ninvolving the operator $V$, we again consider a Heavy Ball-like system which\nfeatures an additional correction term which is the time derivative of the\noperator along the trajectory. We establish a time reparametrization\nequivalence with the Fast OGDA dynamics introduced by Bot, Csetnek and Nguyen\nin 2022, which can be seen as an analog of the continuous accelerated gradient\ndynamics, but for monotone operators.

Since\nworkers are typically unwilling to provide training services/models freely and\nvoluntarily, many incentive mechanisms in FL are designed to incentivize\nparticipation by offering monetary rewards from requesters. However, existing\nstudies neglect two crucial aspects of real-world FL scenarios. First, workers\ncan possess inherent incompatibility characteristics (e.g., communication\nchannels and data sources), which can lead to degradation of FL efficiency\n(e.g., low communication efficiency and poor model generalization). Second, the\nrequesters are budgeted, which limits the amount of workers they can hire for\ntheir tasks. In this paper, we investigate the scenario in FL where multiple\nbudgeted requesters seek training services from incompatible workers with\nprivate training costs. We consider two settings: the cooperative budget\nsetting where requesters cooperate to pool their budgets to improve their\noverall utility and the non-cooperative budget setting where each requester\noptimizes their utility within their own budgets. To address efficiency\ndegradation caused by worker incompatibility, we develop novel\ncompatibility-aware incentive mechanisms, CARE-CO and CARE-NO, for both\nsettings to elicit true private costs and determine workers to hire for\nrequesters and their rewards while satisfying requester budget constraints. Our\nmechanisms guarantee individual rationality, truthfulness, budget feasibility,\nand approximation performance.

    "abstract": "This study integrates radiative equilibrium boundary conditions on a\ncatalytic surface within the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The\nradiative equilibrium boundary condition is based on the principle of energy\nconservation at each surface element, enabling the accurate capture of\nspatially varying surface temperatures and heat fluxes encountered during\natmospheric re-entry. The surface catalycity is represented through the\nfinite-rate surface chemistry (FRSC) model, specifically focusing on the\nheterogeneous recombination of atomic oxygen on silica surfaces. Both the FRSC\nmodel and the radiative equilibrium boundary conditions within the DSMC\nframework are validated through comparison to analytical solutions. Numerical\nsimulations are conducted for rarefied hypersonic flow around a two-dimensional\ncylinder under representative re-entry conditions for both non-catalytic and\ncatalytic surfaces. The results demonstrate significant discrepancies in\ncomputed surface properties between the radiative equilibrium and conventional\nisothermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, linear interpolation between\nresults from two independent isothermal boundary conditions is shown to be\ninadequate for accurately predicting surface heat flux, particularly when\nsurface reactions are considered. The observed discrepancies originate from a\nnon-linear correlation between surface temperature and heat flux, influenced by\nfactors such as surface catalycity and local geometric variations along the\ncylinder. These findings highlight the necessity of implementing radiative\nequilibrium boundary conditions within DSMC to ensure physically accurate\naerothermodynamic computations.",

While DVR has been extensively used\nin classical simulations, its quantum implementation, particularly using\nGaussian quadrature grids, remains underexplored. We develop a quantum circuit\nthat efficiently transforms FBR into DVR by following a recursive construction\nbased on quantum arithmetic operations, and we compare this approach with\nmethods that directly load DVR matrix elements using quantum read-only memory\n(QROM).

    "abstract": "The generation of high-quality, animatable 3D head avatars from text has\nenormous potential in content creation applications such as games, movies, and\nembodied virtual assistants. Current text-to-3D generation methods typically\ncombine parametric head models with 2D diffusion models using score\ndistillation sampling to produce 3D-consistent results. However, they struggle\nto synthesize realistic details and suffer from misalignments between the\nappearance and the driving parametric model, resulting in unnatural animation\nresults. We discovered that these limitations stem from ambiguities in the 2D\ndiffusion predictions during 3D avatar distillation, specifically: i) the\navatar's appearance and geometry is underconstrained by the text input, and ii)\nthe semantic alignment between the predictions and the parametric head model is\ninsufficient because the diffusion model alone cannot incorporate information\nfrom the parametric model. In this work, we propose a novel framework,\nAnimPortrait3D, for text-based realistic animatable 3DGS avatar generation with\nmorphable model alignment, and introduce two key strategies to address these\nchallenges. First, we tackle appearance and geometry ambiguities by utilizing\nprior information from a pretrained text-to-3D model to initialize a 3D avatar\nwith robust appearance, geometry, and rigging relationships to the morphable\nmodel. Second, we refine the initial 3D avatar for dynamic expressions using a\nControlNet that is conditioned on semantic and normal maps of the morphable\nmodel to ensure accurate alignment. As a result, our method outperforms\nexisting approaches in terms of synthesis quality, alignment, and animation\nfidelity. Our experiments show that the proposed method advances the state of\nthe art in text-based, animatable 3D head avatar generation.",

Unlike other\nmethods, the synthesized CBF can account for changes and time-variations in the\nconstraints even when constructed for time-invariant constraints. This avoids\nrecomputing the CBF when the constraint specifications change. The method\nprovides an explicit characterization of the extended class K function {\\alpha}\nthat determines the dynamic properties of the CBF, and {\\alpha} can even be\nexplicitly chosen as a design parameter in the controller synthesis. The\nresulting CBF further accounts for input constraints, and its values can be\ndetermined at any point without having to compute the CBF over the entire\ndomain. The synthesis method is based on a finite horizon optimal control\nproblem inspired by Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and does not rely on\na nominal control law. The synthesized CBF is time-invariant if the constraints\nare. The method poses mild assumptions on the controllability of the dynamic\nsystem and assumes the knowledge of at least a subset of some control invariant\nset.

However, discretization errors\nin numerical modeling and incomplete seismic data acquisition can introduce\nnoise, which propagates through the adjoint operator and affects the accuracy\nof the velocity gradient, thereby impacting the FWI inversion accuracy. To\nmitigate the influence of noise on the gradient, we employ a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to refine the velocity model before performing the forward\nsimulation, aiming to reduce noise and provide a more accurate velocity update\ndirection. We use the same data misfit loss to update both the velocity and\nnetwork parameters, thereby forming a self-supervised learning procedure. We\npropose two implementation schemes, which differ in whether the velocity update\npasses through the CNN. In both methodologies, the velocity representation is\nextended (VRE) by using a neural network in addition to the grid-based\nvelocities. Thus, we refer to this general approach as VRE-FWI. Synthetic and\nreal data tests demonstrate that the proposed VRE-FWI achieves higher velocity\ninversion accuracy compared to traditional FWI, at a marginal additional\ncomputational cost of approximately 1%.",

An experimental camera-scintillation sheet\ncombination, was used to investigate the spatial dose distribution of a\nconverted UHDR Varian Trilogy. The dosimetric system was characterized by\nvariation of the number of pulses and source to surface distance (SSD) and its\napplication was investigated by variation of bolus thickness and ambient light\nintensity. The challenges of prelcinical real time 2D dosimetry with\nscintillating coatings were assessed by ex vivo irradiations of a rat brain,\nmouse hindlimb and whole body mouse. Radiochromic EBT XD film was used as\npassive reference dosimeter. The coating showed a linear response with the\nnumber of pulses in the absence and presence of transparent bolus, up to 3 cm\nthick, and with the inverse squared SSD. The presence of ambient light reduces\nthe signal-background ratio. The sheet showed to have sufficient flexibility to\nbe molded on the subjects' surface, following its curvatures. Linearity with\nnumber of pulses was preserved in a preclinical setting. For small field sizes\nthe light output became too low, resulting in noisy dose maps. The system\nshowed robust within 5% for camera set up differences. Calibration of the\nsystem was complicated due to set up variations and the inhomogeneity of the\nbeam. We showed the need for 2D real-time dosimetry to determine beam\ncharacteristics in non-homogeneous UHDR beams using a preclinical setting.

Extensive experiments\nconfirm the efficacy of our algorithms and theoretical results.",

The instrument is designed to operate\nexclusively with polarized neutrons and is specialized in longitudinal\npolarization analysis using Helmholtz coils and spherical zero-field neutron\npolarimetry using a Cryopad device. The advanced guide system polarizes and\nfocuses flexibly in the scattering plane. A first, fixed parabolic focusing\npart contains a series of three polarizing supermirror V-cavities that produce\na highly polarized beam. By exchanging straight and parabolic front-end guide\nsections, the resolution of the instrument can be optimized to meet\nexperimental requirements. Large, double-focusing monochromator and analyzer\nunits with pyrolytic graphite crystals enable efficient and adaptive energy\nselection, and a compact supermirror cavity analyzes the final neutron\npolarization. Alternatively, or in combination with this cavity, a Heusler\npolarization analyzer can be used. KOMPASS offers full- and half-polarized\nconfigurations with or without secondary energy analysis and provides a wide\nrange of polarization options. Therefore, KOMPASS is well suited for various\nstudies of static and dynamic magnetic correlations with energy transfers on\nthe neutron energy loss side up to ~12 meV.",

HIV self-testing offers a means to overcome barriers\nassociated with routine laboratory-based testing but carries a risk of\nincreasing incidence if replacement effects reduce overall test sensitivity.\nMethods: A linearized four-compartment HIV transmission model was applied to 38\nEnding the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdictions. A threshold testing level\nwas defined to counterbalance potential negative effects from reduced self-test\nsensitivity. Both the percentage of self-tests and the overall testing rate\nwere varied to quantify 10-year changes in HIV incidence. Results: Substantial\nheterogeneity emerged across districts. Incidence reductions exceeded 5 percent\nin some areas, while others saw only minor effects. Jurisdictions with higher\nbaseline testing displayed an elevated risk of increased incidence from\nsubstitution of laboratory-based testing with self-tests. In contrast, a\nderived Awareness Reproduction Number, capturing transmissions attributable to\nundiagnosed infection, strongly correlated with the magnitude of possible\nincidence declines. Conclusions: Local epidemiological context is pivotal in\ndetermining the risks and benefits of HIV self-testing. Jurisdictions with\nrobust testing systems may face a greater likelihood of inadvertently raising\nincidence, whereas those with a high number of individuals stand to achieve\nnotable transmission reductions.

While considerable\nliterature studies how humans trust AI agents, it is much less understood how\nLLM-based agents develop effective trust in humans. LLM-based agents likely\nrely on some sort of implicit effective trust in trust-related contexts (e.g.,\nevaluating individual loan applications) to assist and affect decision making.\nUsing established behavioral theories, we develop an approach that studies\nwhether LLMs trust depends on the three major trustworthiness dimensions:\ncompetence, benevolence and integrity of the human subject. We also study how\ndemographic variables affect effective trust. Across 43,200 simulated\nexperiments, for five popular language models, across five different scenarios\nwe find that LLM trust development shows an overall similarity to human trust\ndevelopment. We find that in most, but not all cases, LLM trust is strongly\npredicted by trustworthiness, and in some cases also biased by age, religion\nand gender, especially in financial scenarios. This is particularly true for\nscenarios common in the literature and for newer models. While the overall\npatterns align with human-like mechanisms of effective trust formation,\ndifferent models exhibit variation in how they estimate trust; in some cases,\ntrustworthiness and demographic factors are weak predictors of effective trust.\nThese findings call for a better understanding of AI-to-human trust dynamics\nand monitoring of biases and trust development patterns to prevent unintended\nand potentially harmful outcomes in trust-sensitive applications of AI.",

    "abstract": "Object classification models utilizing point cloud data are fundamental for\n3D media understanding, yet they often struggle with unseen or\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Existing point cloud unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) methods typically employ a multi-task learning (MTL) framework\nthat combines primary classification tasks with auxiliary self-supervision\ntasks to bridge the gap between cross-domain feature distributions. However,\nour further experiments demonstrate that not all gradients from\nself-supervision tasks are beneficial and some may negatively impact the\nclassification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, termed\nSaliency Map-based Data Sampling Block (SM-DSB), to mitigate these gradient\nconflicts. Specifically, our method designs a new scoring mechanism based on\nthe skewness of 3D saliency maps to estimate gradient conflicts without\nrequiring target labels. Leveraging this, we develop a sample selection\nstrategy that dynamically filters out samples whose self-supervision gradients\nare not beneficial for the classification. Our approach is scalable,\nintroducing modest computational overhead, and can be integrated into all the\npoint cloud UDA MTL frameworks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we provide a new\nperspective on understanding the UDA problem through back-propagation analysis.",

Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on\nthe fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future\nsteps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model. While the LLM\nagent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of\nits planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned\nworld model.

    "abstract": "A diverse range of interpolation methods, including Kriging, spline/minimum\ncurvature and radial basis function interpolation exist for interpolating\nspatially incomplete geoscientific data. Such methods use various spatial\nproperties of the observed data to infer its local and global behaviour. In\nthis study, we exploit the adaptability of locally interacting systems from\nstatistical physics and develop an interpolation framework for numerical\ngeoscientific data called Interacting Immediate Neighbour Interpolation (IINI),\nwhich solely relies on local and immediate neighbour correlations. In the IINI\nmethod, medium-to-long range correlations are constructed from the collective\nlocal interactions of grid centroids. To demonstrate the functionality and\nstrengths of IINI, we apply our methodology to the interpolation of ground\ngravity, airborne magnetic and airborne radiometric datasets. We further\ncompare the performance of IINI to conventional methods such as minimum\ncurvature surface fitting. Results show that IINI is competitive with\nconventional interpolation techniques in terms of validation accuracy, while\nbeing significantly simpler in terms of algorithmic complexity and data\npre-processing requirements. IINI demonstrates the broader applicability of\nstatistical physics concepts within the field of geostatistics, highlighting\ntheir potential to enrich and expand traditional geostatistical methods.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) demands verifiable logical\ncoherence and multimodal reasoning capabilities. While large language models\n(LLMs) have shown rapid progress in GPS, their advancement is hindered by the\nlack of reliable benchmarks and systematic methodologies. A critical challenge\nis the inherent hallucination in LLMs, which leads to synthetic GPS datasets\nthat are often noisy, unverified, and self-contradictory. To address this, we\nintroduce TrustGeoGen, a data engine that generates formally verified geometric\nproblems to establish a principled and trustworthy benchmark. Our engine\nintegrates four key innovations: 1) Multimodal Alignment, which synchronizes\nthe generation of diagrams, text, and step-by-step solutions; 2) Formal\nVerification, ensuring all reasoning paths are rule-compliant; 3) Connection\nThinking, bridging formal deduction with human-like logical steps; and 4) our\n\\textit{GeoExplore} series algorithms, which produce diverse problem variants\nwith multiple solutions and self-reflective backtracking. Using this engine, we\ncreate the GeoTrust-200K dataset and the corresponding GeoTrust-test benchmark,\nboth with guaranteed cross-modal integrity. Experiments reveal that\nstate-of-the-art models achieve only 45.83\\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test,\nhighlighting its significant challenge. Furthermore, training on our\nsynthesized data substantially improves model performance on GPS tasks, with\nstrong generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Self-aggregation of tropical convection is a universal feature observed in a\ndiverse range of atmospheric environments. Several preceding models\nconceptualized the self-aggregation of convection as a phase transition driven\nby collisions between cold pool gust fronts. However, self-aggregation may also\nbe influenced by various physical processes, such as surface fluxes, radiation,\nand moisture perturbations in the planetary boundary layer, and it remains\nunclear which process plays a dominant role. In this study, we develop a simple\nstochastic lattice model for the pattern formation of deep convection, inspired\nby the two-dimensional Ising model. Here, in addition to the process of cold\npool collisions, which have an effect of triggering new convection, we\nincorporate the process of clear-sky radiative cooling that has an effect of\nsuppressing deep convection as an interaction between clouds. Our results show\nthat by amplifying the intensity of the clear-sky radiative cooling effect, the\ntransition from a quasi-uniform to an inhomogeneous cloud field can be\nreproduced. The model also successfully explains the dependence of\nself-aggregation on several model parameters, such as the experimental domain\nsize and the characteristic size of cold pools. Furthermore, by varying the\ndistance over which the subsidence induced by radiative cooling extends, we\nsucceed in capturing a pattern formation that closely resembles the convective\nclusters observed in the real atmosphere and three-dimensional numerical model\nsimulations.",

This minimalist approach produces models that achieve\nreasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA\nRL reasoning models built upon the same base model.

The Motion Transformer (MTR)\narchitecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common\nbenchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs\npre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory\nprediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to\nmisalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in\nunfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation\nby integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This\nadaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion\nDataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points\nhas a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially\nfor predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on\nground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are\nillegal maneuvers.",

To study the structure of TOI-2109b's atmosphere, we obtained\nhigh-resolution emission spectra of both the planetary day- and nightsides with\nCARMENES and CRIRES$^+$. By applying the cross-correlation technique, we\nidentified the emission signatures of Fe I and CO, as well as a thermal\ninversion layer in the dayside atmosphere; no significant H$_2$O signal was\ndetected from the dayside. None of the analyzed species were detectable from\nthe nightside atmosphere. We applied a Bayesian retrieval framework that\ncombines high-resolution spectroscopy with photometric measurements to\nconstrain the dayside atmospheric parameters and derive upper limits for the\nnightside hemisphere. The dayside thermal inversion extends from 3200 K to 4600\nK, with an atmospheric metallicity consistent with that of the host star (0.36\ndex). Only weak constraints could be placed on the C/O ratio ($>$ 0.15). The\nretrieved spectral line broadening is consistent with tidally locked rotation,\nindicating the absence of strong dynamical processes. An upper temperature\nlimit of 2400 K and a maximum atmospheric temperature gradient of 700 K/log bar\ncould be derived for the nightside. Comparison of the retrieved dayside T-p\nprofile with theoretical models, the absence of strong atmospheric dynamics,\nand significant differences in the thermal constraints between the day- and\nnightside hemispheres suggest a limited heat transport efficiency across the\nplanetary atmosphere.

When the observer's view of the domain\nchanges, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and\nthe projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of\nsight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization.\nTherefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's\nmajor axis orientation and magnetic field direction.

We introduce a hybrid proximal gradient and negative curvature method,\nas well as a proximal Newton-CG method, to find a strong* approximate\nsecond-order stationary point and a weak approximate second-order stationary\npoint for \\(\\ell_1\\)-regularized optimization problems, respectively.\nComprehensive analyses are provided regarding the iteration complexity,\ncomputational complexity, and the local superlinear convergence rates of the\nfirst phases of these two methods under specific error bound conditions.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that the proximal Newton-CG method achieves the\nbest-known iteration complexity for attaining the proposed weak approximate\nsecond-order stationary point, which is consistent with the results for finding\nan approximate second-order stationary point in unconstrained optimization.\nThrough a toy example, we show that our proposed methods can effectively escape\nthe first-order approximate solution. Numerical experiments implemented on the\n\\(\\ell_1\\)-regularized Student's t-regression problem validate the\neffectiveness of both methods.",

    "abstract": "In human-computer interaction, head pose estimation profoundly influences\napplication functionality. Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for\nthis purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over\nsimplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in\ncompute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Grouped\nAttention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set\nframework. By grouping landmarks into regions and employing small Deep Set\nlayers, we reduce computational complexity. Our multihead attention mechanism\nextracts and combines inter-group information, resulting in a model that is\n$7.5\\times$ smaller and executes $25\\times$ faster than the current lightest\nstate-of-the-art model. Notably, our method achieves an impressive reduction,\nbeing $4321\\times$ smaller than the best-performing model. We introduce vanilla\nGADS and Hybrid-GADS (landmarks + RGB) and evaluate our models on three\nbenchmark datasets -- AFLW2000, BIWI, and 300W-LP. We envision our architecture\nas a robust baseline for resource-constrained head pose estimation methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the detection of a likely explosive outflow in the\nhigh-mass star-forming complex G34.26+0.15, adding to the small number (six) of\nexplosive outflows detected so far. ALMA CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) archival\nobservations reveal multiple outflow streamers from G34.26+0.15, which\ncorrelate well with H2 jets identified from Spitzer-IRAC 4.5 um and [4.5]/[3.6]\nflux ratio maps. These nearly linear outflow streamers originate from a common\ncenter within an ultracompact HII region located in the complex. The velocity\nspread of the outflow streamers ranges from 0 to 120 km/s. The radial\nvelocities of these streamers follow the Hubble-Lema\\^itre velocity law,\nindicating an explosive nature. From the CO emission, the total outflow mass,\nmomentum, and outflow energy are estimated to be ~264 M_sun, 4.3*10^3 M_sun\nkm/s, and 10^48 erg, respectively. The event triggering the outflow may have\noccurred about 19,000 years ago and could also be responsible for powering the\nexpanding UC HII region, given the similar dynamical ages and positional\ncoincidence of the UC HII region with the origin of the outflow. The magnetic\nfield lines in the region associated with G34.26+0.15 also appear to align with\nthe direction of the outflow streamers and jets, possibly being dragged by the\nexplosive outflow.",

    "abstract": "For planar architectures surface code-based quantum error correction is one\nof the most promising approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation. This is\npartially due to the variety of fault-tolerant logical protocols that can be\nimplemented in two dimensions using local operations. One such protocol is the\nlattice surgery-based logical state teleportation, which transfers a logical\nquantum state from an initial location on a quantum chip to a target location\nthrough a linking region of qubits. This protocol serves as a basis for\nhigher-level routines, such as the entangling CNOT gate or magic state\ninjection. In this work we investigate the correctability phase diagram of this\nprotocol for distinct error rates inside the surface code patches and within\nthe linking region. We adopt techniques from statistical physics to describe\nthe numerically observed crossover regime between correctable and uncorrectable\nquantum error correction phases, where the correctability depends on the\nseparation between the initial and target locations. We find that inside the\ncrossover regime the correctability-threshold lines decay as a power law with\nincreasing separation, which we explain accurately using a finite-size scaling\nanalysis. Our results indicate that the logical state teleportation protocol\ncan tolerate much higher noise rates in the linking region compared to the bulk\nof the surface code patches, provided the separation between the positions is\nrelatively small.",

Ten participants wore the sensor on their dominant hand to capture\nmotion data, including swing speed and swing power, while engaging in a VR\ntennis environment. Initially, participants performed baseline tests without\naccess to performance metrics. In subsequent tests, participants executed\nsimilar routines with their swing data displayed in real-time via a VR overlay.\nQualitative and quantitative results indicated that real-time visual feedback\nled to improved performance behaviors and enhanced situational awareness. Some\nparticipants exhibited increased swing consistency and strategic\ndecision-making, though improvements in accuracy varied individually.\nAdditionally, subjective feedback highlighted that the immersive experience,\ncombined with instantaneous performance metrics, enhanced player engagement and\nmotivation. These findings illustrate the effectiveness of VR-based data\nvisualisation in sports training, suggesting broader applicability in\nperformance enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in\nquantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and\nforce sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain.\nTraditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly\nfocused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements\naligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To\naddress these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high\nnumerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This\nenables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed\nentirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment.\nThe high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a\ndielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled\nmotion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the\nparticle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient\ndetection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform\npaves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles\nand provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the\nintegration of levitated particles.",

One way to\ncircumvent this problem is to introduce mass disorder at lattice sites by\nmixing the components of two or more alloys. Such systems are typically\nstabilized by the entropy of mixing. In this work, using computational tools,\nwe propose a mixed HH, namely, ZrHfCoNiSnSb, which can be formed by the\nelemental compositions of the parent half-Heuslers ZrNiSn/HfNiSn and\nHfCoSb/ZrCoSb. We propose that this new compound can be synthesized at elevated\ntemperatures, as its Gibbs free energy is reduced due to higher configurational\nentropy, making it more thermodynamically stable than the parent compounds\nunder such conditions.

Classical\ndiscrete Morse theory can be viewed as a generalization of Whitehead's\ncollapses, where each Morse function on a simplicial complex $K$ defines a\nsequence of elementary internal collapses. This reduction guarantees the\nexistence of a CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to $K$, with cells\ncorresponding to the critical simplices of the Morse function. However, this\napproach lacks an explicit combinatorial description of the attaching maps,\nwhich limits the reconstruction of the homotopy type of $K$.

We show that, in this setting, the resulting\nreduced CW-complex is regular, enabling us to recover its homotopy type\ncombinatorially.

However, a reliable decision-making agent makes choices\nthat align well with user preferences.\n  In this paper, we generalize existing methods that exploit LLMs for ranking\nalternative outcomes by addressing alignment with the broader and more flexible\nconcept of user preferences, which includes both strict preferences and\nindifference among alternatives. To this end, we put forward design principles\nfor using LLMs to implement rational choice functions, and provide the\nnecessary tools to measure preference satisfaction. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach through an empirical study in a practical\napplication of an IUI in the automotive domain.",

The approach only requires\nminimal system information, which is inherited from a simulation model. The\nnon-linear hydraulic actuation dynamics are modeled using actuator networks\nfrom the data gathered during the manual operation of the manipulator to\neffectively emulate the real system in a simulation environment. A neural\nnetwork control policy for autonomous control, based on end-effector (EE)\nposition tracking is then learned using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process noise (OUNoise) for efficient exploration. The RL\nagent also receives feedback based on supervised learning of the forward\nkinematics which facilitates selecting the best suitable action from\nexploration. The control policy directly provides the joint variables as\noutputs based on provided target EE position while taking into account the\nsystem dynamics. The joint variables are then mapped to the hydraulic valve\ncommands, which are then fed to the system without further modifications. The\nproposed approach is implemented on a scaled hydraulic forwarder crane with\nthree revolute and one prismatic joint to track the desired position of the EE\nin 3-Dimensional (3D) space.

    "abstract": "While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local\nfields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of\nmany-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been\nmuch less explored. We demonstrate that energy diffusion is faster at weak\nrandom fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both\ndiffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the\nsystem. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large\ndistribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field\nconfigurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field\nstrength, the results for sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are\nincompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumed\ntransition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we\nfind indications of the scenario of subdiffusive transport, particularly in the\ndynamical diffusivity response.",

    "abstract": "The opaqueness of modern digital advertising, exemplified by platforms such\nas Meta Ads, raises concerns regarding their autonomous control over audience\ntargeting, pricing structures, and ad relevancy assessments. Locked in their\nleading positions by network effects, ``Metas and Googles of the world''\nattract countless advertisers who rely on intuition, with billions of dollars\nlost on ineffective social media ads. The platforms' algorithms use huge\namounts of data unavailable to advertisers, and the algorithms themselves are\nopaque as well. This lack of transparency hinders the advertisers' ability to\nmake informed decisions and necessitates efforts to promote transparency,\nstandardize industry metrics, and strengthen regulatory frameworks. In this\nwork, we propose novel ways to assist marketers in optimizing their advertising\nstrategies via machine learning techniques designed to analyze and evaluate\ncontent, in particular, predict the click-through rates (CTR) of novel\nadvertising content. Another important problem is that large volumes of data\navailable in the competitive landscape, e.g., competitors' ads, impede the\nability of marketers to derive meaningful insights. This leads to a pressing\nneed for a novel approach that would allow us to summarize and comprehend\ncomplex data. Inspired by the success of ChatGPT in bridging the gap between\nlarge language models (LLMs) and a broader non-technical audience, we propose a\nnovel system that facilitates marketers in data interpretation, called SODA,\nthat merges LLMs with explainable AI, enabling better human-AI collaboration\nwith an emphasis on the domain of digital marketing and advertising. By\ncombining LLMs and explainability features, in particular modern text-image\nmodels, we aim to improve the synergy between human marketers and AI systems.",

Despite much work, all\nknown techniques lead to deterministic algorithms that are not work-efficient.\nFor instance, for the well-studied problem of maximal independent set -- e.g.,\n[Karp, Wigderson STOC'84; Luby STOC' 85; Luby FOCS'88] -- state-of-the-art\ndeterministic algorithms require at least $m \\cdot poly(\\log n)$ work, where\n$m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices. Hence, these deterministic\nalgorithms will remain slower than their trivial sequential counterparts unless\nwe have at least $poly(\\log n)$ processors.\n  In this paper, we present a generic parallel derandomization technique that\nmoves exponentially closer to work-efficiency. The method iteratively rounds\nfractional solutions representing the randomized assignments to integral\nsolutions that provide deterministic assignments, while maintaining certain\nlinear or quadratic objective functions, and in an \\textit{essentially\nwork-efficient} manner.

In this\npaper, they remarked that the value is still unknown for the range $n\\in\n[\\frac{9m}{8}-125, 4m-14]$. In a recent paper, Hu et al. determined the value\nof the book-cycle Ramsey number within the range $n\\in [ \\frac{3m-5}{2}-125,\n4m]$ where $m$ is odd and $n$ is sufficiently large.

These results document that the commutator based functional calculus\nis of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one\nto seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.",

Grammatical subjects are\nconsidered islands because extracting a sub-part of a subject results in an\nill-formed sentence, despite having a clear intended meaning (e.g., \"Which\ntopic did the article about inspire you?\"). The generative tradition, which\nviews syntax as autonomous of meaning and function, attributes this\nungrammaticality to the abstract movement dependency between the wh-phrase and\nthe subject-internal position with which it is associated for interpretation.\nHowever, research on language that emphasizes its communicative function\nsuggests instead that syntactic constraints, including islands, can be\nexplained based on the way different constructions package information.\nAccordingly, Abeill\\'e et al. (2020) suggest that the islandhood of subjects is\nspecific to the information structure of wh-questions, and propose that\nsubjects are not islands for movement, but for focusing, due to their\ndiscourse-backgroundedness. This predicts that other constructions that differ\nin their information structure from wh-questions, but still involve movement,\nshould not create a subject island effect. We test this prediction in three\nlarge-scale acceptability studies, using a super-additive design that singles\nout subject island violations, in three different constructions: wh-questions,\nrelative clauses, and topicalization. We report evidence for a subject island\neffect in each construction type, despite only wh-questions introducing what\nAbeill\\'e et al. (2020) call \"a clash in information structure.\" We argue that\nthis motivates an account of islands in terms of abstract, syntactic\nrepresentations, independent of the communicative function associated with the\nconstructions.",

Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a\npromising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however,\ninterpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and\nintrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three\ncompeting time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant\nintrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and\nModel C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize\nmock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian\nparameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings\ndemonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all\ndatasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated\nunder alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV\nphotons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the\nincorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for\nestablishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in\nthe interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate\nModel C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a\nsubluminal LV scale of \\(E_{\\rm LV} \\simeq 3 \\times 10^{17}\\) GeV based on\nrealistic datasets.

However, the\nformation mechanisms of these post-peak bumps remain a matter of debate.\nFurthermore, previous studies employing the magnetar-powered model have\ntypically assumed a fixed magnetic inclination angle and neglected the effects\nof magnetar precession. However, recent research has shown that the precession\nof newborn magnetars forming during the collapse of massive stars causes the\nmagnetic inclination angle to evolve over time, thereby influencing magnetic\ndipole radiation. In this paper, therefore, we incorporate the effects of\nmagnetar precession into the magnetar-powered model to develop the precessing\nmagnetar-powered model. Using this model, we successfully reproduce the\nmulti-band light curves of 6 selected representative SLSNe-I with post-peak\nbumps. Moreover, the derived model parameters fall within the typical parameter\nrange for SLSNe-I. By combining the precessing magnetars in SLSNe-I and long\nGRBs, we find that the ellipticity of magnetars is related to the dipole\nmagnetic field strength, which may suggest a common origin for the two\nphenomena. Our work provides a potential explanation for the origin of\npost-peak bumps in SLSNe-I and offers evidence for the early precession of\nnewborn magnetars formed in supernova explosions.",

This method bypasses the need for constructing approximate\nlambda operators ($\\Lambda^*$) common in accelerated iterative schemes.\nAdditionally, it requires no extensive precomputed labeled datasets to extract\na supervisory signal, and avoids backpropagating gradients through the complex\nRT solver itself. Finally, we show through experiment that a simple feedforward\nneural network trained greedily cannot solve for SE, possibly due to the moving\ntarget nature of the problem. Our $\\Lambda^*-\\text{Free}$ method offers\npotential advantages for complex scenarios (e.g., atmospheres with enhanced\nvelocity fields, multi-dimensional geometries, or complex microphysics) where\n$\\Lambda^*$ construction or solver differentiability is challenging.\nAdditionally, the agent can be incentivized to find more efficient policies by\nmanipulating the discount factor, leading to a reprioritization of immediate\nrewards. If demonstrated to generalize past its training data, this RL\nframework could serve as an alternative or accelerated formalism to achieve SE.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of\nreinforcement learning in solar physics that directly solves for a fundamental\nphysical constraint.",

The RISC-V \"V\" Vector\nExtension (RVV) enhances algorithm efficiency by supporting vector registers of\ndynamic sizes and their grouping. Nevertheless, for very long vectors, the\nstatic number of RVV vector registers and its power-of-two grouping can lead to\nperformance restrictions.

Additionally, the paper\ndetails Zoozve's compiler and hardware implementations using LLVM and\nSystemVerilog.

The property of decentralization enables adversaries to\ncraft carefully designed backdoor updates to make the global model misclassify\nonly when encountering adversary-chosen triggers. Existing defense mechanisms\nmainly rely on post-training detection after receiving updates. These methods\neither fail to identify updates which are deliberately fabricated statistically\nclose to benign ones, or show inconsistent performance in different FL training\nstages. The effect of unfiltered backdoor updates will accumulate in the global\nmodel, and eventually become functional. Given the difficulty of ruling out\nevery backdoor update, we propose a backdoor defense paradigm, which focuses on\nproactive robustification on the global model against potential backdoor\nattacks. We first reveal that the successful launching of backdoor attacks in\nFL stems from the lack of conflict between malicious and benign updates on\nredundant neurons of ML models. We proceed to prove the feasibility of\nactivating redundant neurons utilizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in\ncentralized settings, and migrating to FL settings to propose a novel backdoor\ndefense mechanism, TrojanDam. The proposed mechanism has the FL server\ncontinuously inject fresh OOD mappings into the global model to activate\nredundant neurons, canceling the effect of backdoor updates during aggregation.\nWe conduct systematic and extensive experiments to illustrate the superior\nperformance of TrojanDam, over several SOTA backdoor defense methods across a\nwide range of FL settings.",

We derive an\nelasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular\nmaterial and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are\ndominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical\ntension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level\nmechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the\ncritical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue\neither buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of\nelasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the\nwrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in\nsolid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the\ngroove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial\nshape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory.

For context, we also assess two\nlarge language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and\nF1-score serve as evaluation metrics.\n  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score\n(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both\nhigh-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions\n(e.g., Anger, Trust).

AI planning literature has reported\nseveral research efforts on generating explanations of solutions to planning\nproblems. However, explaining the unsolvability of planning problems remains a\nlargely open and understudied problem. A widely practiced approach to plan\ngeneration and automated problem solving, in general, is to decompose tasks\ninto sub-problems that help progressively converge towards the goal. In this\npaper, we propose to adopt the same philosophy of sub-problem identification as\na mechanism for analyzing and explaining unsolvability of planning problems in\nhybrid systems. In particular, for a given unsolvable planning problem, we\npropose to identify common waypoints, which are universal obstacles to plan\nexistence; in other words, they appear on every plan from the source to the\nplanning goal. This work envisions such waypoints as sub-problems of the\nplanning problem and the unreachability of any of these waypoints as an\nexplanation for the unsolvability of the original planning problem. We propose\na novel method of waypoint identification by casting the problem as an instance\nof the longest common subsequence problem, a widely popular problem in computer\nscience, typically considered as an illustrative example for the dynamic\nprogramming paradigm. Once the waypoints are identified, we perform symbolic\nreachability analysis on them to identify the earliest unreachable waypoint and\nreport it as the explanation of unsolvability.

    "abstract": "Infrared dim and small target detection presents a significant challenge due\nto dynamic multi-frame scenarios and weak target signatures in the infrared\nmodality. Traditional low-rank plus sparse models often fail to capture dynamic\nbackgrounds and global spatial-temporal correlations, which results in\nbackground leakage or target loss. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmotion-enhanced nonlocal similarity implicit neural representation (INR)\nframework to address these challenges. We first integrate motion estimation via\noptical flow to capture subtle target movements, and propose multi-frame fusion\nto enhance motion saliency. Second, we leverage nonlocal similarity to\nconstruct patch tensors with strong low-rank properties, and propose an\ninnovative tensor decomposition-based INR model to represent the nonlocal patch\ntensor, effectively encoding both the nonlocal low-rankness and\nspatial-temporal correlations of background through continuous neural\nrepresentations. An alternating direction method of multipliers is developed\nfor the nonlocal INR model, which enjoys theoretical fixed-point convergence.\nExperimental results show that our approach robustly separates dim targets from\ncomplex infrared backgrounds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in\ndetection accuracy and robustness.",

Although existing approaches have shown\npromising results, they inherently suffer from overconfidence issues due to the\nusage of softmax for classification, which can produce unreliable predictions\nwhen encountering unpredictable spoofing attempts. To deal with this\nlimitation, we propose a novel framework called fake audio detection with\nevidential learning (FADEL). By modeling class probabilities with a Dirichlet\ndistribution, FADEL incorporates model uncertainty into its predictions,\nthereby leading to more robust performance in OOD scenarios. Experimental\nresults on the ASVspoof2019 Logical Access (LA) and ASVspoof2021 LA datasets\nindicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of\nbaseline models.

Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of\nhadrons is fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high-energy\nprocesses, including heavy-ion and nucleus--nucleus collisions. At the moment,\nhowever, empirical information about medium modifications of hadrons is\nlimited; therefore, theoretical studies are essential for progress in the\nfield. In the present work, we review theoretical studies of the\nelectromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear\nmatter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the\ndegrees of freedom revealed in experimental studies of low and intermediate\nsquare transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations\nof baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model,\ndeveloped for a free space (vacuum) with the quark--meson coupling model for\nextension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies\nthe baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the\nbaryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with density\nand are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy\nbaryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino--nucleon and\nantineutrino--nucleon cross-sections are reduced compared to the values in free\nspace. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal\nnuclear density and applied to neutrino--hyperon and antineutrino--hyperon\nscattering in dense nuclear matter.",

We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code\ngeneration fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This\nfine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit\ntest generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language\nspecification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model\n(GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design\nbased on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the\nteacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural\nlanguage specification. As a result of this process, every example in our\ndataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language\ndescription, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this\ndataset of 125,777 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in\nfunctional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to\n71.7% and 27.4%, respectively.

The HEAs containing cobalt are unsuitable for\nnuclear applications because of the long-term activation of cobalt. Here, six\nparameters, d-orbital energy level, valance electron concentration, entropy of\nmixing, enthalpy of mixing, atom size differences, and parameter of the entropy\nof mixing ({\\Omega}) were calculated to determine the solid solution phase,\nespecially the FCC phase formation rules in cobalt-free HEAs. HEAs of 4\ncomponents were arc melted to verify the newly developed phase formation rules.\nThe nanomechanical properties of produced HEAs were evaluated using\nnanoindentation. Among the six parameters, the d-orbital energy level and\nvalance electron concentration are the critical factors that determine the FCC\nphase stability in cobalt-free alloys. Interestingly, the d-orbital energy\nlevel can be alone used as a benchmark for developing mechanical properties.",

We first show that the very existence of the sinusoidal\nterm \\(\\sin^2(\\sqrt{2\\Lambda}r)\\), in the BM space-time metric, suggests that\n\\(\\sin^2(\\sqrt{2\\Lambda}r) \\in [0,1],\\) which consequently restricts the range\nof the radial coordinate \\(r\\) to \\(r \\in [0,\\pi/\\sqrt{2\\Lambda}]\\). Moreover,\nwe show that at \\(r = 0\\) and \\(r = \\pi/\\sqrt{2\\Lambda}\\), the magnetized\nBM-spacetime introduces domain walls (infinitely impenetrable hard walls)\nwithin which the KG bosonic fields are allowed to move.

We present results from an X-ray spectral study of M51\nusing 1.3-Ms Chandra data, the most extensive for such a galaxy. This allows\nthe extraction of diffuse X-ray emission spectra from spiral arm\nphase-dependent regions using a logarithmic spiral coordinate system.

In this model, only half of the\ncoronal emission is subject to internal absorption. The best-fit absorbing gas\ncolumn density is roughly twice that inferred from optical extinction of\nstellar light. The temperature distribution shows a mean temperature of $\\sim\n0.1$ keV and an average one-dex dispersion that is enhanced on the spiral arms.\nThe corona's radiative cooling might balance the mechanical energy input from\nstellar feedback.

Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have significantly improved this field by providing\nhigh-quality contextualized embeddings and accurate semantic similarity\nestimates.

Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often based on static rules\nand predefined scenarios, are struggling to adapt to the rapidly evolving\nnature of modern cyberattacks.

The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM)\nprovides an innovative solution to cope with the increasingly severe cyber\nthreats, and its potential in analysing complex attack patterns, predicting\nthreats and assisting real-time response has attracted a lot of attention in\nthe field of cybersecurity, and exploring how to effectively use LLM to defend\nagainst cyberattacks has become a hot topic in the current research field. This\nsurvey examines the applications of LLM from the perspective of the cyber\nattack lifecycle, focusing on the three phases of defense reconnaissance,\nfoothold establishment, and lateral movement, and it analyzes the potential of\nLLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. Meanwhile, we investigate how\nLLM-based security solutions are deployed and applied in different network\nscenarios.

In contrast, DL models excel at capturing complex, nonlinear\npatterns from large datasets but may suffer from limited interpretability, high\ncomputational demands, and overfitting in data-scarce scenarios.\n  This study presents a systematic review of PBMs, DL models, and hybrid PBM-DL\nframeworks, highlighting their applications in agricultural and environmental\nmodelling.

Calibration suffices to\nguarantee that simple best-response to predictions is optimal. However,\ncalibration for high-dimensional prediction outcome spaces requires exponential\ncomputational and statistical complexity. The recent relaxation known as\ndecision calibration ensures the optimality of the simple best-response rule\nwhile requiring only polynomial sample complexity in the dimension of outcomes.\nHowever, known results on calibration and decision calibration crucially rely\non linear loss functions for establishing best-response optimality. A natural\napproach to handle nonlinear losses is to map outcomes $y$ into a feature space\n$\\phi(y)$ of dimension $m$, then approximate losses with linear functions of\n$\\phi(y)$. Unfortunately, even simple classes of nonlinear functions can demand\nexponentially large or infinite feature dimensions $m$. A key open problem is\nwhether it is possible to achieve decision calibration with sample complexity\nindependent of~$m$. We begin with a negative result: even verifying decision\ncalibration under standard deterministic best response inherently requires\nsample complexity polynomial in~$m$. Motivated by this lower bound, we\ninvestigate a smooth version of decision calibration in which decision-makers\nfollow a smooth best-response. This smooth relaxation enables dimension-free\ndecision calibration algorithms. We introduce algorithms that, given\n$\\mathrm{poly}(|A|,1/\\epsilon)$ samples and any initial predictor~$p$, can\nefficiently post-process it to satisfy decision calibration without worsening\naccuracy. Our algorithms apply broadly to function classes that can be\nwell-approximated by bounded-norm functions in (possibly infinite-dimensional)\nseparable RKHS.",

To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT\nbenchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and\n205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165\nreveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers. To address these\nlimitations, we propose STFTrack, an efficient framework for acoustic object\ntracking. It includes two novel modules, a multi-view template fusion module\n(MTFM) and an optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM). The MTFM module\nintegrates multi-view feature of both the original image and the binary image\nof the dynamic template, and introduces a cross-attention-like layer to fuse\nthe spatio-temporal target representations. The OTCM module introduces the\nacoustic-response-equivalent pixel property and proposes normalized pixel\nbrightness response scores, thereby suppressing suboptimal matches caused by\ninaccurate Kalman filter prediction boxes. To further improve the model\nfeature, STFTrack introduces a acoustic image enhancement method and a\nFrequency Enhancement Module (FEM) into its tracking pipeline. Comprehensive\nexperiments show the proposed STFTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe proposed benchmark. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/SonarT165.",

Self-energy and vacuum polarization graphs reveal\nhow LIV effects transfer across sectors, influencing particle kinematics. Due\nto these loop effects, constraints from cosmic-ray observations and other\nEarth-based experiments impose limits on induced LIV parameters that would\notherwise be less constrained. We show that while interaction-based LIV effects\nrequire unrealistically large parameters for detection, modifications to\ndispersion relations can be probed down to $\\delta \\sim 10^{-8} \\text{ to }\n10^{-9}$ at the LHC. This suggests that accelerator-based resonance studies\nprovide a promising avenue for stringent LIV constraints, potentially rivaling\nastrophysical observations.",

We study\nthe warm multi-natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic\ntemperature-dependent dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by\naxion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a\ndimension-five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a\nthermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with\ncurrent observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find\nthat the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from\na weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of\nthe inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature\nperturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced\ngravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave\ndetectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other\nparameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong\ndissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to\noverproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained\nby nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of\nparameters.",

This study compares the\nnext-token prediction performance of two well-known models: OpenAI's GPT-2 and\nMeta's Llama-2-7b-chat-hf on Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks. To evaluate their\ncapabilities, we built a dataset from 10 short stories sourced from the Explore\nToM Dataset. We enhanced these stories by programmatically inserting additional\nsentences (infills) using GPT-4, creating variations that introduce different\nlevels of contextual complexity. This setup enables analysis of how increasing\ncontext affects model performance. We tested both models under four temperature\nsettings (0.01, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) and evaluated their ability to predict the next\ntoken across three reasoning levels. Zero-order reasoning involves tracking the\nstate, either current (ground truth) or past (memory). First-order reasoning\nconcerns understanding another's mental state (e.g., \"Does Anne know the apple\nis salted?\"). Second-order reasoning adds recursion (e.g., \"Does Anne think\nthat Charles knows the apple is salted?\").\n  Our results show that adding more infill sentences slightly reduces\nprediction accuracy, as added context increases complexity and ambiguity.\nLlama-2 consistently outperforms GPT-2 in prediction accuracy, especially at\nlower temperatures, demonstrating greater confidence in selecting the most\nprobable token. As reasoning complexity rises, model responses diverge more.\nNotably, GPT-2 and Llama-2 display greater variability in predictions during\nfirst- and second-order reasoning tasks.

The observed double-peaked spin pulse profile in [PK2008] HalphaJ115927\nlikely results from two-pole accretion, where both poles contribute to the spin\nmodulation, and their geometry allows equal visibility of both accreting poles.\nIn contrast, IGR J14091-610 exhibits a single-peaked sinusoidal like spin\npulse, attributed to the changing visibility of the accretion curtains due to a\nrelatively low dipole inclination.

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous radio transients with millisecond\nduration. For some active repeaters, such as FRBs 20121102A and 20201124A, more\nthan a thousand bursts have been detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture\nSpherical radio Telescope (FAST). The waiting time (WT) distributions of both\nrepeaters, defined as the time intervals between adjacent (detected) bursts,\nexhibit a bimodal structure well-fitted by two log-normal functions. Notably,\nthe time scales of the long-duration WT peaks for both repeaters show a\ndecreasing trend over time. These similar burst features suggest that there may\nbe a common physical mechanism for FRBs~20121102A and 20201124A. In this paper,\nwe {revisit} the neutron star (NS)--white dwarf (WD) binary model with an\neccentric orbit to account for the observed changes in the long-duration WT\npeaks. According to our model, the shortening of the WT peaks corresponds to\nthe orbital period decay of the NS-WD binary. We consider two mass transfer\nmodes, namely, stable and unstable mass transfer, to examine how the orbital\nperiod evolves. Our findings reveal distinct evolutionary pathways for the two\nrepeaters: for FRB~20121102A, the NS-WD binary likely undergoes a combination\nof common envelope (CE) ejection and Roche lobe overflow, whereas for\nFRB~20201124A the system may experience multiple CE ejections. These findings\nwarrant further validation through follow-up observations.",

Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on\nspecific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning\nphase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire \"lifechain\" of LLMs.\nTo address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of\n\"full-stack\" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the\nentire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization.\nCompared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several\ndistinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete\nLLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training,\ndeployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the\nfirst safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive\nLiterature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over\n800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of\nsecurity issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights.\nThrough systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and\nperspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research\ndirections, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model\nediting, and LLM-based agent systems.

On the contrary, decision-makers who use predictions\nmake optimal decisions discontinuously in probabilistic space, experiencing\nloss from miscalibration discontinuously. Calibration errors for\ndecision-making are thus discontinuous, e.g., Expected Calibration Error\n(Foster and Vohra, 1997), and Calibration Decision Loss (Hu and Wu, 2024).\nThus, predictors with a low calibration error for machine learning may suffer a\nhigh calibration error for decision-making, i.e., they may not be trustworthy\nfor decision-makers optimizing assuming their predictions are correct.

Many applications\nof hierarchical clustering involve sensitive user information, therefore\nmotivating recent studies on differentially private hierarchical clustering\nunder the rigorous framework of Dasgupta's objective. However, it has been\nshown that any privacy-preserving algorithm under edge-level differential\nprivacy necessarily suffers a large error. To capture practical applications of\nthis problem, we focus on the weight privacy model, where each edge of the\ninput graph is at least unit weight. We present a novel algorithm in the weight\nprivacy model that shows significantly better approximation than known\nimpossibility results in the edge-level DP setting. In particular, our\nalgorithm achieves $O(\\log^{1.5}n/\\varepsilon)$ multiplicative error for\n$\\varepsilon$-DP and runs in polynomial time, where $n$ is the size of the\ninput graph, and the cost is never worse than the optimal additive error in\nexisting work. We complement our algorithm by showing if the unit-weight\nconstraint does not apply, the lower bound for weight-level DP hierarchical\nclustering is essentially the same as the edge-level DP, i.e.\n$\\Omega(n^2/\\varepsilon)$ additive error. As a result, we also obtain a new\nlower bound of $\\tilde{\\Omega}(1/\\varepsilon)$ additive error for balanced\nsparsest cuts in the weight-level DP model, which may be of independent\ninterest. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets.

A novel\noptimization method is proposed, combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an edge\ncollaboration mechanism.

This enables dynamic resource coordination and task\nallocation among multiple devices. During the modeling process, device status,\ntask load, and network resources are jointly incorporated into the state space.\nThe DQN is used to approximate and learn the optimal scheduling strategy. To\nenhance the model's ability to perceive inter-device relationships, a\ncollaborative graph structure is introduced to model the multi-device\nenvironment and assist in decision optimization. Experiments are conducted\nusing real-world IoT data collected from the FastBee platform. Several\ncomparative and validation tests are performed, including energy efficiency\ncomparisons across different scheduling strategies, robustness analysis under\nvarying task loads, and evaluation of state dimension impacts on policy\nconvergence speed.

Nevertheless, the fundamental problems of formulating nonmetric\nEinstein-Dirac-Maxwell (EDM), equations, and studying important nonmetric\ngravitational, electromagnetic and fermion effects have not been solved in\nMGTs. The main goal of this work is to elaborate on a model of nonmetric EDM\ntheory as a generalisation of f(Q) gravity. We develop our anholonomic frame\nand connection deformation method, which allows us to decouple in a general\nform and integrate nonmetric gravitational and matter field equations. New\nclasses of generated quasi-stationary solutions are defined by effective\nsources with Dirac and Maxwell fields, nonmetricity and torsion fields, and\ngenerating functions depending, in general, on all space-time coordinates. For\nrespective nonholonomic parameterisations, such solutions describe nonmetric\nEDM deformations of BH and cosmological metrics. Variants of nonmetric BH, WH\nand toroid solutions with locally anisotropic polarisations of the\ngravitational vacuum, masses of fermions, and effective electromagnetic sources\nare constructed and analysed. Such nonmetric deformed physical objects can't be\ncharacterised in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking paradigm if certain\neffective horizon/ holographic configurations are not involved.

A natural\nquestion to ask is, can the leader improve their strategy by learning about the\nunknown follower through repeated interactions? A well known folk theorem from\ndynamic pricing, a special case of this leader-follower setting, would suggest\nthat the leader cannot learn effectively from the follower when the follower is\nfully strategic, leading to a large literature on learning in strategic\nsettings that relies on limiting the strategic space of the follower in order\nto provide positive results. In this paper, we study dynamic Bayesian\nStackelberg games, where a leader and a \\emph{fully strategic} follower\ninteract repeatedly, with the follower's type unknown. Contrary to existing\nresults, we show that the leader can improve their utility through learning in\nrepeated play. Using a novel average-case analysis, we demonstrate that\nlearning is effective in these settings, without needing to weaken the\nfollower's strategic space. Importantly, this improvement is not solely due to\nthe leader's ability to commit, nor does learning simply substitute for\ncommunication between the parties. We provide an algorithm, based on a\nmixed-integer linear program, to compute the optimal leader policy in these\ngames and develop heuristic algorithms to approximate the optimal dynamic\npolicy more efficiently. Through simulations, we compare the efficiency and\nruntime of these algorithms against static policies.",

    "abstract": "Due to the growing demand for privacy protection, encrypted tunnels have\nbecome increasingly popular among mobile app users, which brings new challenges\nto app fingerprinting (AF)-based network management. Existing methods primarily\ntransfer traditional AF methods to encrypted tunnels directly, ignoring the\ncore obfuscation and re-encapsulation mechanism of encrypted tunnels, thus\nresulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose DecETT, a\ndual decouple-based semantic enhancement method for accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels. Specifically, DecETT improves AF under encrypted tunnels from two\nperspectives: app-specific feature enhancement and irrelevant tunnel feature\ndecoupling.Considering the obfuscated app-specific information in encrypted\ntunnel traffic, DecETT introduces TLS traffic with stronger app-specific\ninformation as a semantic anchor to guide and enhance the fingerprint\ngeneration for tunnel traffic. Furthermore, to address the app-irrelevant\ntunnel feature introduced by the re-encapsulation mechanism, DecETT is designed\nwith a dual decouple-based fingerprint enhancement module, which decouples the\ntunnel feature and app semantic feature from tunnel traffic separately, thereby\nminimizing the impact of tunnel features on accurate app fingerprint\nextraction. Evaluation under five prevalent encrypted tunnels indicates that\nDecETT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels, and further demonstrates its superiority under tunnels with more\ncomplicated obfuscation. \\textit{Project page:\n\\href{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}}",

    "abstract": "Real-world robot manipulation in dynamic unstructured environments requires\nlifelong adaptability to evolving objects, scenes and tasks. Traditional\nimitation learning relies on static training paradigms, which are ill-suited\nfor lifelong adaptation. Although Continual Imitation Learnin (CIL) enables\nincremental task adaptation while preserving learned knowledge, current CIL\nmethods primarily overlook the intrinsic skill characteristics of robot\nmanipulation or depend on manually defined and rigid skills, leading to\nsuboptimal cross-task knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose\nSkill Prompts-based HiErarchical Continual Imitation Learning (SPECI), a novel\nend-to-end hierarchical CIL policy architecture for robot manipulation. The\nSPECI framework consists of a multimodal perception and fusion module for\nheterogeneous sensory information encoding, a high-level skill inference module\nfor dynamic skill extraction and selection, and a low-level action execution\nmodule for precise action generation. To enable efficient knowledge transfer on\nboth skill and task levels, SPECI performs continual implicit skill acquisition\nand reuse via an expandable skill codebook and an attention-driven skill\nselection mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce mode approximation to augment\nthe last two modules with task-specific and task-sharing parameters, thereby\nenhancing task-level knowledge transfer.

In such settings,\nwe show that this adaptive Langevin trajectory converges on a\ndimension-independent time horizon to an equilibrium state that is\ncharacterized by a system of scalar fixed-point equations, and the associated\nprior parameter converges to a critical point of a replica-symmetric limit for\nthe model free energy.

The rapid advancement of deep learning offers an effective\nsolution for generating virtually stained images, significantly reducing the\ntime and labor costs associated with traditional histochemical staining.\nHowever, a new challenge arises in separating the fundamental visual\ncharacteristics of tissue sections from the visual differences induced by\nstaining agents. Additionally, virtual staining often overlooks essential\npathological knowledge and the physical properties of staining, resulting in\nonly style-level transfer. To address these issues, we introduce, for the first\ntime in virtual staining tasks, a pathological vision-language large model\n(VLM) as an auxiliary tool. We integrate contrastive learnable prompts,\nfoundational concept anchors for tissue sections, and staining-specific concept\nanchors to leverage the extensive knowledge of the pathological VLM. This\napproach is designed to describe, frame, and enhance the direction of virtual\nstaining. Furthermore, we have developed a data augmentation method based on\nthe constraints of the VLM. This method utilizes the VLM's powerful image\ninterpretation capabilities to further integrate image style and structural\ninformation, proving beneficial in high-precision pathological diagnostics.\nExtensive evaluations on publicly available multi-domain unpaired staining\ndatasets demonstrate that our method can generate highly realistic images and\nenhance the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as glomerular detection and\nsegmentation.

Coupled with the deterministic risk field, it enables dynamic,\nprobabilistic risk inference across time, enabling proactive safety assessment\nunder uncertainty. Evaluations on the highD, inD, and rounD datasets, spanning\nlane changes, turns, and complex merges, demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms traditional approaches (e.g., TTC, THW, RSS, NC\nField) in terms of accuracy, responsiveness, and directional sensitivity, while\nmaintaining strong generalization across scenarios.

This transition occurred under an\ninfrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the\nexcitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and\nsubsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar\nAlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity\nyield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for\nsemiconductors.

The isovector $1^{+-}$ state, which may be associated\nwith the $Z_c(3900)$, is observed to evolve from a bound state to a virtual\nstate as the interaction strength decreases.

Our analysis reveals rotation periods ranging\nfrom 4.6 hours to 447.8 hours. These results support the existence of a spin\nbarrier for Trojans larger than 10 km, with periods clustering between 4 and\n4.8 hours. This spin barrier is roughly twice as long as that observed for\nmain-belt asteroids, suggesting that Jupiter Trojans have significantly lower\nbulk densities, likely due to a higher fraction of ices and volatile materials\nin their composition. We identify three new Trojans with reliable rotation\nperiods near the spin barrier, doubling the number of known Trojans in this\ncritical period range. Using these results, we estimate a mean density of\napproximately 0.52 g/cm^3 for rubble-pile Trojans. Our findings support the\ngrowing evidence that many Trojans are rubble-pile bodies with distinct\nphysical properties compared to main-belt asteroids. Looking forward, we\nanticipate that data from the Vera C.

While the original protocol requires Alice to prepare\nsix quantum states in $Z$, $X$, and $Y$ bases, its reliance on active\nmodulation introduces inherent side-channel vulnerabilities from device\nimperfections. We address this security limitation by integrating a fully\npassive source into the RFI framework. In this paper, we propose a fully\npassive RFI QKD protocol. Our protocol avoids active modulation entirely,\nsuppressing side-channel risks through passive quantum state generation.\nMoreover, by making full utilization of the quantum states generated by the\nfully passive source, we enhance the secure key rate of fully passive protocol.\nWe establish a system model to analyze the performance of the protocol. Through\nthe optimization of post-selection intervals and intensities, we obtain the\nmaximum secure key transmission rate of the protocol. Under ideal\ncircumstances, the secure key transmission rate of our protocol can reach more\nthan 50% of that of the ideal QKD. Under practical conditions, we have\nconsidered the finite-length effect.

We benchmark 16 LLMs, ranging\nfrom general-purpose to domain-specific models, and find that even the\nbest-performing model achieves only 75.8% accuracy, revealing substantial room\nfor improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind\nclosed-source general-purpose models. We publicly release all data and code of\nIPBench and will continue to update it with additional IP-related tasks to\nbetter reflect real-world challenges in the intellectual property domain.",

    "abstract": "EBSD is a foundational technique for characterizing crystallographic\norientation, phase distribution, and lattice strain. Embedded within EBSD\npatterns lies latent information on dislocation structures, subtly encoded due\nto their deviation from perfect crystallinity - a feature often underutilized.\nHere, a novel framework termed orientation-adaptive virtual apertures (OAVA) is\nintroduced. OAVAs enable the generation of virtual images tied to specific\ndiffraction conditions, allowing the direct visualization of individual\ndislocations from a single EBSD map. By dynamically aligning virtual apertures\nin reciprocal space with the local crystallographic orientation, the method\nenhances contrast from defect-related strain fields, mirroring the principles\nof diffraction-contrast imaging in TEM, but without sample tilting. The\napproach capitalizes on the extensive diffraction space captured in a single\nhigh-quality EBSD scan, with its effectiveness enhanced by modern direct\nelectron detectors that offer high-sensitivity at low accelerating voltages,\nreducing interaction volume and improving spatial resolution. We demonstrate\nthat using OAVAs, identical imaging conditions can be applied across a\npolycrystalline field-of-view, enabling uniform contrast in differently\noriented grains. Furthermore, in single-crystal GaN, threading dislocations are\nconsistently resolved. Algorithms for the automated detection of dislocation\ncontrast are presented, advancing defect characterization. By using OAVAs\nacross a wide range of diffraction conditions in GaN, the\nvisibility/invisibility of defects, owing to the anisotropy of the elastic\nstrain field, is assessed and linked to candidate Burgers vectors. Altogether,\nOAVA offers a new and high-throughput pathway for orientation-specific defect\ncharacterization with the potential for automated, large-area defect analysis\nin single and polycrystalline materials.",

This position paper examines over 2,000\nmultilingual (non-English) benchmarks from 148 countries, published between\n2021 and 2024, to evaluate past, present, and future practices in multilingual\nbenchmarking. Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments\namounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly\noverrepresented in these benchmarks.

    "abstract": "As a revolutionary paradigm for intelligently controlling wireless channels,\nintelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology for\nfuture sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications. While IRS-aided\ncommunication systems can achieve attractive high channel gains, existing\nschemes require plenty of IRS elements to mitigate the ``multiplicative\nfading'' effect in cascaded channels, leading to high complexity for real-time\nbeamforming and high signaling overhead for channel estimation. In this paper,\nthe concept of sustainable intelligent element-grouping IRS (IEG-IRS) is\nproposed to overcome those fundamental bottlenecks. Specifically, based on the\nstatistical channel state information (S-CSI), the proposed grouping strategy\nintelligently pre-divide the IEG-IRS elements into multiple groups based on the\nbeam-domain grouping method, with each group sharing the common reflection\ncoefficient and being optimized in real time using the instantaneous channel\nstate information (I-CSI). Then, we further analyze the asymptotic performance\nof the IEG-IRS to reveal the substantial capacity gain in an extremely\nlarge-scale IRS (XL-IRS) aided single-user single-input single-output (SU-SISO)\nsystem. In particular, when a line-of-sight (LoS) component exists, it\ndemonstrates that the combined cascaded link can be considered as a\n``deterministic virtual LoS'' channel, resulting in a sustainable squared array\ngain achieved by the IEG-IRS. Finally, we formulate a weighted-sum-rate (WSR)\nmaximization problem for an IEG-IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input\nsingle-output (MU-MISO) system and a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the\nbeam-domain grouping strategy and the multi-user active-passive beamforming is\nproposed.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous speech translation (SST) outputs translations in parallel with\nstreaming speech input, balancing translation quality and latency. While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality,\nstreaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire\ngeneration process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes\nSimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy\nto guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between\ntraining and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows\nit to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves\nsimultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete\noutput speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained\nvocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of\nspeech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS\nspeech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency\ntrade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as\nimproving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.",

Numerical bugs can lead to system\ncrashes, incorrect output, and wasted computing resources. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel idea, namely soft assertions (SA), to encode safety/error\nconditions for the places where numerical instability can occur. A soft\nassertion is an ML model automatically trained using the dataset obtained\nduring unit testing of unstable functions. Given the values at the unstable\nfunction in an ML application, a soft assertion reports how to change these\nvalues in order to trigger the instability. We then use the output of soft\nassertions as signals to effectively mutate inputs to trigger numerical\ninstability in ML applications. In the evaluation, we used the GRIST benchmark,\na total of 79 programs, as well as 15 real-world ML applications from GitHub.\nWe compared our tool with 5 state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers. We found all the\nGRIST bugs and outperformed the baselines. We found 13 numerical bugs in\nreal-world code, one of which had already been confirmed by the GitHub\ndevelopers. While the baselines mostly found the bugs that report NaN and INF,\nour tool \\tool found numerical bugs with incorrect output.

We thus work in the\ncontext of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data\nare sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are\nextracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes,\nnamely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D\nclustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two\nobservables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\\{\\theta,\n\\Delta z\\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\\Delta z\n\\neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the\ninformation on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO\nfeatures in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows\nthat a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant\nassociated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\\{w_0,w_a\\}$ by at least an order\nof magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and\ngalaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell\nconfigurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up\nto $(\\Delta z)^{\\rm tot}\\sim 0.6$ ($(\\Delta z)^{\\rm tot}\\sim 0.4$) for ADF\n(ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time,\nconfigurations using narrow shell widths ($\\sigma_z \\leq 0.02$) preserve the\ncosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield\nFisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for\nwider shell ($\\sigma_z>0.02$) configurations.",

Challenges\narise due to limited prior data on the specific outcome within the target\npopulation, making accurate ICC estimation difficult. Furthermore, ICC can vary\nsignificantly across studies, even for the same outcome, influenced by factors\nlike study design, participant characteristics, and the specific intervention.\nPower calculations are extremely sensitive to ICC assumptions. Minor variation\nin the assumed ICC can lead to large differences in the number of clusters\nneeded, potentially impacting trial feasibility and cost.\n  This paper identifies a special class of CRTs aiming to detect the treatment\neffect heterogeneity, wherein the ICC can be completely disregarded in\ncalculation of power and sample size. This result offers a solution for\nresearch projects lacking preliminary estimates of the ICC or facing challenges\nin their estimate. Moreover, this design facilitates power improvement through\nincreasing the cluster sizes rather than the number of clusters, making it\nparticular advantageous in the situations where expanding the number of\nclusters is difficult or costly.\n  This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for this class of\nICC-ignorable CRTs, including mathematical proofs and practical guidance for\nimplementation.

We employ the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator\nwithing the REBOUND package to track for 100,000 years the trajectories of\n6,000 test particles launched from various lunar latitudes and longitudes. Our\nmodel incorporates a realistic velocity distribution for ejecta fragments (tens\nof meters in size), derived form large lunar cratering events. Our results show\nthat 22.6% of lunar ejecta collide with Earth, following a power-law $C(t)\n\\propto t^{0.315}$ with half of the impacts occurring within ~10,000 years. We\nalso confirm that impact events on the Moon's trailing hemisphere serve as a\ndominant source of Earth-bound ejecta, consistent with previous studies.\nAdditionally, a small fraction of ejecta remains transiently in near-Earth\nspace, providing evidence that lunar ejecta may contribute to the NEO\npopulation. This aligns with recent discoveries of Earth co-orbitals such as\nKamo'oalewa (469219, 2016 HO3) and 2024 PT5, both exhibiting spectral\nproperties consistent with lunar material.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and societies, ensuring\nits trustworthiness-through mitigating ethical risks like bias, opacity, and\naccountability deficits-remains a global challenge. International Organization\nfor Standardization (ISO) AI standards, such as ISO/IEC 24027 and 24368, aim to\nfoster responsible development by embedding fairness, transparency, and risk\nmanagement into AI systems. However, their effectiveness varies across diverse\nregulatory landscapes, from the EU's risk-based AI Act to China's\nstability-focused measures and the U.S.'s fragmented state-led initiatives.\nThis paper introduces a novel Comparative Risk-Impact Assessment Framework to\nevaluate how well ISO standards address ethical risks within these contexts,\nproposing enhancements to strengthen their global applicability. By mapping ISO\nstandards to the EU AI Act and surveying regulatory frameworks in ten\nregions-including the UK, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and\nBrazil-we establish a baseline for ethical alignment. The framework, applied to\ncase studies in the EU, US-Colorado, and China, reveals gaps: voluntary ISO\nstandards falter in enforcement (e.g., Colorado) and undervalue region-specific\nrisks like privacy (China). We recommend mandatory risk audits, region-specific\nannexes, and a privacy-focused module to enhance ISO's adaptability. This\napproach not only synthesizes global trends but also offers a replicable tool\nfor aligning standardization with ethical imperatives, fostering\ninteroperability and trust in AI worldwide.

Although Guillotine\nborrows some well-known virtualization techniques, Guillotine must also\nintroduce fundamentally new isolation mechanisms to handle the unique threat\nmodel posed by existential-risk AIs.

Beyond such isolation at the software,\nnetwork, and microarchitectural layers, a Guillotine hypervisor must also\nprovide physical fail-safes more commonly associated with nuclear power plants,\navionic platforms, and other types of mission critical systems.

    "abstract": "An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy\nwells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each\nother by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the\nparticles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated\ninteractions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity\nto harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite\nviscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and\nexperiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated\nparticles can access five distinct dynamical states, two of which are\nemergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently\nactive steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a\nclassical time crystal.",
