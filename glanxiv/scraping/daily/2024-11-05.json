    "abstract": "Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection,\nand internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as\nKolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In\ncontrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static\npre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation.\nRecent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection,\nrevision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like\nexperiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable\nof structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In\nresponse, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with\nVygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic\n(environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction)\nfunctions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent\ninitially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended\ngeneralisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains\nthat traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle\neffectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison\nwith humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully\nautomated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K,\ndemonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving\nan Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2%\namong 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals\nlevel performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding\ncompetitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and\nVygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward\ngeneralist AI.",

Current methods for ego-body pose estimation rely on\ntemporally dense sensor data, such as IMU measurements from spatially sparse\nbody parts like the head and hands. However, we propose that even temporally\nsparse observations, such as hand poses captured intermittently from egocentric\nvideos during natural or periodic hand movements, can effectively constrain\noverall body motion. Naively applying diffusion models to generate full-body\npose from head pose and sparse hand pose leads to suboptimal results. To\novercome this, we develop a two-stage approach that decomposes the problem into\ntemporal completion and spatial completion. First, our method employs masked\nautoencoders to impute hand trajectories by leveraging the spatiotemporal\ncorrelations between the head pose sequence and intermittent hand poses,\nproviding uncertainty estimates. Subsequently, we employ conditional diffusion\nmodels to generate plausible full-body motions based on these temporally dense\ntrajectories of the head and hands, guided by the uncertainty estimates from\nthe imputation. The effectiveness of our method was rigorously tested and\nvalidated through comprehensive experiments conducted on various HMD setup with\nAMASS and Ego-Exo4D datasets.",

    "abstract": "Passive flow control via fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is a promising\nparadigm for unmanned aerial vehicles operating in vortex-dominated low\nReynolds number regimes. A flexible structure has the potential to passively\nalter key unsteady vortex structures through its vibrations if its intrinsic\nmodal dynamics are carefully aligned with the driving flow processes. Towards\nthis aim, we perform high-fidelity numerical FSI simulations to study the\ndynamic interplay between a separated aerodynamic flow with vortex shedding (Re\n= 500 and angle of attack of 15$^{\\circ}$) and a flexible flat plate modeled\nusing linear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. To isolate the natural\nevolution/instability mechanisms of the coupled dynamics, we start our\nsimulations from a steady base state of the FSI system. We focus on open\nquestions related to the coupled dynamics: (i) Do the early-time dynamics that\nevolve from the base state involve a coupled or flow-driven instability?; (ii)\nhow are the flow dynamics and associated lift informed by the modal shape(s)\nand deformation timescales of the structural response, and how is this\nstructural response informed by the structural parameters relative to the\nvortex-shedding behavior of the reference (rigid) case? For question (i), we\nidentify that the departure from the base state arises from a flow-induced\ninstability, suggesting that it is the vortex shedding of the aerodynamic flow\nthat instigates structural motion. For question (ii), we further clarify how\nthe structural mode dynamics in the FSI setting are dictated by the\nrelationship between the vacuum fundamental frequencies of the structure and\nthe baseline rigid-plate shedding frequency. We show that the long-time FSI\ndynamics can be partitioned into distinct regimes categorized by the dominant\nmode of the structural dynamics. The coupled dynamics in each regime are\ndescribed in detail in the manuscript.",

These\nanalog computing platforms embed information in physical properties and then\nuse the physics of materials, devices, and circuits to perform computation.\nThese hardware platforms are more sensitive to nonidealities, such as noise and\nfabrication variations, than their digital counterparts and accrue high\nresource costs when programmable elements are introduced. Identifying\nresource-efficient analog system designs that mitigate these nonidealities is\ndone manually today.\n  While design optimization frameworks have been enormously successful in other\nfields, such as photonics, they typically either target linear dynamical\nsystems that have closed-form solutions or target a specific differential\nequation system and then derive the solution through hand analysis. In both\ncases, time-domain simulation is no longer needed to predict hardware behavior.\nIn contrast, described analog hardware platforms have nonlinear time-evolving\ndynamics that vary substantially from design to design, lack closed-form\nsolutions, and require the optimizer to consider time explicitly.

By integrating VQ-ACE with both Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), we enable more efficient\nexploration and policy learning in dexterous manipulation tasks using a\nbiomimetic robotic hand.

Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y\ndwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from lambda = 4.5 um to\nlambda = 10 um is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using\nPH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated WISE W2 - W3 colors. We find that an\nabsolute 4.5 um flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the\n4.5 um flux to the 10 - 15 um flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive\nto metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2 - W3 colors which are\nlikely to be very low gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is\nthe previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA\nJ182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2 - W3 and we find that the 4 to 18 um JWST\nspectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high gravity 400 K\ndwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective\ntemperatures for late-T and Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++\nmodels, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our\nunderstanding of cold very low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.",

By generalizing the matrix\nproduct state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical\nmixture correlations, the MP$\\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this\nwork we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated\nwith the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented\nperspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the\ncanonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve\nunder the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to\noptimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also\nscale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling\nhardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an\nexample of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e.,\ndecohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental\ninteractions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into\nglobal incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the\nrepresentation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect\nthis work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond\nqubit engineering.",

However, a\ngeneral framework for the thorough and systematic classification and\ncharacterization of these exotic states of matter has been lacking, as has an\nexhaustive list of all possible spin liquids that this model can support and,\nperhaps most interesting, what is the corresponding structure of their emergent\nfield theory description.

Motivated by recent theoretical advances in machine learning and the\nintuitive observation that human experts continue to learn from practice even\nafter mastery, we hypothesize that task-specific representation learning can\ncontinue, even when behavior plateaus. In a novel reanalysis of recently\npublished neural data, we find evidence for such learning in posterior piriform\ncortex of mice following continued training on a task, long after behavior\nsaturates at near-ceiling performance (\"overtraining\"). This learning is marked\nby an increase in decoding accuracy from piriform neural populations and\nimproved performance on held-out generalization tests. We demonstrate that\nclass representations in cortex continue to separate during overtraining, so\nthat examples that were incorrectly classified at the beginning of overtraining\ncan abruptly be correctly classified later on, despite no changes in behavior\nduring that time. We hypothesize this hidden yet rich learning takes the form\nof approximate margin maximization; we validate this and other predictions in\nthe neural data, as well as build and interpret a simple synthetic model that\nrecapitulates these phenomena.

This paper proposes the same approach\nfor dense problems and shows that with a shift chosen in accordance with\ncertain constraints, the algorithm can conditionally ensure that every computed\nshifted and inverted eigenvalue is close to the exact shifted and inverted\neigenvalue of a pair of matrices close to $A$ and $B$. Under the same\nassumptions on the shift, the analysis of the algorithm for the shifted and\ninverted problem leads to useful error bounds for the original problem,\nincluding a bound that shows how a single shift that is of moderate size in a\nscaled sense can be chosen so that every computed generalized eigenvalue\ncorresponds to a generalized eigenvalue of a pair of matrices close to $A$ and\n$B$. The computed generalized eigenvectors give a relative residual that\ndepends on the distance between the corresponding generalized eigenvalue and\nthe shift. If the shift is of moderate size, then relative residuals are small\nfor generalized eigenvalues that are not much larger than the shift. Larger\nshifts give small relative residuals for generalized eigenvalues that are not\nmuch larger or smaller than the shift.",

    "abstract": "Message aggregation is often used with a goal to reduce communication cost in\nHPC applications. The difference in the order of overhead of sending a message\nand cost of per byte transferred motivates the need for message aggregation,\nfor several irregular fine-grained messaging applications like graph algorithms\nand parallel discrete event simulation (PDES). While message aggregation is\nfrequently utilized in \"MPI-everywhere\" model, to coalesce messages between\nprocesses mapped to cores, such aggregation across threads in a process, say in\nMPI+X models or Charm++ SMP (Shared Memory Parallelism) mode, is often avoided.\nWithin-process coalescing is likely to require synchronization across threads\nand lead to performance issues from contention. However, as a result,\nSMP-unaware aggregation mechanisms may not fully utilize aggregation\nopportunities available to applications in SMP mode. Additionally, while the\nbenefit of message aggregation is often analyzed in terms of reducing the\noverhead, specifically the per message cost, we also analyze different schemes\nthat can aid in reducing the message latency, ie. the time from when a message\nis sent to the time when it is received. Message latency can affect several\napplications like PDES with speculative execution where reducing message\nlatency could result in fewer rollbacks. To address these challenges, in our\nwork, we demonstrate the effectiveness of shared memory-aware message\naggregation schemes for a range of proxy applications with respect to messaging\noverhead and latency.",

However, costly computation\nassociated with numerical simulation poses a significant bottleneck, hindering\nscalability and turnaround time in the photonic circuit design process. Neural\noperators offer a promising alternative, but existing SOTA approaches,\nNeurOLight, struggle with predicting high-fidelity fields for real-world\ncomplicated photonic devices, with the best reported 0.38 normalized mean\nabsolute error in NeurOLight. The inter-plays of highly complex light-matter\ninteraction, e.g., scattering and resonance, sensitivity to local structure\ndetails, non-uniform learning complexity for full-domain simulation, and rich\nfrequency information, contribute to the failure of existing neural PDE\nsolvers. In this work, we boost the prediction fidelity to an unprecedented\nlevel for simulating complex photonic devices with a novel operator design\ndriven by the above challenges.

    "abstract": "The exponential growth in data availability in recent years has led to new\nformulations of data-driven optimization problems. One such formulation is that\nof stochastic optimization problems with contextual information, where the goal\nis to optimize the expected value of a certain function given some contextual\ninformation (also called features) that accompany the main data of interest.\nThe contextual information then allows for a better estimation of the quantity\nof interest via machine learning methods, thereby leading to better solutions.\nOftentimes, however, machine learning methods yield just a pointwise estimate\ninstead of an entire distribution. In this paper we show that, when the problem\nto be solved is a class of two-stage stochastic programs (namely, those with\nfixed recourse matrix and fixed costs), under mild assumptions the problem can\nbe solved with just one scenario. While such a scenario - which does not have\nbe unique - is usually unknown, we present an integrated learning and\noptimization procedure that yields the best approximation of that scenario\nwithin the modeler's pre-specified set of parameterized forecast functions.\nNumerical results conducted with inventory problems from the literature (with\nsynthetic data) as well as a bike-sharing problem with real data demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach performs well when compared to benchmark methods\nfrom the literature.",

In\nthis paper we analyze self-supervised learning in a natural context:\ndimensionality reduction in Gaussian Mixture Models.

We show that vanilla contrastive learning\n(specifically, the InfoNCE loss) is able to find the optimal lower-dimensional\nsubspace even when the Gaussians are not isotropic -- something that vanilla\nspectral techniques cannot do. We also prove a similar result for\n\"non-contrastive\" self-supervised learning (i.e., SimSiam loss). We further\nextend our analyses to multi-modal contrastive learning algorithms (e.g.,\nCLIP).

In nonlinear systems, this framework\nprovides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and\ntopological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its\ntopology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative\nenvironments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework\nenables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological\nprotection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the\nspectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras,\nand not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires\ndeveloping intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than\nthose that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology.\nIn this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a\nground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for\nunderstanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of\ntopological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the\nframework's application to a variety of topological classes, including\ncrystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can\nbe reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework,\nincluding the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this\nintroduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator\npseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that\nform the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.",

We use\nthis score to prune parts of individual layers based on redundancy in such a\nway that the average pruned percentage for all layers is a fixed value.

While approaches based on\nmachine learning dominate modern 3D shape matching, almost all existing\n(learning-based) methods require that at least one of the involved shapes is\ncomplete. In contrast, the most challenging and arguably most practically\nrelevant setting of matching partially observed shapes, is currently\nunderexplored. One important factor is that existing datasets contain only a\nsmall number of shapes (typically below 100), which are unable to serve\ndata-hungry machine learning approaches, particularly in the unsupervised\nregime. In addition, the type of partiality present in existing datasets is\noften artificial and far from realistic. To address these limitations and to\nencourage research on these relevant settings, we provide a generic and\nflexible framework for the procedural generation of challenging partial shape\nmatching scenarios. Our framework allows for a virtually infinite generation of\npartial shape matching instances from a finite set of shapes with complete\ngeometry. Further, we manually create cross-dataset correspondences between\nseven existing (complete geometry) shape matching datasets, leading to a total\nof 2543 shapes.

Recently, Artificial\nintelligence (AI) has been widely introduced to advance these aspects in next\ngeneration wireless systems. However, such AI applications suffer from limited\ntraining data, low robustness, and poor generalization capabilities. To address\nthese issues, a model-driven deep unfolding (DU) algorithm is introduced in\nthis paper to bridge the gap between traditional model-driven communication\nalgorithms and data-driven deep learning. Focusing on the QoS-aware\nrate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) resource allocation problem in multi-user\ncommunications, a conventional fractional programming (FP) algorithm is first\napplied as a benchmark. The solution is then refined by the application of\nprojection gradient descent (PGD). DU is employed to further speed up\nconvergence procedure, hence improving the efficiency of PGD. Moreover, the\nfeasibility of results is guaranteed by designing a low-complexity projection\nbased on scale factors, plus adding violation control mechanisms into the loss\nfunction that minimizes error rates. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of\nthe computational complexity and analysis design of the proposed DU algorithm.\nExtensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that the\nproposed DU algorithm can reach the optimal communication efficiency with a\nmere $0.024\\%$ violation rate for 4 layers DU. The DU algorithm also exhibits\nrobustness in out-of-distribution tests and can be effectively trained with as\nfew as 50 samples.",

    "abstract": "Reliable computational methodologies and basis sets for modeling x-ray\nspectra are essential for extracting and interpreting electronic and structural\ninformation from experimental x-ray spectra. In particular, the trade-off\nbetween numerical accuracy and computational cost due to the size of the basis\nset is a major challenge, since molecular orbitals undergo extreme relaxation\nin the core-hole state. To gain clarity on changes in electronic structure\ninduced by the formation of a core-hole, the use of sufficiently flexible basis\nfor expanding the orbitals, particularly for the core region, has been shown to\nbe essential. This work focuses on the refinement of core-hole ionized state\ncalculations using the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) family of\nmethods through an extensive analysis on the effectiveness of \"hybrid\" and\nmixed basis sets. In this investigation, we utilize the CVS-EOMIP-CCSD method\nin combination and construct hybrid basis sets piece-wise from readily\navailable Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets in order to calculate\nx-ray ionization energies for a set of small gas phase molecules. Our results\nprovide insights into the impact of basis sets on CVS-EOMIP-CCSD calculations\nof K-edge ionization energies of first-row p-block elements.

To address this, we propose the Navigation with Uncertainty-driven\nExploration (NUE) pipeline, which uses an implicit and compact scene\nrepresentation, NeRF, as a cognitive structure.

This network offers a fast and robust method to estimate the\nembedding of arbitrary unregistered meshes into the latent space. Second, we\ncomplement the estimation of latent codes with MoGeN (Motion Geometry Network)\na framework that learns the geometry on the latent space itself. This is\nachieved by lifting the body pose parameter space into a higher dimensional\nEuclidean space in which body motion mini-sequences from a training set of 4D\ndata can be approximated by simple linear interpolation. Using the SMPL latent\nspace representation we illustrate how the combination of these network models,\nonce trained, can be used to perform a variety of tasks with very limited\ncomputational cost. This includes operations such as motion interpolation,\nextrapolation and transfer as well as random shape and pose generation.",

GRATEV2.0 employs fast,\nautomated image processing algorithms, enabling rapid extraction of structural\nfeatures like d-spacing, orientation, and crystal shape metrics. Gaussian\nprocess optimization rapidly identifies the user-defined parameters in the\napproach, reducing the need for manual parameter tuning and thus enhancing\nreproducibility and usability. Additionally, GRATEV2.0 is compatible with\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) environments, allowing for efficient,\nlarge-scale data processing at near real-time speeds. A unique feature of\nGRATEV2.0 is a Wasserstein distance-based stopping criterion, which optimizes\ndata collection by determining when further sampling no longer adds\nstatistically significant information. This capability optimizes the amount of\ntime the TEM facility is used while ensuring data adequacy for in-depth\nanalysis.

    "abstract": "A high resolution fourth-order Pad\\'e scheme is used to simulate locally\nisothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI)\nusing 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI,\nangular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial\nprofiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies\ndominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently\ndiscovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These\nfeatures are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically\nand azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers containing small vortices with\nall three vorticity components active. Previously observed large persistent\nvortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability\nare absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum\nstaircase in 3D in the present simulations compared to a previous simulation.\nThe turbulent viscosity parameter $\\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At\nintermediate resolution, the value of $\\alpha(r)$ at midradius is close to that\nof a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to\nradial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the\nvalue $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal\nwavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier\nstudy. Finally, it is found that axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times,\nincluding a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present\nweakly in the disk's upper layers.",

To ensure the\nreliability of modern control algorithms utilized in these vessels, digital\ntwins (DTs) provide a robust framework for conducting safe and effective\nsimulations within a virtual environment. Digital twins are generally\nclassified on a scale from 0 to 5, with each level representing a progression\nin complexity and functionality: Level 0 (Standalone) employs offline modeling\ntechniques; Level 1 (Descriptive) integrates sensors and online modeling to\nenhance situational awareness; Level 2 (Diagnostic) focuses on condition\nmonitoring and cybersecurity; Level 3 (Predictive) incorporates predictive\nanalytics; Level 4 (Prescriptive) embeds decision-support systems; and Level 5\n(Autonomous) enables advanced functionalities such as collision avoidance and\npath following. These digital representations not only provide insights into\nthe vessel's current state and operational efficiency but also predict future\nscenarios and assess life endurance. By continuously updating with real-time\nsensor data, the digital twin effectively corrects modeling errors and enhances\ndecision-making processes.

Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly\nlimited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of\nthe E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations\nfrom the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of\nupcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address\nlarge-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck.\nTo this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power\nspectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification\nin the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM\nprescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements\nfrom LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial\nand late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these\nscales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are\ndetermined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future\nexperiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical\nfluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose\nmore stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models\npredict at smaller scales (l>100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a\nrecently proposed \"Dark Dimension\" scenario, featuring power amplification at\nlarge scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the\nstandard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that\nfuture CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale\nanomalies that are present in the current CMB data.",

    "abstract": "Detecting mitigating and correcting errors in quantum control is among the\nmost pertinent contemporary problems in quantum technologies. We consider three\nof the most common bosonic error correction codes -- the CLY, binomial and dual\nrail and compare their performance under typical errors in bosonic systems. We\nfind that the dual rail code shows the best performance. We also develop a new\ntechnique for error mitigation in quantum control. We consider a quantum system\nwith large Hilbert space dimension, e.g., a qudit or a multi-qubit system and\nconstruct two $2- $ dimensional subspaces -- a code space, $\\mathcal C =\n\\text{span}\\{|\\bar{0}\\rangle, |\\bar{1}\\rangle\\}$ where the logical qubit is\nencoded and a ``proxy'' space $\\mathcal P = \\text{span}\\{|\\bar{0}'\\rangle,\n|\\bar{1}'\\rangle\\}$. While the qubit (i.e., $\\mathcal C$) can be a part of a\nquantum circuit, the proxy (i.e., $\\mathcal P$) remains idle. In the absence of\nerrors, the quantum state of the proxy qubit does not evolve in time. If\n$\\mathcal E$ is an error channel acting on the full system, we consider its\nprojections on $\\mathcal C$ and $\\mathcal P$ represented as pauli transfer\nmatrices $T_{\\mathcal E}$ and $T'_{\\mathcal E}$ respectively. Under reasonable\nassumptions regarding the origin of the errors, $T_{\\mathcal E}$ can be\ninferred from $T'_{\\mathcal E}$ acting on the proxy qubit and the latter can be\nmeasured without affecting the qubit. The latter can be measured while the\nqubit is a part of a quantum circuit because, one can perform simultaneous\nmeasurements on the logical and the proxy qubits. We use numerical data to\nlearn an \\textit{affine map} $\\phi$ such that $T_{\\mathcal E} \\approx\n\\phi(T'_{\\mathcal E})$.

Confirming if planetary bodies acquire the same refractory element\ncomposition as their natal disc during formation, and how efficiently volatile\nelements are incorporated into growing planets, is key to linking the poorly\nconstrained interior composition of rocky exoplanets to the\nobservationally-constrained composition of their host star. Such comparisons\nalso afford insight into the planet formation process. This work compares\nplanetary composition with host-star composition using observations of a white\ndwarf that has accreted planetary material and its F-type star wide binary\ncompanion as a reference for the composition of the natal molecular gas and\ndust. Spectroscopic analysis reveals abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti in\nboth stars. We use the white dwarf measurements to estimate the composition of\nthe exoplanetary material and the F-type companion to constrain the composition\nof the material the planet formed from. Comparing planetary material to the\ncomposition of its natal cloud, our results reveal that the planetary material\nis depleted in moderate refractories (Mg, Si, Fe) relative to the refractory\nmaterial (Ca, Ti). Grouping elements based on their condensation temperatures\nis key to linking stellar and planetary compositions. Fractionation during\nformation or subsequent planetary evolution leads to the depletion of moderate\nrefractories from the planetary material accreted by the white dwarf. This\nsignature, as seen for bulk Earth, will likely be present in the composition of\nmany exoplanets relative to their host-stars.",

This review begins\nby first addressing the critical, earliest stage of dust coagulation and\nconcentration. While classic studies revealed how objects that grow to\n$\\sim$meter sizes are rapidly removed from protoplanetary disks via orbital\ndecay (seemingly precluding growth to larger sizes), this chapter addresses how\nthis is resolved in contemporary, streaming instability models that favor rapid\nplanetesimal formation via gravitational collapse of solids in over-dense\nregions. Once formed, planetesimals grow into Mars-Earth-sized planetary\nembryos by a combination of pebble- and planetesimal accretion within the\nlifetime of the nebular disk. After the disk dissipates, these embryos\ntypically experience a series of late giant impacts en route to attaining their\nfinal architectures. This review also highlights three different inner Solar\nSystem formation models that can match a number of empirical constraints, and\nalso reviews ways that one or more might be ruled out in favor of another in\nthe near future. These include (1) the Grand Tack, (2) the Early Instability\nand (3) Planet Formation from Rings. Additionally, this chapter discusses\nformation models for the closest known analogs to our own terrestrial planets:\nsuper-Earths and terrestrial exoplanets in systems also hosting gas giants.\nFinally, this review lays out a chain of events that may explain why the Solar\nSystem looks different than more than 99% of exoplanet systems.",

Moreover, it does not account for dark matter (DM). In\nthis paper, we propose a minimal extension that introduces a dark sector with a\nsinglet Majorana fermion (as the DM candidate) and a complex scalar singlet.\nThe heavy right-handed neutrinos serve another role beyond generating neutrino\nmasses and the BAU: producing the cold DM density through their decays.\nInterestingly, the model also predicts a subdominant DM component from late\nscalar decays, which in some cases may be hot or warm at the onset of structure\nformation, as well as an equal number of non-thermal neutrinos. These\ncomponents leave distinct signatures in various cosmological observables.\nFurthermore, electromagnetic energy injection from scalar decays alter\npredictions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and induce spectral distortions in\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background black-body spectrum.

Subsequent extensions have yielded sparsifiers for hypergraph cuts and\nmore recently linear codes over Abelian groups. A decade ago, Kogan and\nKrauthgamer asked about the sparsifiability of arbitrary constraint\nsatisfaction problems (CSPs). For this question, a trivial lower bound is the\nsize of a non-redundant CSP instance, which admits, for each constraint, an\nassignment satisfying only that constraint (so that no constraint can be\ndropped by the sparsifier). For graph cuts, spanning trees are non-redundant\ninstances.\n  Our main result is that redundant clauses are sufficient for sparsification:\nfor any CSP predicate R, every unweighted instance of CSP(R) has a sparsifier\nof size at most its non-redundancy (up to polylog factors). For weighted\ninstances, we similarly pin down the sparsifiability to the so-called chain\nlength of the predicate. These results precisely determine the extent to which\nany CSP can be sparsified. A key technical ingredient in our work is a novel\napplication of the entropy method from Gilmer's recent breakthrough on the\nunion-closed sets conjecture.\n  As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, a number of results in the\nnon-redundancy literature immediately extend to CSP sparsification. We also\ncontribute new techniques for understanding the non-redundancy of CSP\npredicates. In particular, we give an explicit family of predicates whose\nnon-redundancy roughly corresponds to the structure of matching vector families\nin coding theory. By adapting methods from the matching vector codes\nliterature, we are able to construct an explicit predicate whose non-redundancy\nlies between $\\Omega(n^{1.5})$ and $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1.6})$, the first example\nwith a provably non-integral exponent.",

Our model accounts for (i) PBH\naccretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction.\nPBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense\ncore, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading\nto the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\\sim\n20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\\sim 10^7\\ M_\\odot$ corresponding to $\\sim 5-7\\sigma$\nfluctuations), and provides massive ($\\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\\odot}$) seeds by\n$z\\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that\nprovides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\\rm seed}(z)=3.1\\times 10^{5}\\ {\nM_{\\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\\times 10^{9}\\\n{M_{\\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding\nmechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs,\nnamely $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\\sim 6-7$ quasars can\nbe explained with $6\\times 10^4 M_{\\rm \\odot}$ seeds planted at $z\\sim 32$, and\ngrowing at sub-Eddington rates, $\\langle\\lambda_{\\rm E}\\rangle\\sim 0.55$. The\nsame scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1\n($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\\sim\n20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\\rm \\odot}$) seeds.

    "abstract": "Charged particle emission from black holes with sufficiently large charge is\nexponentially suppressed. As a result, such black holes are driven towards\nextremality by the emission of neutral Hawking radiation. Eventually, an\nisolated black hole gets close enough to extremality that the gravitational\nbackreaction of a single Hawking photon becomes important, and the QFT in\ncurved spacetime approximation breaks down. To proceed further, we need to use\na quantum theory of gravity. We make use of recent progress in our\nunderstanding of the quantum-gravitational thermodynamics of near-extremal\nblack holes to compute the corrected spectrum for both neutral and charged\nHawking radiation, including the effects of backreaction, greybody factors, and\nmetric fluctuations. At low temperatures, large fluctuations in a set of light\nmodes of the metric lead to drastic modifications to neutral particle emission\nthat -- in contrast to the semiclassical prediction -- ensure the black hole\nremains subextremal. Relatedly, angular momentum constraints mean that, close\nenough to extremality, black holes with zero angular momentum no longer emit\nindividual photons and gravitons; the dominant radiation channel consists of\nentangled pairs of photons in angular-momentum singlet states. We also compute\nthe effects of backreaction and metric fluctuations on the emission of charged\nparticles. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the semiclassical Schwinger\nemission rate is essentially unchanged despite the fact that the emission\nprocess leads to large changes in the geometry and thermodynamics of the\nthroat. We present, for the first time, the full history of the evaporation of\na large charged black hole. This corrects the semiclassical calculation, which\ngives completely wrong predictions for almost the entire evaporation history,\neven for the crudest observables like the temperature seen by a thermometer.",

Quasi-simultaneous multifrequency observations provide\ninsights into the physical conditions in compact regions and allow testing\naccretion theories. Initially we aimed at measuring the magnetic field strength\nclose to the central supermassive black hole in NRAO 530 (1730-130) by studying\nfrequency-dependent opacity of the jet matter, Faraday rotation and the\nspectral index in the mm-radio bands. NRAO 530 was observed\nquasi-simultaneously at 15, 22, 43, 86, and 227 GHz at four different very long\nbaseline interferometer (VLBI) networks. By the means of imaging and\nmodel-fitting, we aligned the images, taken at different frequencies. We\nexplored opacity along the jet and distribution of the linearly polarized\nemission in it. Our findings reveal that the jet of NRAO 530 at 86 and 227 GHz\nis transparent down to its origin, with 70 mJy emission detected at 227 GHz\npotentially originating from the accretion disk. The magnetic field strength\nnear the black hole, estimated at $5r_\\mathrm{g}$, is $3\\times10^3-3\\times10^4$\nG (depending on the central black hole mass). These values represent some of\nthe highest magnetic field strengths reported for active galaxies. We also\nreport the first ever VLBI measurement of the Faraday rotation at 43-227 GHz,\nwhich reveals rotation measure values as high as -48000 rad/m2 consistent with\nhigher particle density and stronger magnetic fields at the jet's outset. The\ncomplex shape of the jet in NRAO 530 is in line with the expected behavior of a\nprecessing jet, with a period estimated to be around $6\\pm4$~years.",

In this work, we investigate the\nintrinsic error threshold of the two-dimensional toric code, a paradigmatic\ntopological quantum memory, under these coherent noises by employing both\nanalytical and numerical methods based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism.\nA connection between the mixed-state phase of the decohered toric code and a\nnon-Hermitian Ashkin-Teller-type statistical mechanics model is established,\nand the mixed-state phase diagrams under the coherent noises are obtained.

We measure the excitation spectrum of confining strings\nwound around a spatial dimension of a size $R$. We do so for the $SU(N)$\nYang-Mills theory with $N=3,5,6$ and for two different values of the lattice\nspacing. We employ the generalized eigenvalue problem in combination with an\nextended basis of operators; this enables us to project onto all possible\nirreducible representations characterised by spin $|J_{\\rm modulo \\ 4}|$,\ntransverse parity $P_{\\perp}$, longitudinal parity $P_{\\parallel}$ as well as\nby longitudinal momentum $p_{\\parallel}=\\frac{2 \\pi q}{R}$, and extract\naccurate results for approximately $35$ lightest states. Applying the\nThermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) technique for calculating the finite volume\nspectrum, we confirm that the observed states are well described by the low\nenergy effective theory of a long string consisting of two translational\nGoldstone bosons (``phonons\"), along with a massive pseudoscalar (``the\nworldsheet axion\") coupled to phonons through a $\\theta$-term.

We provide a\nsimple derivation of the organization of spins into tensor degrees of freedom\ndescribing the multipole moments of a tetrahedron, whose components correspond\nto irreducible representations (irreps) of the tetrahedral symmetry group\n$T_d$. By parameterizing the Hamiltonian directly in terms of the energies of\nthe individual irreps, we perform an exhaustive search of all possible irrep\ndegeneracies which may host stable classical spin liquids. Doing so reveals\nfour one-parameter families of models along which three phases are degenerate,\nall four of which merge at the Heisenberg antiferromagnet and its dual, and we\ngive a complete three-dimensional picture of the phase diagram showing all of\nthe phases and their intersections. The appearance of two copies of a single\nirrep implies an extra degenerate locus which pierces the phase boundaries at\nspecial points, yielding two additional isolated triple points. We demonstrate\nthat one-parameter families of Hamiltonians are characterized by a topological\ninvariant describing how the ground state spin configuration winds when\nadiabatically transported around this degenerate locus, analogous to a\n\"diabolical locus\". We provide a comprehensive catalog of all flat band\ndegeneracies in the phase diagram and discuss the mechanisms that may allow for\nor impede the realization of a variety of classical spin liquids described by\ntensor gauge fields exhibiting pinch line singularities and concomitant\nfour-fold pinch points.

We examine the diversity of kinematic sub-structure present in the\nfirst 12 galaxies observed from the GECKOS survey, a VLT/MUSE large programme\nproviding a systematic study of 36 edge-on, Milky Way-mass disc galaxies.\nEmploying the nGIST analysis pipeline, we derive the mean line-of-sight stellar\nvelocity ($V_{\\star}$), velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_{\\star}$), skew ($h_{3}$),\nand kurtosis ($h_{4}$) for the sample, and examine 2D maps and 1D line\nprofiles. Visually, the majority of this sample (8/12) are found to possess\nboxy-peanut bulges and host the corresponding kinematic structure predicted for\nstellar bars viewed in projection. Four galaxies exhibit strong evidence for\nthe presence of nuclear discs, including central $h_{3}$-$V_{\\star}$ sign\nmismatch, `croissant'-shaped central depressions in $\\sigma_{\\star}$ maps,\nstrong gradients in $h_{3}$, and positive $h_{4}$ plateaus over the expected\nnuclear disc extent. The strength of the $h_{3}$ feature corresponds to the\nsize of the nuclear disc, measured from the $h_{3}$ turnover radius. We can\nexplain the features within the kinematic maps of all sample galaxies via disc\nstructure(s) alone. We do not find any need to invoke the existence of\ndispersion-dominated bulges.

We conclude that the variety of kinematic\nsub-structures seen in GECKOS galaxies requires a contemporary view of galaxy\nmorphology, expanding on the traditional view of galaxy structure, and uniting\nthe kinematic complexity observed in the Milky Way with the extragalactic.",

The physical\nproperties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties,\nbecause models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely.\nHere, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program,\nsupplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this \"V shape\".\nBy fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a\nlarge fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red\nH$\\alpha$ emitters at $2<z<6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all\nstrong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\\mu$m).\nUsing a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light\ncomponent, we demonstrate that the observed \"V shape\" in Little Red Dots is\nunlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is\ndominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an\nintrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by\nevolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed\nspectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently\nredward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little\nRed Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests\nthat it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the\nrest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated\nwith $T\\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at\nH$_\\infty$.",

We propose a new way to constrain the\nmerger remnant's NS lifetime, which is based on the tendency of the NS remnant\nneutrino-driven winds to enrich the ejected material with helium. Based on the\nHe I $\\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in\nAT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of\n$X_{\\mathrm{He}} \\gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Recent\nneutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with\nthis limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime\nimplies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\\mathrm{\\rm tot}$, lay close\nto the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse,\n$M_\\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\\mathrm{thres}}\\lesssim 2.93\nM_\\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the\nradii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously\nlarge values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this\nresult implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\\mathrm{max}\\lesssim2.3 M_\\odot$. The\ncombination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\\odot$ NSs to about\n12$\\pm$1 km for $M_\\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\\odot$ and 11.5$\\pm$1 km for\n$M_\\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\\odot$. This $\\sim2$ km allowable range then\ntightens significantly for $M_\\mathrm{max}$ above $\\approx2.15$ M$_\\odot$. This\nrules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime\nalso implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the\ncentral engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A.

    "abstract": "The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for\nunderstanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights\ninto the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this\nstudy, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic\nInformation Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between\nthe biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \\emph{information\narchitecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel\nmethodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems,\nincluding biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological\nobservations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To\noperationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World\nmodel tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets,\nformulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the\nco-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this\nExo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and\nenvironment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these\ncorrelations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the\ncoupled systems. This \\emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description\nof the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet.\nFinally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing\ndetailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new\navenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature\ncandidates.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, multimodal benchmarks for general domains have guided the\nrapid development of multimodal models on general tasks. However, the financial\nfield has its peculiarities. It features unique graphical images (e.g.,\ncandlestick charts, technical indicator charts) and possesses a wealth of\nspecialized financial knowledge (e.g., futures, turnover rate). Therefore,\nbenchmarks from general fields often fail to measure the performance of\nmultimodal models in the financial domain, and thus cannot effectively guide\nthe rapid development of large financial models. To promote the development of\nlarge financial multimodal models, we propose MME-Finance, an bilingual\nopen-ended and practical usage-oriented Visual Question Answering (VQA)\nbenchmark. The characteristics of our benchmark are finance and expertise,\nwhich include constructing charts that reflect the actual usage needs of users\n(e.g., computer screenshots and mobile photography), creating questions\naccording to the preferences in financial domain inquiries, and annotating\nquestions by experts with 10+ years of experience in the financial industry.\nAdditionally, we have developed a custom-designed financial evaluation system\nin which visual information is first introduced in the multi-modal evaluation\nprocess. Extensive experimental evaluations of 19 mainstream MLLMs are\nconducted to test their perception, reasoning, and cognition capabilities. The\nresults indicate that models performing well on general benchmarks cannot do\nwell on MME-Finance; for instance, the top-performing open-source and\nclosed-source models obtain 65.69 (Qwen2VL-72B) and 63.18 (GPT-4o),\nrespectively. Their performance is particularly poor in categories most\nrelevant to finance, such as candlestick charts and technical indicator charts.\nIn addition, we propose a Chinese version, which helps compare performance of\nMLLMs under a Chinese context.",

    "abstract": "One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended\npseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense\ninvestigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for\nunderstanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have\nbeen proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders\nsuch as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi\nliquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL*\nand OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi\nsurface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent\nexperimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between\nstripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario:\nan orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain\nwalls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the\nproliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the\nunderlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is\npreserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result,\nwell-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist,\nwhich couple to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall\nstring-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface.\nAt a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a\ntransition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP)\nfeaturing quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes\na deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases,\nand suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole)\ndoped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.",

A fully-developed\nturbulent airflow drives the growth of a narrowbanded wave field, whose\namplitude increases until reaching breaking conditions. The breaking events\nresult in a loss of wave energy, transferred to the water column, followed by\nrenewed growth under wind forcing. We revisit the momentum flux analysis in a\nhigh-wind speed regime, characterized by the ratio of the friction velocity to\nwave speed $u_\\ast/c$ in the range $[0.3-0.9]$, through the lens of\ngrowing-breaking cycles. The total momentum flux across the interface is\ndominated by pressure, which increases with $u_\\ast/c$ during growth and\nreduces sharply during breaking. Drag reduction during breaking is linked to\nairflow separation, a sudden acceleration of the flow, an upward shift of the\nmean streamwise velocity profile, and a reduction in Reynolds shear stress. We\ncharacterize the reduction of pressure stress and flow acceleration through an\naerodynamic drag coefficient by splitting the analysis between growing and\nbreaking stages, treating them as separate sub-processes. While drag increases\nwith $u_\\ast/c$ during growth, it drops during breaking.

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across\nvarious visual understanding and reasoning tasks, driven by incorporating image\nrepresentations into the token inputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,\ntheir real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during\ninference due to the substantial compute required by the LLM to process the\nlarge number of input tokens, predominantly arising from the image. To reduce\ninference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input\ntokens needed to represent the image, the latter of which has been the focus of\nmany recent efforts around token compression. However, it is unclear what the\noptimal trade-off is given a fixed inference budget. We first characterize this\noptimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by\nestablishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two\nfactors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the\ninference-optimal behavior in VLMs is achieved by using the largest LLM that\nfits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to\na single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on\nmaintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g.,\n$5-10\\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime\nrequires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these\ninsights, we take the first steps toward designing token compression algorithms\ntailored for high-compression settings, utilizing prompt-based compression of\ntokens. Our work underscores the performance and efficiency benefits of\noperating in low visual token regimes and the importance of developing tailored\ntoken reduction algorithms for such conditions.

    "abstract": "Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with\nimage-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced\ncontrollability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However,\ndespite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image\nprompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these\nprompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of\nover 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for\nImage-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated\nvideos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining\nthe time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset.\nNext, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM\n(text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in\nboth basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in\nimage-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers\ncan use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the\nmulti-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model\nsafety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by\nimage-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences\nwith existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video\nprompt dataset.

We prove well-posedness\nof the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master\nequation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how\nultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without\nincreasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two\nscenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics\ninfluenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe\nanomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slow down during cooling, with\nlasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the\nprotein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent transition rates to\nsimulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our\nresults capture a \"whiplash\" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds\nand then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one)\nin response to temperature changes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness\nof $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex\nsystems with dynamic transition rate, providing analytical solutions that\nimprove our understanding of relaxation processes in material and biological\nsystems.",

While several\narchitectures have been proposed within the commonly employed\ngrounding-by-selection framework, the utilized losses are comparatively\nunder-explored. In particular, most methods rely on a basic supervised\ncross-entropy loss on the predicted distribution over candidate instances,\nwhich fails to model both spatial relations between instances and the internal\nfine-grained word-level structure of the verbal referral. Sparse attempts to\nadditionally supervise verbal embeddings globally by learning the class of the\nreferred instance from the description or employing verbo-visual contrast to\nbetter separate instance embeddings do not fundamentally lift the\naforementioned limitations. Responding to these shortcomings, we introduce two\nnovel losses for 3D visual grounding: a visual-level offset loss on regressed\nvector offsets from each instance to the ground-truth referred instance and a\nlanguage-related span loss on predictions for the word-level span of the\nreferred instance in the description. In addition, we equip the verbo-visual\nfusion module of our new 3D visual grounding architecture AsphaltNet with a\ntop-down bidirectional attentive fusion block, which enables the supervisory\nsignals from our two losses to propagate to the respective converse branches of\nthe network and thus aid the latter to learn context-aware instance embeddings\nand grounding-aware verbal embeddings.

    "abstract": "An amplitude analysis of the $D_{s1}(2460)^+\\to D_{s}^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$\ntransition is performed simultaneously in $B^{0}\\to\nD^{-}D_{s}^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$, $B^{+}\\to{\\bar{D}}^{0} D_{s}^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$,\nand $B^{0}\\to D^{*-}D_{s}^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ decays. The study is based on a\ndata sample of proton-proton collisions recorded with the LHCb detector at\ncentre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=7,8,$ and $13\\,$TeV, corresponding to a\ntotal integrated luminosity of $9\\,\\rm{fb}^{-1}$. A clear double-peak structure\nis observed in the $m(\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-})$ spectrum of the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+}\\to\nD_{s}^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ decay. The data can be described either with a model\nincluding $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $f_2(1270)$ resonances, in which the\ncontributions of $f_0(980)$ and $f_2(1270)$ are unexpectedly large, or with a\nmodel including $f_0(500)$, a doubly charged open-charm tetraquark state\n$T_{c\\bar{s}}^{++}$ and its isospin partner $T_{c\\bar{s}}^{0}$. If the former\nis considered implausible, the $T_{c\\bar{s}}$ states are observed with high\nsignificance, and the data are consistent with isospin symmetry. When imposing\nisospin constraints between the two $T_{c\\bar{s}}$ states, their mass and width\nare determined to be $2327\\pm13\\pm13\\,$MeV and $96\\pm16\\,^{+170}_{-23}\\,$MeV,\nrespectively, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is\nsystematic. The mass is slightly below the $DK$ threshold, and a spin-parity of\n$0^+$ is favoured with high significance.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic programming (DP) based algorithms are essential yet compute-intensive\nparts of numerous bioinformatics pipelines, which typically involve populating\na 2-D scoring matrix based on a recursive formula, optionally followed by a\ntraceback step to get the optimal alignment path. DP algorithms are used in a\nwide spectrum of bioinformatics tasks, including read assembly, homology\nsearch, gene annotation, basecalling, and phylogenetic inference. So far,\nspecialized hardware like ASICs and FPGAs have provided massive speedup for\nthese algorithms. However, these solutions usually represent a single design\npoint in the DP algorithmic space and typically require months of manual effort\nto implement using low-level hardware description languages (HDLs). This paper\nintroduces DP-HLS, a novel framework based on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) that\nsimplifies and accelerates the development of a broad set of bioinformatically\nrelevant DP algorithms in hardware. DP-HLS features an easy-to-use template\nwith integrated HLS directives, enabling efficient hardware solutions without\nrequiring hardware design knowledge. In our experience, DP-HLS significantly\nreduced the development time of new kernels (months to days) and produced\ndesigns with comparable resource utilization to open-source hand-coded\nHDL-based implementations and performance within 7.7-16.8% margin. DP-HLS is\ncompatible with AWS EC2 F1 FPGA instances. To demonstrate the versatility of\nthe DP-HLS framework, we implemented 15 diverse DP kernels, achieving 1.3-32x\nimproved throughput over state-of-the-art GPU and CPU baselines and providing\nthe first open-source FPGA implementation for several of them. The DP-HLS\ncodebase is available freely under the MIT license and its detailed wiki is\navailable to assist new users.",

In this framework, the effect of complex vacuum expectation values\nof the Higgs doublets on the fermion masses is explored and, under certain\nassumptions on the Yukawa couplings, we find that the neutrino mixing is\ncontrolled by the Cobimaximal pattern, but a sizeable deviation from the\ncharged lepton sector breaks the well known predictions on the atmospheric\nangle ($45^{\\circ}$) and the Dirac CP-violating phase ($-90^{\\circ}$). In\naddition, due to the presence of heavy neutrinos at the $TeV$ scale, charged\nlepton flavor violation (CLFV) and neutrinoless double beta decay get notable\ncontributions. Analytical formulae for these observables are obtained, and then\na numerical calculation allows to fit quite well the lepton mixing for the\nnormal and inverted hierarchies, however, the branching ratios decay values for\nCLFV disfavors the latter one. Along with this, the region of parameter space\nfor the $m_{ee}$ effective neutrino mass lies below the GERDA bounds for both\nthe normal and inverted hierarchies.

However, to\nmake reliable inferences, medical practitioners require not only estimating\naveraged causal quantities, such as the conditional average treatment effect,\nbut also understanding the randomness of the treatment effect as a random\nvariable. This randomness is referred to as aleatoric uncertainty and is\nnecessary for understanding the probability of benefit from treatment or\nquantiles of the treatment effect. Yet, the aleatoric uncertainty of the\ntreatment effect has received surprisingly little attention in the causal\nmachine learning community. To fill this gap, we aim to quantify the aleatoric\nuncertainty of the treatment effect at the covariate-conditional level, namely,\nthe conditional distribution of the treatment effect (CDTE). Unlike average\ncausal quantities, the CDTE is not point identifiable without strong additional\nassumptions. As a remedy, we employ partial identification to obtain sharp\nbounds on the CDTE and thereby quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the\ntreatment effect. We then develop a novel, orthogonal learner for the bounds on\nthe CDTE, which we call AU-learner. We further show that our AU-learner has\nseveral strengths in that it satisfies Neyman-orthogonality and, thus,\nquasi-oracle efficiency.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that to establish the almost everywhere convergence of a\nsequence of operators on $L_1$-space, it is sufficient to obtain a weak\n$(1,1)$-type inequality for the maximal operator corresponding to the sequence\nof operators. However, in practical applications, the establishment of the\nmentioned inequality for the maximal operators is very tricky and difficult\njob. In the present paper, the main aim is a novel outlook at above mentioned\ninequality for the tensor product of two weighted one-dimensional Walsh-Fourier\nseries. Namely, our main idea is naturally to consider uniformly boundedness\nconditions for the sequences which imply the weak type estimation for the\nmaximal operator of the tensor product. More precisely, we are going to\nestablish weak type of inequality for the tensor product of two dimensional\nmaximal operators while having the uniform boundedness of the corresponding one\ndimensional operators. Moreover, the convergence of the tensor product of\noperators is established at the two dimensional Walsh-Lebesgue points.",

At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states\noffer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly\nfew quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere\ncomputational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with\nquantum one-time tokens.\n  A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to\nbe evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the\ntoken cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a\nscheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical\nprogram, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies\nan interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the\nclassical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model.\n  Importantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be\nimplemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity\nof the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected,\nand additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the\nprotocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that\nour proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a\nnear-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early\nfault tolerant regime.",

The Knockoff filter has been recently proposed in\nthe frequentist paradigm to introduce controlled noise in a model by cleverly\nconstructing copies of the predictors as auxiliary variables. In this paper, we\ndevelop a fully Bayesian generalization of the classical model-X knockoff\nfilter for normally distributed covariates. In our approach we consider a joint\nmodel of the covariates and the response variables, and incorporate the\nconditional independence structure of the covariates into the prior\ndistribution of the auxiliary knockoff variables. We further incorporate the\nestimation of a graphical model among the covariates,leading to improved\nknockoffs generation and estimation of the covariate effects on the response.\nWe use a modified spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients, which\navoids the increase of the model dimension as typical in the classical knockoff\nfilter. Our model performs variable selection using an upper bound on the\nposterior probability of non-inclusion. We show how our construction leads to\nvalid model-X knockoffs and demonstrate that the proposed variable selection\nprocedure leads to controlling the Bayesian FDR at an arbitrary level, in\nfinite samples, if the distribution of the covariates is fully known, and\nasymptotically if estimated as in the proposed model. We use simulated data to\ndemonstrate that our proposal increases the stability of the selection with\nrespect to classical knockoff methods. With respect to Bayesian variable\nselection methods, we show that our selection procedure achieves comparable or\nbetter performances, while maintaining control over the FDR. Finally, we show\nthe usefulness of the proposed model with an application to real data.",

Quadrotors are capable of fast and\nagile flight in cluttered environments when piloted manually, but vision-based\nautonomous flight in unknown environments is difficult in part due to the\nsensor limitations of traditional onboard cameras. Event cameras, however,\npromise nearly zero motion blur and high dynamic range, but produce a very\nlarge volume of events under significant ego-motion and further lack a\ncontinuous-time sensor model in simulation, making direct sim-to-real transfer\nnot possible. By leveraging depth prediction as a pretext task in our learning\nframework, we can pre-train a reactive obstacle avoidance events-to-control\npolicy with approximated, simulated events and then fine-tune the perception\ncomponent with limited events-and-depth real-world data to achieve obstacle\navoidance in indoor and outdoor settings. We demonstrate this across two\nquadrotor-event camera platforms in multiple settings and find, contrary to\ntraditional vision-based works, that low speeds (1m/s) make the task harder and\nmore prone to collisions, while high speeds (5m/s) result in better event-based\ndepth estimation and avoidance.

Due to having\nmore logical degrees of freedom in the codes, there is a richer structure of\nattainable logical gates compared to those for topological codes. To illustrate\nthe scheme, we focus on families of hypergraph and balanced product codes that\nscale as $[[18q^2,8,2q]]_{q\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and $[[18q,8,\\leq 2q]]_{q\\in\n\\mathbb{N}}$ respectively. For distance 6 to 12 hypergraph product codes, we\nfind that the set of twists and fold-transversal gates generate the full\nlogical Clifford group. For the balanced product code, we show that Dehn twists\napply to codes in this family with odd $q$. We also show that the $[[90,8,10]]$\nbivariate bicycle code is a member of the balanced product code family that\nsaturates the distance bound. We also find balanced product codes that saturate\nthe bound up to $q\\leq8$ through a numerical search.",

For a single ion sitting in the centre of\nthe lattice we observe a state-dependent trap-frequency shift of $2\\pi\\times\n3.33(4)$ kHz, corresponding to a bare optical potential of $2\\pi\\times 76.8(5)$\nkHz for the electronic ground state.

    "abstract": "Accurate stabilization of facial motion is essential for applications in\nphotoreal avatar construction for 3D games, virtual reality, movies, and\ntraining data collection. For the latter, stabilization must work automatically\nfor the general population with people of varying morphology. Distinguishing\nrigid skull motion from facial expressions is critical since misalignment\nbetween skull motion and facial expressions can lead to animation models that\nare hard to control and can not fit natural motion. Existing methods struggle\nto work with sparse sets of very different expressions, such as when combining\nmultiple units from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Certain approaches\nare not robust enough, some depend on motion data to find stable points, while\nothers make one-for-all invalid physiological assumptions. In this paper, we\nleverage recent advances in neural signed distance fields and differentiable\nisosurface meshing to compute skull stabilization rigid transforms directly on\nunstructured triangle meshes or point clouds, significantly enhancing accuracy\nand robustness. We introduce the concept of a stable hull as the surface of the\nboolean intersection of stabilized scans, analogous to the visual hull in\nshape-from-silhouette and the photo hull from space carving. This hull\nresembles a skull overlaid with minimal soft tissue thickness, upper teeth are\nautomatically included. Our skull carving algorithm simultaneously optimizes\nthe stable hull shape and rigid transforms to get accurate stabilization of\ncomplex expressions for large diverse sets of people, outperforming existing\nmethods.",

In this paper, we give the first general treatment of privacy against\n$\\textit{adaptive}$ adversaries for mechanisms that support dataset updates and\na variety of queries, all arbitrarily interleaved. It also models a very\ngeneral notion of neighboring, that includes both event-level and user-level\nprivacy.\n  We prove several $\\textit{concurrent}$ composition theorems for continual\nmechanisms, which ensure privacy even when an adversary can interleave queries\nand dataset updates to the different composed mechanisms. Previous concurrent\ncomposition theorems for differential privacy were only for the case when the\ndataset is static, with no adaptive updates. Moreover, we also give the first\ninteractive and continual generalizations of the \"parallel composition theorem\"\nfor noninteractive differential privacy. Specifically, we show that the\nanalogue of the noninteractive parallel composition theorem holds if either\nthere are no adaptive dataset updates or each of the composed mechanisms\nsatisfies pure differential privacy, but it fails to hold for composing\napproximately differentially private mechanisms with dataset updates.\n  We then formalize a set of general conditions on a continual mechanism $M$\nthat runs multiple continual sub-mechanisms such that the privacy guarantees of\n$M$ follow directly using the above concurrent composition theorems on the\nsub-mechanisms, without further privacy loss. This enables us to give a simpler\nand more modular privacy analysis of a recent continual histogram mechanism of\nHenzinger, Sricharan, and Steiner.

While the LLM was more likely to\nprioritize politeness and balance among contrasting viewpoints when evaluating\nconstructiveness, participants emphasized logic and facts more than the LLM\ndid. Despite these differences, participants rated both LLM-generated and\nhuman-AI co-written comments as significantly more constructive than those\nwritten independently by humans. Our analysis also revealed that LLM-generated\ncomments integrated significantly more linguistic features of constructiveness\ncompared to human-written comments. When participants used LLMs to refine their\ncomments, the resulting comments were more constructive, more positive, less\ntoxic, and retained the original intent.

    "abstract": "The potential use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare robotics can\nhelp address the significant demand put on healthcare systems around the world\nwith respect to an aging demographic and a shortage of healthcare\nprofessionals. Even though LLMs have already been integrated into medicine to\nassist both clinicians and patients, the integration of LLMs within healthcare\nrobots has not yet been explored for clinical settings. In this perspective\npaper, we investigate the groundbreaking developments in robotics and LLMs to\nuniquely identify the needed system requirements for designing health specific\nLLM based robots in terms of multi modal communication through human robot\ninteractions (HRIs), semantic reasoning, and task planning. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the ethical issues, open challenges, and potential future research\ndirections for this emerging innovative field.",

Compared to UNet,\nDiffusion Transformers (DiT) demonstrate superior capabilities to effectively\ncapture the long-range dependencies among patches, leading to higher-quality\nimage generation. In this paper, we propose DiT4Edit, the first Diffusion\nTransformer-based image editing framework. Specifically, DiT4Edit uses the\nDPM-Solver inversion algorithm to obtain the inverted latents, reducing the\nnumber of steps compared to the DDIM inversion algorithm commonly used in\nUNet-based frameworks. Additionally, we design unified attention control and\npatches merging, tailored for transformer computation streams. This integration\nallows our framework to generate higher-quality edited images faster. Our\ndesign leverages the advantages of DiT, enabling it to surpass UNet structures\nin image editing, especially in high-resolution and arbitrary-size images.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of DiT4Edit across\nvarious editing scenarios, highlighting the potential of Diffusion Transformers\nin supporting image editing.",

To address these challenges, we draw\ninspiration from the sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoE) and propose a sparse\nmixture-of-agents (SMoA) framework to improve the efficiency and diversity of\nmulti-agent LLMs. Unlike completely connected structures, SMoA introduces novel\nResponse Selection and Early Stopping mechanisms to sparsify information flows\namong individual LLM agents, striking a balance between performance and\nefficiency. Additionally, inspired by the expert diversity principle in SMoE\nframeworks for workload balance between experts, we assign distinct role\ndescriptions to each LLM agent, fostering diverse and divergent thinking.\nExtensive experiments on reasoning, alignment, and fairness benchmarks\ndemonstrate that SMoA achieves performance comparable to traditional\nmixture-of-agents approaches but with significantly lower computational costs.\nFurther analysis reveals that SMoA is more stable, has a greater capacity to\nscale, and offers considerable potential through hyper-parameter optimization.\nCode and data will be available at: https://github.com/David-Li0406/SMoA.",

A recent result of Goldwasser, Kim, Vaikuntanathan, and Zamir (2022)\nshows that an adversary can plant undetectable backdoors in machine learning\nmodels, allowing the adversary to covertly control the model's behavior.\nBackdoors can be planted in such a way that the backdoored machine learning\nmodel is computationally indistinguishable from an honest model without\nbackdoors.\n  In this paper, we present strategies for defending against backdoors in ML\nmodels, even if they are undetectable. The key observation is that it is\nsometimes possible to provably mitigate or even remove backdoors without\nneeding to detect them, using techniques inspired by the notion of random\nself-reducibility. This depends on properties of the ground-truth labels\n(chosen by nature), and not of the proposed ML model (which may be chosen by an\nattacker).\n  We give formal definitions for secure backdoor mitigation, and proceed to\nshow two types of results. First, we show a \"global mitigation\" technique,\nwhich removes all backdoors from a machine learning model under the assumption\nthat the ground-truth labels are close to a Fourier-heavy function. Second, we\nconsider distributions where the ground-truth labels are close to a linear or\npolynomial function in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, we show \"local mitigation\"\ntechniques, which remove backdoors with high probability for every inputs of\ninterest, and are computationally cheaper than global mitigation. All of our\nconstructions are black-box, so our techniques work without needing access to\nthe model's representation (i.e., its code or parameters). Along the way we\nprove a simple result for robust mean estimation.",

We investigate a bias in such constraints: the\nmeasured column density (along the line of sight, using gravitational lensing)\nis lower than that experienced by a dark matter particle, as follows. Dark\nmatter halos are triaxial and generally collide along their major axes,\nyielding a high scattering column density -- but the merger is obvious only to\nobservers whose line of sight is nearly perpendicular to that axis, yielding a\nlow observed column density. We trace lines of sight through merging halos from\nthe BigMDPL n-body simulation, both with and without mock observational\neffects. We find that a hypothetical skewer through the center of the halo\nalong the merger axis (more precisely, along the current separation vector of\nthe two halos) has nearly twice the column density of a typical line of sight.\nWith weak lensing measurements, which involve some spatial averaging, this\nratio is reduced to 1.25, suggesting that existing constraints on the\nscattering cross section are biased high by about 25%.",

Existing attribution methods based on actual\ncausality and Shapley values tend to disproportionately blame agents who\ncontribute more to an outcome and rely on real-world measures of\nblameworthiness that may misalign with responsible AI standards. This paper\npresents a causal framework using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to\nsystematically attribute responsibility in human-AI systems, measuring overall\nblameworthiness while employing counterfactual reasoning to account for agents'\nexpected epistemic levels.

    "abstract": "The literature on word-representable graphs is quite rich, and a number of\nvariations of the original definition have been proposed over the years. We are\ninitiating a systematic study of such variations based on formal languages. In\nour framework, we can associate a graph class to each language over the binary\nalphabet \\{0,1\\}. All graph classes that are language-representable in this\nsense are hereditary and enjoy further common properties. Besides\nword-representable graphs and, more generally, 1^k- or k-11-representable\ngraphs, we can identify many more graph classes in our framework, like\n(co)bipartite graphs, (co)comparability graphs, to name a few. It was already\nknown that any graph is 111- or 2-11-representable. When such representations\nare considered for storing graphs, 111- or 2-11-representability bears the\ndisadvantage of being significantly inferior to standard adjacency matrices or\nlists. We prove that quite famous languages like the palindromes, the copy\nlanguage or the Lyndon words can match the efficiency of standard graph\nrepresentations. The perspective of language theory allows us to prove general\nresults that hold for all graph classes that can be defined in this way. This\nincludes certain closure properties (e.g., all language-definable graph classes\nare hereditary) as well as certain limitations (e.g., all\nlanguage-representable graph classes contain graphs of arbitrarily large\ntreewidth and of arbitrarily large degeneracy, except a trivial case). As each\nlanguage describes a graph class, we can also ask decidability questions\nconcerning graph classes, given a concrete presentation of a formal language.\nWe also present a systematic study of graph classes that can be represented by\nlanguages in which each letter occurs at most twice. Here, we find graph\nclasses like interval, permutation, circle, bipartite chain, convex, and\nthreshold graphs.",

AT2024wpp rose to a peak brightness of c=-21.9mag in\n4.3d and remained above the half-maximum brightness for only 6.7d. The\nblackbody fits to the multi-band photometry show that the event remained\npersistently hot (T>20000K) with a rapidly receding photosphere (v~11500km/s)\nuntil the end of the photometric dataset at +16.1d post-discovery. This\nbehaviour mimics that of AT2018cow, albeit with a several times larger\nphotosphere. The spectra are consistent with blackbody emission throughout our\nspectral sequence ending at +21.9d, showing a tentative, very broad emission\nfeature at 5500{\\AA} -- implying that the optical photosphere is likely within\na near-relativistic outflow. Furthermore, reports of strong X-ray and radio\nemission cement the nature of AT2024wpp as a likely Cow-like transient.\nAT2024wpp is only the second event of the class with optical polarimetry. Our\nBVRI observations obtained from +6.1 to +14.4d show a low polarisation of\nP<0.5% across all bands, similar to AT2018cow that was consistent with P~0%\nduring the same outflow-driven phase. In the absence of evidence for a\npreferential viewing angle, it is unlikely that both events would have shown\nlow polarisation in the case that their photospheres were aspherical. As such,\nwe conclude that the near-relativistic outflows launched in these events are\nlikely highly spherical, but polarimetric observations of further events are\ncrucial to constrain their ejecta geometry and stratification in detail.",

Despite extensive prior work to reduce red light\nviolations, they continue to be a major problem in practice, partly because\nexisting systems suffer from the flaw of providing the same guidance to all\ndrivers. As a result, some violations are avoided, but other drivers ignore or\nrespond inappropriately to red light running systems, resulting in safety\nissues overall. We show a method of providing accurate warnings to individual\ndrivers to avoid the broad guidance approach of most existing systems.\nRecognizing if a driver will run red lights is highly dependent on signal phase\nand timing, traffic conditions along the road, and individual driver behaviour,\nthe proposed warning system contains three parts: a traffic prediction\nalgorithm, an individual warning signal optimizer, and a driver warning\ndisplay. The traffic prediction algorithm predicts future traffic states along\nthe road towards the signalized intersections using the latest traffic\nconditions obtained through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure\ncommunications. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to compute the\noptimal warning signal based on predicted traffic states and driver reaction\nmodel. Finally, the optimal warning signal is shown on the display screen to\nadvise driver on how much braking is needed to avoid running the red light. The\nsystem continuously updates the latest warning signal as the vehicle is\napproaching the intersection. Both numerical simulated driving scenarios and\nreal-world road tests are used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's\nperformance under different conditions by comparing with previous work on red\nlight running warning system. The results show that the system provides more\neffective and accurate warning signals to drivers, helping them avoid running\nred lights.",

For example, workers do not always have strict preferences over jobs,\nstudents can give the same ranking for different schools and more. In\nparticular, assume w.l.o.g. that workers' preferences are determined by their\nutility from being matched to each job, which might admit ties. Notably, in\ncontrast to classical two-sided markets with strict preferences, there is no\nlonger a single stable matching that simultaneously maximizes the utility for\nall workers.\n  We aim to guarantee each worker the largest possible share from the utility\nin her best possible stable matching. We call the ratio between the worker's\nbest possible stable utility and its assigned utility the \\emph{Optimal Stable\nShare} (OSS)-ratio. We first prove that distributions over stable matchings\ncannot guarantee an OSS-ratio that is sublinear in the number of workers.\nInstead, randomizing over possibly non-stable matchings, we show how to achieve\na tight logarithmic OSS-ratio. Then, we analyze the case where the real utility\nis not necessarily known and can only be approximated. In particular, we\nprovide an algorithm that guarantees a similar fraction of the utility compared\nto the best possible utility. Finally, we move to a bandit setting, where we\nselect a matching at each round and only observe the utilities for matches we\nperform. We show how to utilize our results for approximate utilities to\ngracefully interpolate between problems without ties and problems with\nstatistical ties (small suboptimality gaps).",

Device identification (DI), which\ndistinguishes IoT devices based on their traffic patterns, plays a crucial role\nin both differentiating devices and identifying vulnerable ones, closing a\nserious security gap. However, existing approaches to DI that build machine\nlearning models often overlook the challenge of model generalizability across\ndiverse network environments. In this study, we propose a novel framework to\naddress this limitation and to evaluate the generalizability of DI models\nacross data sets collected within different network environments. Our approach\ninvolves a two-step process: first, we develop a feature and model selection\nmethod that is more robust to generalization issues by using a genetic\nalgorithm with external feedback and datasets from distinct environments to\nrefine the selections. Second, the resulting DI models are then tested on\nfurther independent datasets to robustly assess their generalizability. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method by empirically comparing it to\nalternatives, highlighting how fundamental limitations of commonly employed\ntechniques such as sliding window and flow statistics limit their\ngeneralizability. Moreover, we show that statistical methods, widely used in\nthe literature, are unreliable for device identification due to their\ndependence on network-specific characteristics rather than device-intrinsic\nproperties, challenging the validity of a significant portion of existing\nresearch. Our findings advance research in IoT security and device\nidentification, offering insight into improving model effectiveness and\nmitigating risks in IoT networks.",

    "abstract": "Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging\nprior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't,\nbetween different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying\nand refining this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target\n(prediction) data. A challenging open problem is addressing the empirical\nphenomenon of negative transfer, whereby the transfer learner performs worse on\nthe target data after taking the source data into account than before. We first\nintroduce a Bayesian perspective on negative transfer, and then a method to\naddress it. The key insight from our formulation is that negative transfer can\nstem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable causes of the\nsource data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for\nprobabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of\nthe source data (the data sources may be \"unknown\"). PROMPT is thus applicable\nwhen differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of\nlatent confounders. Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations\nin the target task (may not have the ability to \"fine-tune\"), and instead makes\nuse of proxy (indirect) information. Our theoretical results show that the\nthreat of negative transfer does not depend on the informativeness of the proxy\ninformation, highlighting the usefulness of PROMPT in cases where only noisy\nindirect information, such as human feedback, is available.",

    "abstract": "Image shadow removal is a typical low-level vision task. Shadows cause local\nbrightness shifts, which reduce the performance of downstream vision tasks.\nCurrently, Transformer-based shadow removal methods suffer from quadratic\ncomputational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism. To improve\nefficiency, many approaches use local attention, but this limits the ability to\nmodel global information and weakens the perception of brightness changes\nbetween regions. Recently, Mamba has shown strong performance in vision tasks\nby enabling global modeling with linear complexity. However, existing scanning\nstrategies are not suitable for shadow removal, as they ignore the semantic\ncontinuity of shadow boundaries and internal regions. To address this, this\npaper proposes a boundary-region selective scanning mechanism that captures\nlocal details while enhancing semantic continuity between them, effectively\nimproving shadow removal performance. In addition, a shadow mask denoising\nmethod is introduced to support the scanning mechanism and improve data\nquality. Based on these techniques, this paper presents a model called\nShadowMamba, the first Mamba-based model designed for shadow removal.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing\nmainstream approaches on the AISTD, ISTD, and SRD datasets, and also offers\nclear advantages in parameter efficiency and computational complexity.

This\nlast condition applies to many nonlocal games of interest, including all XOR\ngames, synchronous games, and boolean constrained system (BCS) games.\n  For those nonlocal games with robust game algebras, we prove that\nself-testing is equivalent to the uniqueness of finite-dimensional tracial\nstates on the associated game algebra, and robust self-testing is equivalent to\nthe uniqueness of amenable tracial states. Applying this tracial-state\ncharacterization of self-testing to parallel repetition, we show that a\nsynchronous game is a self-test for perfect quantum strategies if and only if\nits parallel repeated version is a self-test for perfect quantum strategies.\n  As a proof approach, we give the first quantitative Gower-Hatami theorem that\nis applicable to C*-algebras.

In the Rubin Observatory era, the scale of\noperations will increase tenfold compared to its precursor, the Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF), requiring improvements in classification purity, data\ncompression for informative alerts, and pipeline speed.\n  We explore the use of the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on difference\nimages as a tool to enhance machine learning models for satellite detection.\nUsing the ALeRCE single-stamp classifier as a baseline, we adapt its\narchitecture to incorporate a cutout of the FFT of the difference image\nalongside the standard ZTF image triplet (science, reference, and difference\nstamps). We evaluate several stamp sizes and resolutions, focusing on regimes\nwhere data compression is critical due to alert size limits and real-time\nconstraints.\n  Incorporating the FFT significantly improves satellite classification,\nespecially in the smallest field-of-view model (16 arcsec), where accuracy\nincreases from 72.0\\pm2.9% to 87.8\\pm1.3%.

    "abstract": "Permanent magnet array (PMA) is a popular option to provide the main magnetic\nfield in a dedicated portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system because\nit does not need power or a cooling system and has a much stronger field\nstrength compared to a resistive magnet. Aside from the popular Halbach array\nthat has a transversal field direction, the Inward-Outward ring (IO ring) array\nis a promising candidate that offers a longitudinal field direction with\nvarious design and engineering possibilities. In this article, a thorough study\nof IO ring arrays is conducted by examining the relation between the design\nparameters and its field patterns, its variants that lead to different\napplications and their properties. A detailed comparison between an IO ring\narray and Halbach array was conducted and reported. Moreover, the feasibility\nof building an IO ring array in a lab is demonstrated. The investigations\nstrongly indicate that IO ring is a promising candidate that can offer high and\nhomogeneous fields or a desired field pattern to portable MRI systems. With a\nlongitudinal field direction, an IO ring array opens up opportunities to adopt\nMRI advanced technology and techniques in a portable system to improve image\nquality and shorten scan time.",

The main goal of this paper is\nto understand the role of these constraints in min-max optimization. The first\ncontribution of this paper is a fundamentally new proof of their main result,\nwhich improves it in multiple directions: it holds for degree 2 polynomials, it\nis essentially tight in the parameters, and it is much simpler than previous\napproaches, clearly highlighting the role of constraints in the hardness of the\nproblem. Second, we show that with general constraints (i.e., the min player\nand max player have different constraints), even convex-concave min-max\noptimization becomes PPAD-hard.

This multifaceted challenge involves the\ninterplay of various disciplines, each with distinct parameters and\nconstraints. Traditional design approaches often fall short, necessitating\nadvanced methodologies like Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO).

The work highlights the challenge of optimising aircraft\ndesigns using multiple models of varying fidelity.

Instead,\nconcurrent optimisation schemes are explored, utilising both low-fidelity\n(beam-based) and high-fidelity (shell-based) models. This approach promises\nstructural feasibility, reduces computational costs, and incorporates\nhigh-fidelity information early in the design process.

By prior work, such a separation was known only for an\nartificial graph problem with an inherently global definition [Le Gall et al.\n2019]. We present a problem that we call iterated GHZ, which is defined using\nonly local constraints. Formally, it is a family of locally checkable labeling\nproblems [Naor and Stockmeyer 1995]; in particular, solutions can be verified\nwith a constant-round distributed algorithm. We show that in graphs of maximum\ndegree $\\Delta$, any classical (deterministic or randomized) LOCAL model\nalgorithm will require $\\Omega(\\Delta)$ rounds to solve the iterated GHZ\nproblem, while the problem can be solved in $1$ round in quantum-LOCAL. We use\nthe round elimination technique to prove that the iterated GHZ problem requires\n$\\Omega(\\Delta)$ rounds for classical algorithms. This is the first work that\nshows that round elimination is indeed able to separate the two models, and\nthis also demonstrates that round elimination cannot be used to prove lower\nbounds for quantum-LOCAL. To apply round elimination, we introduce a new\ntechnique that allows us to discover appropriate problem relaxations in a\nmechanical way; it turns out that this new technique extends beyond the scope\nof the iterated GHZ problem and can be used to e.g. reproduce prior results on\nmaximal matchings [FOCS 2019, PODC 2020] in a systematic manner.",

First, bit-depth compression produces\na uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the\nrecovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise\nreduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed\ngeometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution\nthat decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling\nglobal and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose\nthe fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine\ngeometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while\nsimultaneously enriching them with complementary information from\nlow-resolution context-level image features.

The analysis is based on the assumption that observers apply principles\nof optimism or pessimism about theory building in a coherent way. On this\nbasis, we provide a rough assessment of the current range of plausible\ncredences in low energy SUSY and determine in which way LHC data changes those\ncredences. For observers who had been optimistic about low energy SUSY before\nthe LHC, the method reports that LHC data does lead to decreased credences in\naccordance with intuition. The decrease is moderate, however, and keeps\nposteriors at very substantial levels. The analysis further establishes that a\nvery high but not yet indefensible degree of pessimism regarding the success\nchances of theory building still results in quite significant credences in GUT\nand low energy SUSY for the time right before the start of the LHC.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns\nassociated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized,\ncollaborative learning. However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats,\nincluding poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training\ndata or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this\nthreat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract\npoisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods\npredominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the\nunique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present\nFLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated\nlearning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client\ndata and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional\nmodel-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client\ntrustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns,\nrather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach\nextracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers\nglobal properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal\nlogic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution,\nidentifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results\non two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared\nto existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the\nrobustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the\nprediction error by 93.27% in the best-case scenario compared to the\nsecond-best baseline.

This problem was\nintroduced by [Bhattacharjee, Dexter, Drineas, Musco, Ray '22], where it was\nshown that one can obtain an $\\epsilon n$ additive approximation to all\neigenvalues of $A$ by sampling a principal submatrix of dimension\n$\\frac{\\text{poly}(\\log n)}{\\epsilon^3}$. We improve their analysis by showing\nthat it suffices to sample a principal submatrix of dimension\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$ (with no dependence on $n$). This matches\nknown lower bounds and therefore resolves the sample complexity of this problem\nup to $\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ factors. Using similar techniques, we give a\ntight $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$ bound for obtaining an additive\n$\\epsilon\\|A\\|_F$ approximation to the spectrum of $A$ via squared row-norm\nsampling, improving on the previous best $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{8}})$\nbound. We also address the problem of approximating the top eigenvector for a\nbounded entry, PSD matrix $A.$ In particular, we show that sampling\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ columns of $A$ suffices to produce a unit vector $u$\nwith $u^T A u \\geq \\lambda_1(A) - \\epsilon n$. This matches what one could\nachieve via the sampling bound of [Musco, Musco'17] for the special case of\napproximating the top eigenvector, but does not require adaptivity.\n  As additional applications, we observe that our sampling results can be used\nto design a faster eigenvalue estimation sketch for dense matrices resolving a\nquestion of [Swartworth, Woodruff'23], and can also be combined with [Musco,\nMusco'17] to achieve $O(1/\\epsilon^3)$ (adaptive) sample complexity for\napproximating the spectrum of a bounded entry PSD matrix to $\\epsilon n$\nadditive error.",

    "abstract": "The epoch of reionization is a landmark in structure formation and galaxy\nevolution. How it happened is still not clear, especially regarding which\npopulation of objects was responsible for contributing the bulk of ionizing\nphotons toward this process. Doubly-peaked Lyman-Alpha profiles in this epoch\nare of particular interest since they hold information about the escape of\nionizing radiation and the environment surrounding the source.\n  We wish to understand the escape mechanisms of ionizing radiation in\nLyman-Alpha emitters during this time and the origin of a doubly-peaked\nLyman-alpha profile as well as estimating the size of a potential ionized\nbubble.\n  Using radiative transfer models, we fit the line profile of a bright\nLyman-Alpha emitter at $z\\sim 6.9$ using various gas geometries. The line\nmodeling reveals significant radiation escape from this system.\n  While the studied source reveals significant escape ($f_{esc}$(LyA) $\\sim0.8$\nas predicted by the best fitting radiative transfer model) and appears to\ninhabit an ionized bubble of radius $R_{b}\\approx\n0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}\\,pMpc\\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm\nage}}{10^{8}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.Radiative transfer modeling predicts the\nline to be completely redwards of the systemic redshift. We suggest the line\nmorphology is produced by inflows, multiple components emitting Ly$\\alpha$, or\nby an absorbing component in the red wing.\n  We propose that CDFS-1's profile holds two red peaks produced by winds within\nthe system. Its high $f_{esc}$(Lya) and the low-velocity offset from the\nsystemic redshift suggest that the source is an active ionizing agent. Future\nobservations will reveal whether a peak is present bluewards of the systemic\nredshift or if multiple components produce the profile.",

    "abstract": "Grid-forming technology has a crucial role in achieving the future all\nrenewable power grid. Among different types of grid-forming controllers,\nVirtual Oscillator (VO) based Controllers (VOCs) are the most advanced. VOCs\noutperform the conventional droop-based grid-forming controllers in terms of\ndynamic performance and synchronization stability by adapting time-domain-based\nimplementation. However, because of the time-domain-based implementation, the\nsame Fault Ride-through (FRT) techniques for droop-based controllers are\nincompatible with VOCs. Existing literature has successfully incorporated\ncurrent limiting techniques in VOCs to protect the converters during severe\ntransient conditions. Nevertheless, some very important aspects of FRT\nrequirements are not attended to by the existing literature on VOCs, such as\nmaintaining synchronization with the network during a fault, minimizing power\noscillation during a fault, and at the fault clearance. First, this article\nintroduces a unique analytical approach for quantifying the underlying dynamics\nof VOCs during faults. Next, using the mentioned analysis and in-depth\nreasoning, the systematic development of a unique FRT control architecture for\nVOCs is presented. The proposed FRT technique has unified both current and\nvoltage synchronization in the same architecture to work successfully under\nthree-phase and unbalanced faults.

The\noriginal problem regularized by the total number of nonzero components (also\nknow as $L_0$ regularization) is well-known to be NP-hard. The relaxation of\nthe $L_0$ regularization by using the $L_1$ norm offers a convex reformulation,\nbut is only exact under contain conditions (e.g., restricted isometry property)\nwhich might be NP-hard to verify. To overcome the computational hardness of the\n$L_0$ regularization problem while providing tighter results than the $L_1$\nrelaxation, several alternate optimization problems have been proposed to find\nsparse solutions. One such problem is the $L_1-L_2$ minimization problem, which\nis to minimize the difference of the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms subject to linear\nconstraints. This paper proves that solving the $L_1-L_2$ minimization problem\nis NP-hard.

The proposed filter is\nconstructed from a linear combination of sharp-modal filters where the weights\nare given by a convolutional neural network trained to replicate ILES results\nfrom filtered DNS data. In order to preserve the compactness of the\ndiscretization, the filter is local in time and acts at the elementary cell\nlevel. The neural network is trained on the data generated from the\nTaylor-Green Vortex test-case at Re=1600. In order to mitigate the temporal\neffects and highlight the influence of the spatial discretization, the ILES are\nperiodically restarted from DNS data for different time windows. Smaller time\nwindows result in higher cross-correlations between ILES and the filtered DNS\nsnapshots using the data-driven filters. The modal decay of the filter for the\nsmallest time window considered aligns with classical eigenanalysis, showing\nbetter energy conservation for higher orders of approximation. Similarly, an\nanalysis of the filter's kernel in the Fourier space confirms that higher\npolynomial orders are less dissipative compared to lower orders. As large time\nwindows are considered, the trained filter encounters difficulties in\nrepresenting the data due to significant non linear effects. Additionally, the\nimpact of the data-driven filter on the resolved kinetic energy has been\nassessed through the evaluation of the sub-grid production term which results\nin both direct and inverse cascades with the former being more likely on\naverage. The presence of backscatter suggests that ILES based on Discontinuous\nSpectral Element Methods might be equipped with an intrinsic mechanisms to\ntransfer energy in both directions with a predominance of direct kinetic energy\ncascade.",

I find\nthat these ``complementarity effects'' account for approximately 17% of the\ngender wage gap. Larger firms, high human capital, STEM degrees, and managerial\nroles are closely related to it. For instance, among managerial occupations,\nthe match effect goes as high as one-third of the total gap.

TPE\ncan identify a binary neutron star merger in 1 second (median value) and less\nthan 1000 matched-filter evaluations when 512 seconds of data is searched over.\nA stopping algorithm is used to curtail the TPE search if the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) threshold has been reached, or the SNR has not improved in 500\nevaluations. If the SNR threshold is surpassed, CMA-ES is used to recover the\nSNR and the template parameters in 9,000 matched filter iterations taking 48\nseconds (median value). GWtuna showcases alternatives to the standard template\nbank search and therefore has the potential to revolutionise the future of\ngravitational-wave data analysis.",

For the drones, we measure the RCS when they are are flying\nover a given point and while they are rotating over the same point. For human\nsubjects, we measure the RCS while standing still, sitting still and walking.\nFor quadruped robot and robotic arm, we consider a continuous random motion\nemulating different tasks which they are supposed to perfom in typical InF\nscenario.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial\nanalysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with\nestablished GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a\nframework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS\nas an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming\ncapabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and\ncode through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS\ntools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the\ndevelopment of a \"GIS Copilot\" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS\nusing natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was\nevaluated with over 100 spatial analysis tasks with three complexity levels:\nbasic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to\nperform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes\nwith multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which\ninvolve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user\ninstructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes\nthe necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates\nstrong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success\nrate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks,\nwhile challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This\nstudy contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway\nfor non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior\nexpertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot\ndemonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing\ndecision-making processes.",

The\ngoal of this work is to broaden the mathematical and statistical representation\nof a wireless channel through the study of CSI behavior and evolution over time\nand frequency.\n  CSI provides a high-level description of the behavior of a signal propagating\nfrom a transmitter to a receiver, thereby representing the structure of the\nenvironment where the signal propagates. This knowledge can be used to perform\nambvient sensing, a technique that extracts relevant information about the\nsurroundings of the receiver from the properties of the received signal, which\nare affected by interactions with the surfaces of the objects within the\nanalyzed environment. Ambient sensing already plays an essential role in new\nwireless networks such as 5G and Beyond 5G; its use Joint Communication and\nSensing applications and for the optimization of signal propagation through\nbeamforming could also enable the implementation of efficient cooperative\nambient sensing in vehicular networks, facilitating Cooperative Perception and,\nconsequently, increasing road safety.\n  Due to the lack of research on CSI characterization, this study aims to begin\nanalyzing the structure of CSI traces collected in a controlled experimental\nenvironment and to describe their statistical properties.

The surface code is a\nleading error-correcting code candidate because of its local topological\nstructure, experimentally achievable thresholds, and support for universal gate\noperations with magic states. However, its physical overhead scales\nquadratically with number of correctable errors. Conversely, quantum\nlow-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes offer superior scaling but lack, on\ntheir own, a clear path to universal logical computation. Therefore, it is\nbecoming increasingly evident is becoming that there are significant advantages\nto designing architectures using multiple codes. Heterogeneous architectures\nprovide a clear path to universal logical computation as well as the ability to\naccess different resource trade offs. To address this, we propose integrating\nthe surface code and gross code using an ancilla bus for inter-code data\nmovement. This approach involves managing trade-offs, including qubit overhead,\na constrained instruction set, and gross code (memory) routing and management.\nWhile our focus is on the gross-surface code architecture, our method is\nadaptable to any code combination and the constraints generated by that\nspecific architecture. Motivated by the potential reduction of physical qubit\noverhead, an ever important feature in the realization of fault tolerant\ncomputation, we perform the first full system study of heterogeneous\nerror-correcting codes, discovering architectural trade-offs and optimizing\naround them.

Many fundamental\nprimitives that are natural quantum analogs of OWFs or pseudorandom generators\n(PRGs) have been introduced, and their mutual relations and applications have\nbeen studied. Among them, pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs)\n[Ananth, Qian, and Yuen, Crypto 2022] are one of the most important primitives.\nPRFSGs are a natural quantum analogue of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and\nimply many applications such as IND-CPA secret-key encryption (SKE) and EUF-CMA\nmessage authentication code (MAC). However, only known constructions of\n(many-query-secure) PRFSGs are ones from OWFs or pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs).\nIn this paper, we construct classically-accessible adaptive secure PRFSGs in\nthe invertible quantum Haar random oracle (QHRO) model which is introduced in\n[Chen and Movassagh, Quantum]. The invertible QHRO model is an idealized model\nwhere any party can access a public single Haar random unitary and its inverse,\nwhich can be considered as a quantum analog of the random oracle model. Our\nPRFSG constructions resemble the classical Even-Mansour encryption based on a\nsingle permutation, and are secure against any unbounded polynomial number of\nqueries to the oracle and construction. To our knowledge, this is the first\napplication in the invertible QHRO model without any assumption or conjecture.\nThe previous best construction in the idealized model is PRFSGs secure up to\no({\\lambda}/ log {\\lambda}) queries in the common Haar state model [Ananth,\nGulati, and Lin, TCC 2024].",

After the importance of\nincluding inelastic scattering damage in theoretical models describing beam\ndamage, and the lack of oxygen-sensitivity under electron irradiation in 2D\nMoS2 were recently shown, the role of temperature has remained unexplored on a\nquantitative level. Here we show the effect of temperature on both the creation\nof individual defects as well as the effect of temperature on defect dynamics.\nBased on the measured displacement cross section of sulphur atoms in MoS2 by\natomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find an\nincreased probability for defect creation for temperatures up to 150{\\deg}C, in\naccordance with theoretical predictions. However, higher temperatures lead to a\ndecrease of the observed cross sections. Despite this apparent decrease, we\nfind that the elevated temperature does not mitigate the creation of defects as\nthis observation would suggest, but rather hides the created damage due to\nrapid thermal diffusion of the created vacancies before their detection,\nleading to the formation of vacancy lines and pores outside the measurement's\nfield of view. Using the experimental data in combination with previously\nreported theoretical models for the displacement cross section, we estimate the\nmigration energy barrier of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 to be 0.26 +- 0.13 eV.\nThese results mark another step towards the complete understanding of electron\nbeam damage in MoS2.",

An inverse dynamics-based\nenergy model is optionally extended with a single-parameter electrical model,\nsimplifying the model identification process. We compare the inertial and\nelectrical models on a collaborative robot, showing that simplified models\nprovide competitive accuracy and are easier to deploy in practice.",

    "abstract": "It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical\nsimulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical\nand have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution\nfunctions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this\nassumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to\nstudy the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show\nthat the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass\nloss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience\nmuch more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact,\nin the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid\ncusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback\nprocesses. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core\nthus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are\ntangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are\nnever disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the\npreferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation\npost stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity\ndistributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant\nmass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the\nmass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way\nsatellites.",

In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) sidelink, ISAC can provide\nenhanced safety by allowing vehicles to not only communicate with one another\nbut also sense the surrounding environment by using sidelink signals. In\nISAC-capable V2X sidelink, the random resource allocation results in an\nunstructured and sparse distribution of time and frequency resources in the\nreceived orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) grid, leading to\ndegraded radar detection performance when processed using the conventional\n2D-FFT method. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a high-resolution\noff-grid radar target detection algorithm irrespective of the OFDM grid\nstructure. The proposed method utilizes the Newtonized orthogonal matching\npursuit (NOMP) algorithm to effectively detect weak targets masked by the\nsidelobes of stronger ones and accurately estimates off-grid range and velocity\nparameters with minimal resources through Newton refinements. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NOMP-based target\ndetection algorithm compared to existing compressed sensing (CS) methods in\nterms of detection probability, resolution, and accuracy.

We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost\nall growth of supermassive black hole mass at $z>6$ does not take place in\nthese UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust\nand/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The\n`Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at\n$z>6$: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $\\ge$10\nsmaller than the total black hole mass volume density at $z=6$. This is valid\nunder a large range of assumption about luminosity and mass functions as well\nas accretion modes, and is likely still at least a factor $>$2 smaller when\naccounting for the known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting\nconsequences are: $>$90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the\nearly Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but\nhas to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted\nUV--visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington\nspecific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetime arguments for\nluminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This\nwould remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic\n`high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time.

    "abstract": "Large-scale training of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has enabled\nunprecedented quality in image generation. However, the key components of the\nbest performing LDM training recipes are oftentimes not available to the\nresearch community, preventing apple-to-apple comparisons and hindering the\nvalidation of progress in the field. In this work, we perform an in-depth study\nof LDM training recipes focusing on the performance of models and their\ntraining efficiency. To ensure apple-to-apple comparisons, we re-implement five\npreviously published models with their corresponding recipes. Through our\nstudy, we explore the effects of (i)~the mechanisms used to condition the\ngenerative model on semantic information (e.g., text prompt) and control\nmetadata (e.g., crop size, random flip flag, etc.) on the model performance,\nand (ii)~the transfer of the representations learned on smaller and\nlower-resolution datasets to larger ones on the training efficiency and model\nperformance. We then propose a novel conditioning mechanism that disentangles\nsemantic and control metadata conditionings and sets a new state-of-the-art in\nclass-conditional generation on the ImageNet-1k dataset -- with FID\nimprovements of 7% on 256 and 8% on 512 resolutions -- as well as text-to-image\ngeneration on the CC12M dataset -- with FID improvements of 8% on 256 and 23%\non 512 resolution.",

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache.\nOur experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher\nthroughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by\nup to 26.2 times.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative\nto post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST\nallows for a more memory efficient training process, as it maintains sparsity\nthroughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail\nto capitalize on this in practice. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much\nless efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, most implementations\nsimulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent\nadvances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of\nclassification with large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount.\nWith a label space of possibly millions of candidates, the classification layer\nalone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a\nfixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET);\nhowever, severely hampers training convergence, especially at the largest label\nspaces. We find that poor gradient flow from the sparse classifier to the dense\ntext encoder make it difficult to learn good input representations. By\nemploying an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we\nrecover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we\ndemonstrate the applicability and practical benefits of DST in a challenging\ndomain -- characterized by a highly skewed label distribution that differs\nsubstantially from typical DST benchmark datasets -- which enables end-to-end\ntraining with millions of labels on commodity hardware.",

Taken together, our results put the status of the quantum\nHamiltonian learning problem for continuous variable systems in a more advanced\nstate when compared to spins, where state-of-the-art results are either\nunavailable or quantitatively inferior to ours. In addition, we use our\ntechniques to obtain the first results on learning Gaussian states in trace\ndistance with a quadratic scaling in precision and polynomial in the number of\nmodes, albeit imposing certain restrictions on the Gaussian states. Our main\ntechnical innovations are several continuity bounds for the covariance and\nHamiltonian matrix of a Gaussian state, which are of independent interest,\ncombined with what we call the local inversion technique. In essence, the local\ninversion technique allows us to reliably infer the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian\nstate by only estimating in parallel submatrices of the covariance matrix whose\nsize scales with the desired precision, but not the number of modes. This way\nwe bypass the need to obtain precise global estimates of the covariance matrix,\ncontrolling the sample complexity.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly populated cities of the 21st Century face the challenge of\nbeing sustainable and resilient spaces for their inhabitants. However, climate\nchange, among other problems, makes these objectives difficult to achieve. The\nUrban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon that occurs in cities, increasing their\nthermal stress, is one of the stumbling blocks to achieve a more sustainable\ncity. The ability to estimate temperatures with a high degree of accuracy\nallows for the identification of the highest priority areas in cities where\nurban improvements need to be made to reduce thermal discomfort. In this work\nwe explore the usefulness of image-to-image deep neural networks (DNNs) for\ncorrelating spatial and meteorological variables of a urban area with\nstreet-level air temperature. The air temperature at street-level is estimated\nboth spatially and temporally for a specific use case, and compared with\nexisting, well-established numerical models. Based on the obtained results,\ndeep neural networks are confirmed to be faster and less computationally\nexpensive alternative for ground-level air temperature compared to numerical\nmodels.",

AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping\nto accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and\nstructures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven\napproaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the\nprocess of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches\nto the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse\nproblem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without\nutilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1)\nconditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an\narbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most\nenergetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2)\nconditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that\nincludes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types,\nchemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss\nfunction was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of\ncrystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching,\nusual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches.\nAs a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare\ntarget structure with generated one using default tolerances.

    "abstract": "One dimensional fluid/electron Monte Carlo simulations of capacitively\ncoupled Ar/O2 discharges driven by sawtooth up voltage waveforms are performed\nas a function of the number of consecutive harmonics driving frequencies of\n13.56 MHz, N (1-3), pressure (200-500 mTorr) and gas mixture (10-90 % admixture\nof O2 to Ar). The effects of these external parameters on the electron\ndynamics, and the transport of ions and neutrals are revealed at constant\npeak-to-peak driving voltage. The electronegativity is found to decline as the\nnumber of consecutive harmonics increases and the DC self-bias voltage\ndecreases. Increasing the pressure also leads to a decrease in\nelectronegativity. The combination of a decrease in the mean free path of\nelectrons and the presence of the Electrical Asymmetry Effect (EAE) result in\ndifferent spatio-temporal distributions of the ionization rate, which lead to a\nreduction in the amplitude of the DC self-bias at higher pressure. As the\nadmixture of electronegative O2 increases, the electronegativity is enhanced,\nand the discharge mode changes from an {\\alpha}-Drift Ambipolar (DA) hybrid to\nDA mode. This work focuses on linking these fundamental changes of the plasma\nphysics induced by changing external parameters to process relevant charged\nparticle and neutral fluxes to the electrodes. Particular attention is paid to\nO(1D) flux, because it is a precursor of deposition. In discharges driven by\nsawtooth up voltage waveforms, placing the substrate on the grounded electrode\nand increasing the number of consecutive harmonics, N, can facilitate the\ndeposition process, since the O(1D) flux to the substrate is higher in these\nscenarios. Moreover, at an O2 admixture of 20%, the O(1D) flux is nearly as\nhigh as that at an O2 admixture of 90%, indicating that a higher O(1D) flux can\nbe achieved without excessively increasing the O2 admixture.",

While various advanced\nforecasting and optimization methods have been developed to predict better and\naddress this uncertainty, most previous studies treat forecasting and\noptimization as separate tasks. This separation can lead to suboptimal results\ndue to misalignment between the objectives of the two tasks. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose a robust UC framework that integrates forecasting and\noptimization processes while ensuring statistical guarantees. In the\nforecasting stage, we combine multiple predictions derived from diverse data\nsources and methodologies for an improved prediction, aiming to optimize the UC\nperformance. In the optimization stage, the combined prediction is used to\nconstruct an uncertainty set with statistical guarantees, based on which the\nrobust UC model is formulated. The optimal robust UC solution provides feedback\nto refine the weight used for combining multiple predictions. To solve the\nproposed integrated forecasting-optimization framework efficiently and\neffectively, we develop a neural network-based surrogate model for acceleration\nand introduce a reshaping method for the uncertainty set based on the\noptimization result to reduce conservativeness.

To address these issues, we propose MA2, a GRF-based\nself-supervised and motion augmenting auto-encoder, which models the ADD task\nas an encoder-decoder paradigm. In the encoder, we introduce an embedding block\nincluding the 3-layer 1D convolution for extracting the token and a mask\ngenerator to randomly mask out the sequence of tokens to maximize the model's\npotential to capture high-level, discriminative, intrinsic representations.\nwhereafter, the decoder utilizes this information to reconstruct the pixel\nsequence of the origin input and calculate the reconstruction loss to optimize\nthe network. Moreover, the backbone of an auto-encoder is multi-head\nself-attention that can consider the global information of the token from the\ninput, not just the local neighborhood. This allows the model to capture\ngeneralized contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate MA2 has\nSOTA performance of 90.91% accuracy on 1% limited pathological GRF samples with\nlabels, and good generalization ability of 78.57% accuracy on scalable\nParkinson disease dataset.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates semantic communications between a transmitter and a\nreceiver, where original data, such as videos of interest to the receiver, is\nstored at the transmitter. Although significant process has been made in\nsemantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic\ninformation is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter alone,\nwithout considering the receiver's specific information needs. As a result,\ncritical information of primary concern to the receiver may be lost. In such\ncases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the receiver, as all\nreceived information is irrelevant to its interests. To solve this problem,\nthis paper presents a receiver-centric generative semantic communication\nsystem, where each transmission is initialized by the receiver. Specifically,\nthe receiver first sends its request for the desired semantic information to\nthe transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter\nextracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how\nthe transmitter understands the receiver's requests for semantic information\nand extracts the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust\nmanner. We address this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and\nleveraging off-the-shelf generative AI products, such as GPT-4, along with\nseveral specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results\ndemonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed new semantic\ncommunication system.",

We find that using a\ndetectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can\nsimultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark\nenergy, with high precision of $\\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\\%$ and\n$\\varepsilon(w)=4.5\\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint\nanalysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on\n$H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs\nwith future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with\nCMB.

In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to the study of\nmetric $k$-clustering problems in a dynamic setting, where the input keeps\nchanging via updates (point insertions/deletions), and we have to maintain a\ngood clustering throughout these updates. The performance of such a dynamic\nalgorithm is measured in terms of three parameters: (i) Approximation ratio,\nwhich signifies the quality of the maintained solution, (ii) Recourse, which\nsignifies how stable the maintained solution is, and (iii) Update time, which\nsignifies the efficiency of the algorithm.\n  We consider the metric $k$-median problem, where the objective is the sum of\nthe distances of the points to their nearest centers. We design the first\ndynamic algorithm for this problem with near-optimal guarantees across all\nthree performance measures (up to a constant factor in approximation ratio, and\npolylogarithmic factors in recourse and update time).

The proof is very general and is valid for\nseveral formulations of radiative heat flux; further, the same proof can be\nused to conclude that convective heat load, computed according to many of the\navailable formulations, is instead maximized by that trajectory. Further, a\nnovel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the\nattitude kinematics is introduced.

Such\nrepresentation is particularly appealing when considering depth-limited quantum\ncircuits within reach of current hardware.

We start with in-depth analyses of the strengths\nand limitations of the two most popular methods: occupancy-measure-based and\npolicy-based methods. We observe that while the occupancy-measure-based method\nis effective in addressing non-stationary environments, it encounters\ndifficulties with the unknown transition. In contrast, the policy-based method\ncan deal with the unknown transition effectively but faces challenges in\nhandling non-stationary environments. Building on this, we propose a novel\nalgorithm that combines the benefits of both methods. Specifically, it employs\n(i) an occupancy-measure-based global optimization with a two-layer structure\nto handle non-stationary environments; and (ii) a policy-based variance-aware\nvalue-targeted regression to tackle the unknown transition. We bridge these two\nparts by a novel conversion.

Two\ncritical concerns arise, relevant to the notions of consistency and continuity\nof care: (a) accuracy - the ML model, albeit more accurate, might introduce\nerrors that would not have occurred by applying the protocol; (b)\ninterpretability - ML models operating as black boxes might make predictions\nbased on relationships that contradict established clinical knowledge. In this\ncontext, the literature suggests using ML models integrating domain knowledge\nfor improved accuracy and interpretability. However, there is a lack of\nappropriate metrics for comparing ML models with clinical rules in addressing\nthese challenges. Accordingly, in this article, we first propose metrics to\nassess the accuracy of ML models with respect to the established protocol.\nSecondly, we propose an approach to measure the distance of explanations\nprovided by two rule sets, with the goal of comparing the explanation\nsimilarity between clinical rule-based systems and rules extracted from ML\nmodels. The approach is validated on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset by\ntraining two neural networks - one exclusively on data, and the other\nintegrating a clinical protocol.

We used six different seismic techniques to\ndistinguish RC and RGB stars, and tested two proposed methods for\ndistinguishing AGB and RGB stars. These status were compared with those\ninferred from spectroscopy. We present consensus evolutionary status for 18,784\nstars out of the 30,337 red giants present in the Kepler data, including 11,516\nstars with APOGEE spectra available. The agreement between seismic and\nspectroscopic classification is excellent for distinguishing RC stars, agreeing\nat the 94% level. Most disagreements can be traced to uncertainties in\nspectroscopic parameters, but some are caused by blends with background stars.\nWe find a sharp lower boundary in surface gravity at log(g) = 2.99+/-0.01 for\nthe RC and discuss the implications. We demonstrate that asteroseismic tools\nfor distinguishing AGB and RGB stars are consistent with spectroscopic\nevolutionary status at near the RC but that the agreement between the different\nmethods decreases rapidly as the star evolves.",

Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by\nexpanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training\na generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation\napproaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets.\nThe first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical\nimage processing technique, to create realistic image composites that\noutperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a\nnovel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to\nsynthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images.\nA comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that\neffective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for\nreaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion\nclassification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of\n33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on\nthe highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule\nendoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a\nfine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that\nan image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to\ngenerate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation.\nAdditionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical\nimage processing techniques further improves the results.",

In these problems the input is a set of reduced density matrices and\nthe task is to determine whether there exists a global pure state consistent\nwith these reduced density matrices. While mixed CLDM, i.e. where the global\nstate can be mixed, was proven to be QMA-complete by Broadbent and Grilo [JoC\n2022], almost nothing was known about the complexity of the pure version.\nBefore our work the best upper and lower bounds were QMA(2) and QMA. Our\ncontribution to the understanding of these problems is twofold.\n  Firstly, we define a pure state analogue of the complexity class QMA+ of\nAharanov and Regev [FOCS 2003], which we call PureSuperQMA. We prove that both\npure-N-Representability and PureCLDM are complete for this new class. Along the\nway we supplement Broadbent and Grilo by proving hardness for 2-qubit reduced\ndensity matrices and showing that mixed N-Representability is QMA-complete.\n  Secondly, we improve the upper bound on PureCLDM. Using methods from\nalgebraic geometry, we prove that PureSuperQMA is in PSPACE. Our methods, and\nthe PSPACE upper bound, are also valid for PureCLDM with exponential or even\nperfect precision, hence precisePureCLDM is not preciseQMA(2)=NEXP-complete,\nunless PSPACE=NEXP. We view this as evidence for a negative answer to the\nlongstanding open question whether PureCLDM is QMA(2)-complete.\n  The techniques we develop for our PSPACE upper bound are quite general. We\nare able to use them for various applications: from proving PSPACE upper bounds\non other quantum problems to giving an efficient parallel (NC) algorithm for\n(non-convex) quadratically constrained quadratic programs with few constraints.",

To address some of these questions, we present Loreli II, a\ndatabase of nearly 10 000 simulations of the 21 cm signal run with the Licorice\n3D radiative transfer code. With Loreli II, we explore a 5-dimensional\nastrophysical parameter space where star formation, X-ray emissions, and UV\nemissions are varied. We then use this database to train neural networks and\nperform Bayesian inference on 21 cm power spectra affected by thermal noise at\nthe level of 100 hours of observation with the Square Kilometer Array. We study\nand compare three inference techniques : an emulator of the power spectrum, a\nNeural Density Estimator that fits the implicit likelihood of the model, and a\nBayesian Neural Network that directly fits the posterior distribution. We\nmeasure the performances of each method by comparing them on a statistically\nrepresentative set of inferences, notably using the principles of\nSimulation-Based Calibration. We report errors on the 1-D marginalized\nposteriors (biases and over/under confidence) below $15 \\%$ of the standard\ndeviation for the emulator and below $25 \\%$ for the other methods. We conclude\nthat at our noise level and our sampling density of the parameter space, an\nexplicit Gaussian likelihood is sufficient.

Radial velocities derived\nfrom unpolarized line profiles are rotationally modulated as well, and exhibit\nadditional longer-term chromatic variability, most likely attributable to\nmagnetic activity rather than to a close-in giant planet (with a 3sigma upper\nlimit on its minimum mass of ~4 Mjup at a distance of ~0.2 au). We finally\nconfirm that accretion occurs at the surface of PDS 70, generating modulated\nred-shifted absorption in the 1083.3-nm He i triplet, and show that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field, often strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion\ndisc up to the corotation radius, weakens as the star gets fainter and redder\n(as in 2022), suggesting that dust from the disc more easily penetrates the\nstellar magnetosphere in such phases.",

Typically, most separation models are trained on synthetic data due to\nthe unavailability of target reference in real-world cocktail party scenarios.\nAs a result, there exists a domain gap between real and synthetic data when\ndeploying speech separation models in real-world applications. In this paper,\nwe propose a self-supervised domain-invariant pretrained (DIP) frontend that is\nexposed to mixture data without the need for target reference speech. The DIP\nfrontend utilizes a Siamese network with two innovative pretext tasks, mixture\npredictive coding (MPC) and mixture invariant coding (MIC), to capture shared\ncontextual cues between real and synthetic unlabeled mixtures. Subsequently, we\nfreeze the DIP frontend as a feature extractor when training the downstream\nspeech separation models on synthetic data. By pretraining the DIP frontend\nwith the contextual cues, we expect that the speech separation skills learned\nfrom synthetic data can be effectively transferred to real data. To benefit\nfrom the DIP frontend, we introduce a novel separation pipeline to align the\nfeature resolution of the separation models. We evaluate the speech separation\nquality on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets. The results confirm the\nsuperiority of our DIP frontend over existing speech separation models.

The nonlinear distortion caused\nby CE signaling must be mitigated by means of signal processing to improve the\nachievable sum rates. To this purpose, many linear and nonlinear precoding\ntechniques have been developed for the CE MIMO downlink. The vast majority of\nthese CE precoding techniques do not include a power allocation scheme, which\nis indispensable to achieve adequate performances in the downlink with channel\ngain imbalances between users. In this paper, we present two algorithms to\nproduce a power allocation scheme for regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding\nin CE MIMO downlink. Both techniques are based on transforming the CE quantized\nMIMO downlink to an approximately equivalent system of parallel\nsingle-input-single-output (SISO) channels. The first technique is proven to\nsolve the sum rate maximization problem in the approximate system optimally,\nwhereas the second technique obtains the local maximum with lower complexity.\nWe also extend another state-of-the-art quantization aware sum rate\nmaximization algorithm with linear precoding to the CE downlink. Numerical\nresults illustrate significant gains for the performance of the RZF precoder\nwhen the CE quantization is taken into account in a power allocation. Another\nkey numerical result is that the proposed RZF techniques achieve almost the\nidentical performance so that the one with lower computational complexity is\nchosen as the main method.

The\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong abilities in natural\nlanguage and code understanding, offers promising avenues for FPM. Yet current\nLLM-based FPM method faces two major limitations: 1. The warning-related code\nsnippets extracted are overly broad and cluttered with irrelevant control/data\nflows, reducing precision; 2. Critical code contexts are missing, leading to\nincomplete representations that can mislead LLMs and cause inaccurate\nassessments. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM4FPM , a lightweight\nand efficient false positive mitigation framework. It features eCPG-Slicer,\nwhich builds an extended code property graph (eCPG) to extract precise\nline-level code contexts for warnings. Furthermore, the integrated FARF\nalgorithm builds a file reference graph to identify all files that are relevant\nto warnings in linear time. This enables eCPG-Slicer to obtain rich contextual\ninformation without resorting to expensive whole-program analysis. LLM4FPM\noutperforms the existing method on the Juliet dataset (F1 > 99% across various\nCommon Weakness Enumerations) and improves label accuracy on the D2A dataset to\n86%.

We incorporate meson exchange and\npoint-coupling effective nucleon-nucleon interactions alongside the Bogoliubov\ntransformation for pairing corrections.

Recent advances have reframed this\nlearning problem by introducing the lower bound of minimal partition ratio,\ndenoted as $\\alpha$, as side information, referred to as ``$\\alpha$-sized\nworst-case fairness'' in this paper. We first justify the practical\nsignificance of this setting by presenting noteworthy evidence from the data\nprivacy perspective, which has been overlooked by existing research. Without\nimposing specific requirements on loss functions, we propose reweighting the\ntraining samples based on their intrinsic importance to fairness. Given the\nglobal nature of the worst-case formulation, we further develop a stochastic\nlearning scheme to simplify the training process without compromising model\nperformance. Additionally, we address the issue of outliers and provide a\nrobust variant to handle potential outliers during model training.

The Einstein field equations are postulated to have the same\nform as in standard general relativity, thus relating the Einstein tensor\nconstructed with the help of the semi-symmetric connection, with the\nenergy-momentum tensor.

These methods, however, compromise model accuracy due to\ntheir critical influence on gradient handling, particularly neglecting the\nsignificant contribution of small gradients during later training stages.

A large European consortium\nis contributing to the eXTP study, both for the science and the\ninstrumentation.

The WFM for eXTP is\nbased on the design originally proposed for the LOFT ESA M3 mission, that\nunderwent a Phase A feasibility study. It will be a wide field of view X-ray\nmonitor instrument working in the 2-50 keV energy range, achieved with\nlarge-area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs), similar to the ones used for the LAD\nbut with better spatial resolution. The WFM will consist of 3 pairs of coded\nmask cameras with a total combined field of view (FoV) of 90x180 degrees at\nzero response and a source localisation accuracy of ~1 arc min. The main goal\nof the WFM is to provide triggers for the target of opportunity observations of\nthe SFA, PFA and LAD, in order to perform the core science programme, dedicated\nto the study of matter under extreme conditions of density, gravity and\nmagnetism. In addition, the unprecedented combination of large field of view\nand imaging capability, down to 2 keV, of the WFM will allow eXTP to make\nimportant discoveries of the variable and transient X-ray sky, and provide\nX-ray coverage of a broad range of astrophysical objects covered under\n'observatory science', such as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts,\ngravitational wave electromagnetic counterparts.

However, despite the progress, current arts still have difficulty\ngeneralizing to unseen images with complex cloth deformation and body poses. In\nthis work, we present GarVerseLOD, a new dataset and framework that paves the\nway to achieving unprecedented robustness in high-fidelity 3D garment\nreconstruction from a single unconstrained image. Inspired by the recent\nsuccess of large generative models, we believe that one key to addressing the\ngeneralization challenge lies in the quantity and quality of 3D garment data.\nTowards this end, GarVerseLOD collects 6,000 high-quality cloth models with\nfine-grained geometry details manually created by professional artists. In\naddition to the scale of training data, we observe that having disentangled\ngranularities of geometry can play an important role in boosting the\ngeneralization capability and inference accuracy of the learned model. We hence\ncraft GarVerseLOD as a hierarchical dataset with levels of details (LOD),\nspanning from detail-free stylized shape to pose-blended garment with\npixel-aligned details. This allows us to make this highly under-constrained\nproblem tractable by factorizing the inference into easier tasks, each narrowed\ndown with smaller searching space. To ensure GarVerseLOD can generalize well to\nin-the-wild images, we propose a novel labeling paradigm based on conditional\ndiffusion models to generate extensive paired images for each garment model\nwith high photorealism. We evaluate our method on a massive amount of\nin-the-wild images. Experimental results demonstrate that GarVerseLOD can\ngenerate standalone garment pieces with significantly better quality than prior\napproaches. Project page: https://garverselod.github.io/",

Our goal is to show that kinematic features and pressure\nfeatures in handwriting can be used for the differential diagnosis of PD.\nMethods and Material: The database contains records from 37 PD patients and 38\nhealthy controls performing eight different handwriting tasks. The tasks\ninclude drawing an Archimedean spiral, repetitively writing orthographically\nsimple syllables and words, and writing of a sentence. In addition to the\nconventional kinematic features related to the dynamics of handwriting, we\ninvestigated new pressure features based on the pressure exerted on the writing\nsurface. To discriminate between PD patients and healthy subjects, three\ndifferent classifiers were compared: K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), ensemble\nAdaBoost classifier, and support vector machines (SVM). Results: For predicting\nPD based on kinematic and pressure features of handwriting, the best performing\nmodel was SVM with classification accuracy of Pacc = 81.3% (sensitivity Psen =\n87.4% and specificity of Pspe = 80.9%). When evaluated separately, pressure\nfeatures proved to be relevant for PD diagnosis, yielding Pacc = 82.5% compared\nto Pacc = 75.4% using kinematic features. Conclusion: Experimental results\nshowed that an analysis of kinematic and pressure features during handwriting\ncan help assess subtle characteristics of handwriting and discriminate between\nPD patients and healthy controls.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular solution to alleviate the high\nannotation cost in medical image classification. As a main branch of SSL,\nconsistency regularization engages in imposing consensus between the\npredictions of a single sample from different views, termed as Absolute\nLocation consistency (AL-c). However, only AL-c may be insufficient. Just like\nwhen diagnosing a case in practice, besides the case itself, the doctor usually\nrefers to certain related trustworthy cases to make more reliable\ndecisions.Therefore, we argue that solely relying on AL-c may ignore the\nrelative differences across samples, which we interpret as relative locations,\nand only exploit limited information from one perspective. To address this\nissue, we propose a Sample Consistency Mean Teacher (SCMT) which not only\nincorporates AL c but also additionally enforces consistency between the\nsamples' relative similarities to its related samples, called Relative Location\nconsistency (RL c). AL c and RL c conduct consistency regularization from two\ndifferent perspectives, jointly extracting more diverse semantic information\nfor classification. On the other hand, due to the highly similar structures in\nmedical images, the sample distribution could be overly dense in feature space,\nmaking their relative locations susceptible to noise. To tackle this problem,\nwe further develop a Sample Scatter Mean Teacher (SSMT) by utilizing\ncontrastive learning to sparsify the sample distribution and obtain robust and\neffective relative locations. Extensive experiments on different datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method.",

Despite their remarkable success, these\nempirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations,\nthus hindering potentially principled improvements.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multilevel tensor compression algorithm called tensor\nbutterfly algorithm for efficiently representing large-scale and\nhigh-dimensional oscillatory integral operators, including Green's functions\nfor wave equations and integral transforms such as Radon transforms and Fourier\ntransforms. The proposed algorithm leverages a tensor extension of the\nso-called complementary low-rank property of existing matrix butterfly\nalgorithms. The algorithm partitions the discretized integral operator tensor\ninto subtensors of multiple levels, and factorizes each subtensor at the middle\nlevel as a Tucker-type interpolative decomposition, whose factor matrices are\nformed in a multilevel fashion. For a $d$-dimensional integral operator\ndiscretized into a $2d$-mode tensor with $n^{2d}$ entries, the overall CPU time\nand memory requirement scale as $O(n^d)$, in stark contrast to the $O(n^d\\log\nn)$ requirement of existing matrix algorithms such as matrix butterfly\nalgorithm and fast Fourier transforms (FFT), where $n$ is the number of points\nper direction. When comparing with other tensor algorithms such as quantized\ntensor train (QTT), the proposed algorithm also shows superior CPU and memory\nperformance for tensor contraction. Remarkably, the tensor butterfly algorithm\ncan efficiently model high-frequency Green's function interactions between two\nunit cubes, each spanning 512 wavelengths per direction, which represents over\n$512\\times$ larger problem sizes than existing butterfly algorithms. On the\nother hand, for a problem representing 64 wavelengths per direction, which is\nthe largest size existing algorithms can handle, our tensor butterfly algorithm\nexhibits 200x speedups and $30\\times$ memory reduction comparing with existing\nones. Moreover, the tensor butterfly algorithm also permits $O(n^d)$-complexity\nFFTs and Radon transforms up to $d=6$ dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used neuroimaging\ntechnique known for its cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness. However,\nvarious artifacts, particularly biological artifacts like Electromyography\n(EMG) signals, lead to a poor signal-to-noise ratio, limiting the precision of\nanalyses and applications. The currently reported EEG data cleaning performance\nlargely depends on the data used for validation, and in the case of machine\nlearning approaches, also on the data used for training. The data are typically\ngathered either by recruiting subjects to perform specific artifact tasks or by\nintegrating existing datasets. Prevailing approaches, however, tend to rely on\nintuitive, concept-oriented data collection with minimal justification for the\nselection of artifacts and their quantities. Given the substantial costs\nassociated with biological data collection and the pressing need for effective\ndata utilization, we propose an optimization procedure for data-oriented data\ncollection design using deep learning-based artifact detection. Approach. We\napply a binary classification between artifact epochs (time intervals\ncontaining artifacts) and non-artifact epochs (time intervals containing no\nartifact) using three different neural architectures. Our aim is to minimize\ndata collection efforts while preserving the cleaning efficiency. Main results.\nWe were able to reduce the number of artifact tasks from twelve to three and\ndecrease repetitions of isometric contraction tasks from ten to three or\nsometimes even just one. Significance. Our work addresses the need for\neffective data utilization in biological data collection, offering a systematic\nand dynamic quantitative approach. By providing clear justifications for the\nchoices of artifacts and their quantity, we aim to guide future studies toward\nmore effective and economical data collection in EEG and EMG research.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gaining popularity for processing\ngraph-structured data. In real-world scenarios, graph data within the same\ndataset can vary significantly in scale. This variability leads to\ndepth-sensitivity, where the optimal depth of GNN layers depends on the scale\nof the graph data. Empirically, fewer layers are sufficient for message passing\nin smaller graphs, while larger graphs typically require deeper networks to\ncapture long-range dependencies and global features. However, existing methods\ngenerally use a fixed number of GNN layers to generate representations for all\ngraphs, overlooking the depth-sensitivity issue in graph structure data. To\naddress this challenge, we propose the depth adaptive mixture of expert\n(DA-MoE) method, which incorporates two main improvements to GNN backbone:\n\\textbf{1)} DA-MoE employs different GNN layers, each considered an expert with\nits own parameters. Such a design allows the model to flexibly aggregate\ninformation at different scales, effectively addressing the depth-sensitivity\nissue in graph data. \\textbf{2)} DA-MoE utilizes GNN to capture the structural\ninformation instead of the linear projections in the gating network. Thus, the\ngating network enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies\nwithin the data. By leveraging these improvements, each expert in DA-MoE\nspecifically learns distinct graph patterns at different scales. Furthermore,\ncomprehensive experiments on the TU dataset and open graph benchmark (OGB) have\nshown that DA-MoE consistently surpasses existing baselines on various tasks,\nincluding graph, node, and link-level analyses.

To\naddress each of the found limitations, we present three novel backdoor attack\nmethods on SNNs, i.e., Framed, Strobing, and Flashy Backdoor. We also assess\nthe effectiveness of traditional backdoor procedures and defenses adapted for\nSNNs, such as pruning, fine-tuning, and fine-pruning. The results show that\nwhile these procedures and defenses can mitigate some attacks, they often fail\nagainst stronger methods like Flashy Backdoor or sacrifice too much clean\naccuracy, rendering the models unusable.\n  Overall, all our methods can achieve up to a 100% Attack Success Rate while\nmaintaining high clean accuracy in every tested dataset. Additionally, we\nevaluate the stealthiness of the triggers with commonly used metrics, finding\nthem highly stealthy.

Both complex movement\npatterns and the stabilization of the highly mobile joint rely on intricate\nthree-dimensional interactions among various components. Continuum-based finite\nelement models can capture such complexity, and are thus particularly relevant\nin shoulder biomechanics. Considering their role as active joint stabilizers\nand force generators, skeletal muscles require special attention regarding\ntheir constitutive description. In this contribution, we propose a constitutive\ndescription to model active skeletal muscle within complex musculoskeletal\nsystems, focusing on a novel continuum shoulder model. We thoroughly review\nexisting material models before analyzing three selected ones in detail: an\nactive-stress, an active-strain, and a generalized active-strain approach. To\nestablish a basis for comparison, we identify the material parameters based on\nexperimental stress-strain data obtained under various active and passive\nloading conditions. We discuss the concepts to incorporate active contractile\nbehavior from a mathematical and physiological perspective, address analytical\nand numerical challenges arising from the mathematical formulations, and\nanalyze the included biophysical principles of force generation in terms of\nphysiological correctness and relevance for human shoulder modeling. Based on\nthese insights, we present an improved constitutive model combining the studied\nmodels' most promising and relevant features. Using the example of a fusiform\nmuscle, we investigate force generation, deformation, and kinematics during\nactive isometric and free contractions.

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous\nvehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made\nsignificant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV)\nrepresentation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of\ndynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In\nthis paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal\ninformation into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach\ncomprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator\n(MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and\nimage features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby\ngenerating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts\ntwo simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV\nsegmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from\nthe MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple\ntimestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects,\nCRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection\naccuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for\nradar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous\nbest method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading\napproach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics\nshowcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the\nreliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.",

    "abstract": "In a ride-pooling system, travellers experience discomfort associated with a\ndetour and a longer travel time, which is compensated with a sharing discount.\nMost studies assume travellers receive either a flat discount or, in rare\ncases, a proportional to the inconvenience. We show the system benefits from\nindividually tailored fares. We argue that fares that optimise an expected\nprofit of an operator also improve system-wide performance if they include\ntravellers' acceptance.\n  Our pricing method is set in a heterogeneous population, where travellers\nhave varying levels of value-of-time and willingness-to-share, unknown to the\noperator. A high fare discourages clients from the service, while a low fare\nreduces the profit margin. Notably, a shared ride is only realised if accepted\nby all co-travellers (decision is driven by the latent behavioural factors).\n  Our method reveals intriguing properties of the shareability topology. Not\nonly identifies rides efficient for the system and supports them with reduced\nfares (to increase their realisation probability), but also identifies\ntravellers unattractive for the system (e.g. due to incompatibility with other\ntravellers) and effectively shifts them to private rides via high fares. Unlike\nin previous methods, such approach naturally balances the travellers\nsatisfaction and the profit maximisation. With an experiment set in NYC, we\nshow that this leads to significant improvements over the flat discount\nbaseline: the mileage (proxy for environmental externalities) is reduced by\n4.5% and the operator generates more profit per mile (over 20% improvement). We\nargue that ride pooling systems with fares that maximise profitability are more\nsustainable and efficient if they include travellers' satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Causal understanding is a fundamental goal of evidence-based medicine. When\nrandomization is impossible, causal inference methods allow the estimation of\ntreatment effects from retrospective analysis of observational data. However,\nsuch analyses rely on a number of assumptions, often including that of no\nunobserved confounding. In many practical settings, this assumption is violated\nwhen important variables are not explicitly measured in the clinical record.\nPrior work has proposed to address unobserved confounding with machine learning\nby imputing unobserved variables and then correcting for the classifier's\nmismeasurement. When such a classifier can be trained and the necessary\nassumptions are met, this method can recover an unbiased estimate of a causal\neffect. However, such work has been limited to synthetic data, simple\nclassifiers, and binary variables. This paper extends this methodology by using\na large language model trained on clinical notes to predict patients' smoking\nstatus, which would otherwise be an unobserved confounder. We then apply a\nmeasurement error correction on the categorical predicted smoking status to\nestimate the causal effect of transthoracic echocardiography on mortality in\nthe MIMIC dataset.",

We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential to a\nmulti-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with\nan optimum of performance and precision in large complex atomistic systems. The\nrequired precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and\nupdated automatically during simulation.

The approach is developed for the\nmolecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent\nproblems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it\nsuitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed\nadaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces and -energies\nwith a precision of 10 meV/{\\AA} and 0 meV for the precisely calculated atoms\nin a nanoindentation of 4 million atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a\nspeedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.",

These observations will allow\nsignificant improvements in our understanding of helium stars. However, in the\ncreation of these stars their companions may accrete a significant amount of\nhelium-rich stellar material. These creates stars with unusual composition\nprofiles -- stars with helium-rich cores, hydrogen-rich lower envelopes and a\nhelium-rich outer envelope. Thus the mean molecular weight reaches a minimum in\nthe the middle of the star rather than continuously decreasing outwards in\nmass. To demonstrate this structure we present Cambridge STARS model\ncalculations of an example interacting binary systems where the helium-rich\nmaterial is transferred, and compare it to one where the composition of the\naccreted mass is fixed to the companion's surface composition. We show that the\nhelium-rich material leads to the accretor being 0.2 dex hotter and 0.15 dex\nmore luminous than models where the composition is not helium rich. We use a\nsimple BPASS v2.2 population model to estimate that helium-rich mass transfer\noccurs in 23 per cent of massive binaries that undergo mass transfer. This\nsuggests this is a common process.

    "abstract": "Band alignment of metal contacts to 2D semiconductors often deviate from the\nideal Shottky-Mott (SM) rule due to the non-ideal factors such as the formation\nof interface dipole and metal-induced gap states (MIGS). Although MIGS can be\nstrongly suppressed using van der Waals (vdW) contact engineering, the\ninterface dipole is hard to eliminate due to the electronegativity difference\nof the two contacting materials. Here we show that interface dipole can be\npractically eliminated in 2D semiconducting MoSi$_2$N$_4$ when contacted by its\nhomologous metallic counterpart MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN)$_n$ ($n = 1-4$). The SiN\nouter sublayers, simultaneously present in both MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and\nMoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN)$_n$, creates nearly equal charge `push-back' effect at the\ncontact interface. This nearly symmetrical charge redistribution leads to zero\nnet electron transfer across the interface, resulting in a \\emph{zero-dipole}\ncontact. Intriguingly, we show that even in the extreme close-contact case\nwhere MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN) is arbitrarily pushed towards MoSi$_2$N$_4$ with\nextremely small interlayer distance, the interface dipole remains practically\nzero. Such \\emph{zero-dipole} Schottky contact represents a peculiar case where\nthe SM rule, usually expected to occur only in the non-interacting regime,\nmanifests in MoSi$_2$N$_4$/MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN)$_n$ vdWH even though the\nconstituent monolayers interact strongly.

    "abstract": "For classification models based on neural networks, the maximum predicted\nclass probability is often used as a confidence score. This score rarely\npredicts well the probability of making a correct prediction and requires a\npost-processing calibration step. However, many confidence calibration methods\nfail for problems with many classes. To address this issue, we transform the\nproblem of calibrating a multiclass classifier into calibrating a single\nsurrogate binary classifier. This approach allows for more efficient use of\nstandard calibration methods. We evaluate our approach on numerous neural\nnetworks used for image or text classification and show that it significantly\nenhances existing calibration methods.",

We observe that an increase in either the BH charge $Q$ or the field\ncharge $q$ when $qQ>0$ leads to a smaller absorption cross section and a\nwidening of the interference fringes in the scattering cross section, while the\nincrease in the field mass enlarges the absorption cross section and the width\nof the interference fringes.

While the Cartesian basis is adept at\ncapturing high-frequency features, it is susceptible to overfitting and\ninefficiencies due to the high number of degrees of freedom. The Zernike basis\nefficiently represents common optical aberrations but struggles with complex or\nnon-standard wavefronts such as optical vortices, Bessel beams, or wavefronts\nwith sharp discontinuities. This paper introduces a novel approach to wavefront\nreconstruction using an over-complete phase dictionary combined with sparse\nrepresentation techniques. By constructing a dictionary that includes a diverse\nset of basis functions - ranging from Zernike polynomials to specialized\nfunctions representing optical vortices and other complex modes - we enable a\nmore flexible and efficient representation of complex wavefronts. Furthermore,\na trainable affine transform is implemented to account for misalignment.\nUtilizing principles from compressed sensing and sparse coding, we enforce\nsparsity in the coefficient space to avoid overfitting and enhance robustness\nto noise.",

Previously, the\nbest-known counting and sampling algorithms required far more restricted\ndensities $\\alpha\\lesssim 2^{k/3}$ [He, Wu, Yang, SODA '23].

Crucially, our\nanalysis avoids reliance on the $2$-tree structure used in prior works, which\ncannot extend beyond the worst-case threshold $2^{k/2}$. Instead, we employ a\nwitness tree similar to that used in the analysis of the Moser-Tardos algorithm\n[Moser, Tardos, JACM '10] for the Lov\\'{a}sz Local lemma, which may be of\nindependent interest. Our new analysis provides a universal framework for\nefficient counting and sampling for random atomic CSPs, including, for example,\nrandom hypergraph colorings.

Currently, most NeRF methods either\nrequire accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both.\nReconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and\nhighly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method\nreconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically,\nwe build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them\nfrom many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose\nretrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the\ndensity supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose\nretrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen\nproblem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is\ntrained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera\nposes are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and\nfine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners.\nComprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF\nsuccessfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved\nCAD models, showing the generalization abilities.",

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation,\ndemonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly\nin autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is\ncrucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can\nsignificantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations.\nTraditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in\nsegmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook\nspatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address\nthese challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully\nleverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This\nlimitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits\nthe unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the\nRegion-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a\nRegion-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted\nperturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting\nin erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves\nhigh success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the\nneed for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only\nreveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more\nresilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.",

Here, we both\ninitiate and probe molecular dynamics in acetylene with intense 6-fs\ncross-polarized pulse pairs, separated by a variable delay. Following multiple\nionization by the first pulse, acetylene undergoes simultaneous elongation of\nthe carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, enabling further ionization by the\nsecond pulse and the formation of a very highly charged state,\n[C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$. At small inter-pulse delays ($<$20 fs), this enhancement\noccurs when the molecule is aligned to the probe pulse. Conversely, at large\ndelays ($>$40 fs), formation of [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$ occurs when the molecule is\naligned to the pump pulse. By analyzing the polarization and time dependence of\nsequentially ionized [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$, we resolve two distinct pathways that\nboth contribute to a large increase in the multiple ionization yield.

    "abstract": "LiDAR Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in autonomous driving\nperception consisting of associating each LiDAR point to a semantic label.\nFully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels\nfor each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts\nof expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside\nLiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation\nmodels, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge\nfrom 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges.\nFor example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax\neffect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective\ncapture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage\nunlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera\nimages. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary\nNeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel\nfeatures. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled\nray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we\nquery the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to\ngenerate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered\npixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel\npredictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with\nonly LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR\nSemantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.",

We introduce two protocols and show that, on average, the\nteleportation succeeds in teleporting the spin variables of a spin coherent\nstate with average zero angular error in the ideal case, beating classical\nstrategies based on quantum state estimation. In a single run of the\nteleportation, there is an angular error at the level of ~ 0.1 radians for\nlarge ensembles.

    "abstract": "Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. Identifying\nemotion from speech is a nontrivial task due to the ambiguous definition of\nemotion itself. Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for\nunderstanding human emotional behavior. The SER task is challenging due to the\nvariety of speakers, background noise, complexity of emotions, and speaking\nstyles. It has many applications in education, healthcare, customer service,\nand Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Previously, conventional machine learning\nmethods such as SVM, HMM, and KNN have been used for the SER task. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have become popular, with convolutional neural\nnetworks and recurrent neural networks being used for SER tasks. The input of\nthese methods is mostly spectrograms and hand-crafted features. In this work,\nwe study the use of self-supervised transformer-based models, Wav2Vec2 and\nHuBERT, to determine the emotion of speakers from their voice. The models\nautomatically extract features from raw audio signals, which are then used for\nthe classification task. The proposed solution is evaluated on reputable\ndatasets, including RAVDESS, SHEMO, SAVEE, AESDD, and Emo-DB. The results show\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method on different datasets. Moreover, the\nmodel has been used for real-world applications like call center conversations,\nand the results demonstrate that the model accurately predicts emotions.",

Plain text\ndocuments or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However,\nmuch of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as\nheadings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG\nprocess. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead\nof plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is\nbetter than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most\nLLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML\npresents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags,\nJavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to\nthe RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression,\nand a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while\nminimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the\nsuperiority of using HTML in RAG systems.",

Employing a mapping\nbetween hydrodynamic variables and U(1) gauge-field strengths, we derive a U(1)\ngauge theory for topologically nontrivial waves. The resulting U(1) gauge\ntheory is given by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an additional term\nassociated with odd viscosity.

    "abstract": "Kinematic sensors are often used to analyze movement behaviors in sports and\ndaily activities due to their ease of use and lack of spatial restrictions,\nunlike video-based motion capturing systems. Still, the generation, and\nespecially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be\ntime-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited\ndata, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns.\nTo address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the\ndiversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a\nprobabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time\nseries generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time\nseries sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities.\nMoreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant\nimprovement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In\nsome cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%.\nIMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity\nmovements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited\ntraining data.",

However, these systems, often referred to as\nmembrane-based DMGGs, exhibit delayed gradient formation due to the\nincorporated flow-resistant membrane. This limitation substantially hinders\ntheir application in dynamic and time-sensitive studies. Here, we accelerate\nthe gradient response in DMGGs by removing the membrane and implementing new\ngeometrical configurations to compensate for the membrane's role in suppressing\nparasitic flows. We introduce these novel configurations into two microfluidic\ndesigns: the H-junction and the Y-junction. In the H-junction design, parasitic\nflow is redirected through a bypass channel following the gradient region. The\nY-junction design features a shared discharge channel that allows converging\ndischarge flow streams, preventing the buildup of parasitic pressure downstream\nof the gradient region. Using hydraulic circuit analysis and fluid dynamics\nsimulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the H-junction and Y-junction\ndesigns in suppressing parasitic pressure flows. These computational results,\nsupported by experimental data from particle image velocimetry, confirm the\ncapability of our designs to generate a highly stable, accurate, and\nconvection-free gradient with rapid formation. These advantages make the\nH-junction and Y-junction designs ideal experimental platforms for a wide range\nof in-vitro studies, including drug testing, cell chemotaxis, and stem cell\ndifferentiation.",

Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion\nmodels, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher\ncomputational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models,\npre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve\nthe high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a\nlower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI\nreconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control\nmechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR\nphysics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these\nchallenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI\nreconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these\nchallenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction\nstrategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an\nMRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92\ndB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE\n\\cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM\nsampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space.\nExperiments on the fastMRI dataset\\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across\nvarious scenarios.

In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to\nhandcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the\ninference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent\nbreakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically\ngeared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the\nunderlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term\nstatistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based\non control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to\nensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it\ncurrently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data\nmodalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous\nstates due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and\nphysiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level\ndependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or\nCa$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model\nnon-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting\nthe recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel\nalgorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model\ndimensionality and filter length.

However, like humans, these end-to-end translation models\nmay not always generate the best SQL output on their first try. In this paper,\nwe propose CycleSQL, an iterative framework designed for end-to-end translation\nmodels to autonomously generate the best output through self-evaluation.

Extensive experiments, including quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations, are conducted to study CycleSQL by applying it to\nseven existing translation models on five widely used benchmarks. The results\nshow that 1) the feedback loop introduced in CycleSQL can consistently improve\nthe performance of existing models, and in particular, by applying CycleSQL to\nRESDSQL, obtains a translation accuracy of 82.0% (+2.6%) on the validation set,\nand 81.6% (+3.2%) on the test set of Spider benchmark; 2) the generated NL\nexplanations can also provide insightful information for users, aiding in the\ncomprehension of translation results and consequently enhancing the\ninterpretability of NL2SQL translation.",

    "abstract": "The world is facing a multitude of challenges that hinder the development of\nhuman civilization and the well-being of humanity on the planet. The\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations in\n2015 to address these global challenges by 2030. Natural language processing\ntechniques can help uncover discussions on SDGs within research literature. We\npropose a completely automated pipeline to 1) fetch content from the Scopus\ndatabase and prepare datasets dedicated to five groups of SDGs; 2) perform\ntopic modeling, a statistical technique used to identify topics in large\ncollections of textual data; and 3) enable topic exploration through\nkeywords-based search and topic frequency time series extraction. For topic\nmodeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large\ncorpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of\nthousands of documents), introducing i) a novel LLM-based embeddings\ncomputation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space and\nii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for\nany new big datasets. We additionally produce the visualization of results on\ninteractive dashboards reporting topics' temporal evolution. Results are made\ninspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic\nmodeling process. Our proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline for big-text\ndatasets allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude\ntoward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006-2023 time span. All the\nresults are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized\nto be applied at any point in time to any big corpus of textual documents.",

Obtaining a constant approximation algorithm is\nan open problem in the field that has recently attracted considerable\nattention.\n  We give the first such algorithm for the problem, thus solving the open\nproblem in the affirmative. Our algorithm is based on the natural Configuration\nLP for the problem, which was introduced recently by Feng and Li~\\cite{FL24}\nfor the additive valuation case. Our rounding algorithm is similar to that of\nLi \\cite{Li25} developed for the unrelated machine scheduling problem to\nminimize weighted completion time. Roughly speaking, we designate the largest\nitem in each configuration as a large item and the remaining items as small\nitems. So, every agent gets precisely 1 fractional large item in the\nconfiguration LP solution. With the rounding algorithm in \\cite{Li25}, we can\nensure that in the obtained solution, every agent gets precisely 1 large item,\nand the assignments of small items are negatively correlated.",

    "abstract": "Time series foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in\nzero-shot learning, making them well-suited for predicting rapidly evolving\npatterns in real-world applications where relevant training data are scarce.\nHowever, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which\nincurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we\nintroduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series\nforecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal\ndependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high\nprediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training\ncosts, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages\npretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate\ntraining set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are\noptimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the\nmodel trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term\nforecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying\nchannel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is\nintroduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific\nmultivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is\ncomparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using\nsignificantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior\nfull-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code\nwill be made publicly available.",

For initial data\n$u_0$ compactly supported or in a weighted $L^1(G/K)$ space with a weight\ndepending on $p\\in [1, \\infty]$, we introduce a mass function\n$M_p(u_0)(\\cdot)$, and prove that if $h_t$ is the heat kernel on $G/K$, then\n$$\\|h_t\\|_p^{-1}\\,\\|u_0\\ast h_t \\, - \\,M_p(u_0)(\\cdot)\\,h_t\\|_p \\rightarrow 0\n\\quad \\text{as} \\quad t\\rightarrow \\infty.$$ Interestingly, the $L^p$ heat\nconcentration leads to completely different expressions of the mass function\nfor $1\\leq p <2$ and $2\\leq p\\leq \\infty$.

Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically\npredefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive\nRetrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws\ncannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question\nanswering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily\nobtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we\nfirst construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of \"dynamic\"\nquestions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in\nquery, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2)\nQuestions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments\non Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient\nand precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid\nretrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning\nagent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate\nthe human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex\nmultimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action.

Williams (STOC 2010) showed how to derive nonuniform\nlower bounds from uniform upper bounds: by designing a fast algorithm for\nchecking satisfiability of circuits, one gets a lower bound for this circuit\nclass. Since then, a number of results of this kind have been proved. For\nexample, Jahanjou et al. (ICALP 2015) and Carmosino et al. (ITCS 2016) proved\nthat if NSETH fails, then $\\text{E}^{\\text{NP}}$ has series-parallel circuit\nsize $\\omega(n)$.\n  One can also derive nonuniform lower bounds from nondeterministic uniform\nlower bounds.

In this paper, we continue developing this line of\nresearch and show how uniform nondeterministic lower bounds can be used to\nconstruct generators of various types of combinatorial objects: Boolean\nfunctions of high circuit size, matrices of high rigidity, and tensors of high\nrank. Specifically, we prove the following. If $k$-SAT cannot be solved in\ninput-oblivious co-nondeterministic time $O(2^{(1/2+\\varepsilon)n})$, then\nthere exists a monotone Boolean function family in coNP of monotone circuit\nsize $2^{\\Omega(n / \\log n)}$. This implies win-win circuit lower bounds:\neither $\\text{E}^{\\text{NP}}$ requires series-parallel circuits of size\n$\\omega(n)$ or coNP requires monotone circuits of size $2^{\\Omega(n / \\log\nn)}$. If MAX-3-SAT cannot be solved in co-nondeterministic time $O(2^{(1 -\n\\varepsilon)n})$, then there exist small families of matrices with high\nrigidity as well as small families of three-dimensional tensors of high rank.",

Graph-based machine\nlearning techniques have emerged as promising tools for Anti-Money Laundering\n(AML) detection, capturing intricate relationships within money laundering\nnetworks.

Leveraging Fully\nHomomorphic Encryption (FHE), computations are directly performed on encrypted\ndata, ensuring the confidentiality of financial data. Notably, FHE over the\nTorus (TFHE) was integrated with graph-based machine learning using Zama\nConcrete ML. The research contributes two key privacy-preserving pipelines.\nFirst, the development of a privacy-preserving Graph Neural Network (GNN)\npipeline was explored. Optimization techniques like quantization and pruning\nwere used to render the GNN FHE-compatible. Second, a privacy-preserving\ngraph-based XGBoost pipeline leveraging Graph Feature Preprocessor (GFP) was\nsuccessfully developed. Experiments demonstrated strong predictive performance,\nwith the XGBoost model consistently achieving over 99% accuracy, F1-score,\nprecision, and recall on the balanced AML dataset in both unencrypted and\nFHE-encrypted inference settings.

For demonstration, we also present two\nspecial cases within the framework, together with their optimizations and\nconvergence analyses.

[Nature 567,\n209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with\nquantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary\nclassification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential\npathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary\nclassification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification\nproblems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously\ndemonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass\nclassification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To\ndemonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within\nthe quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate\nthe corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations\nreveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in\nhandling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we\nleverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the\nclassification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The\nresults demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification\nand better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.",

However, designing MB-EON\nnetworks introduces complex challenges, notably the optimization of physical\nparameters like optical power and quality of transmission (QoT).\nFrequency-dependent characteristics of fiber, such as loss, dispersion, and\nnonlinear effects, alongside inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering, pose\nsignificant hurdles when extending beyond the L+C (LC) band to a continuous\nspectrum over 100 nm.\n  In this study, we propose a span-by-span methodology for optimal power\nallocation, introducing two hyper-accelerated power optimization (HPO)\nstrategies: flat launch power (FLP) and flat received power (FRP). These\napproaches significantly expedite network power optimization while preserving\nthe stability of running services. Our comparative analysis of FLP and FRP\nmodels reveals that while FRP has a minimal effect on capacity (increasing less\nthan 10 Tbps for an L+C+S (LCS) system over 100 km), it improves flatness and\nGSNR/OSNR metrics in the S-band by approximately 2/0 dB and 2.5/6 dB,\nrespectively.\n  A network-wide analysis across various topologies shows that the FRP\ntechnique enhances minimum GSNR, contributing to a throughput increase of 12%\nto 75%, depending on network scale, at a 1% bandwidth blocking rate. Lastly,\nour application of HPO in MB-EON for both local and global power optimization\ndemonstrates that while both approaches offer comparable performance, global\noptimization is simpler and more cost-effective for large-scale networks.",

On one hand, dissipation-induced nonlinear interactions\namplify LGI violations compared to Hermitian systems; on the other hand,\ndissipation leads to decoherence, which could weaken the LGI violation. In this\npaper, we investigate a non-Hermitian system of ultracold Fermi gas with\ndissipation. Our experiments reveal that as dissipation increases, the upper\nbound of the third-order LGI parameter $K_3$ initially rises, reaching its\nmaximum at the exceptional point (EP), where $K_3 = C_{21} + C_{32} - C_{31}$,\nencompassing three two-time correlation functions. Beyond a certain dissipation\nthreshold, the LGI violation weakens, approaching the classical limit,\nindicating a quantum-to-classical transition (QCT). Furthermore, we observe\nthat the LGI violation decreases with increasing evolution time, reinforcing\nthe QCT in the time domain. This study provides a crucial stepping stone for\nusing the LGI to explore the QCT in many-body open quantum systems.",

Jackknife is a form of resampling,\nwidely used for bias correction and variance estimation, that is\nwell-understood under classical scaling where the sample size $n$ grows for a\nfixed problem. We study its behavior in application to estimating functionals\nusing high-dimensional $Z$-estimators, allowing both the sample size $n$ and\nproblem dimension $d$ to diverge. We begin showing that the plug-in estimator\nbased on the $Z$-estimate suffers from a quadratic breakdown: while it is\n$\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal whenever $n \\gtrsim d^2$, it\nfails for a broad class of problems whenever $n \\lesssim d^2$. We then show\nthat under suitable regularity conditions, applying a jackknife correction\nyields an estimate that is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal\nwhenever $n\\gtrsim d^{3/2}$. This provides strong motivation for the use of\njackknife in high-dimensional problems where the dimension is moderate relative\nto sample size.

Low-bandwidth methods like\nfederated learning (FL) could enable collaborative training of larger models\nacross weakly-connected GPUs if they can effectively be used for pre-training.\nTo achieve this, we introduce Photon, the first complete system for federated\nend-to-end LLM training, leveraging cross-silo FL for global-scale training\nwith minimal communication overheads. Using Photon, we train the first\nfederated family of decoder-only LLMs from scratch. We show that: (1) Photon\ncan train model sizes up to 7B in a federated fashion while reaching an even\nbetter perplexity than centralized pre-training; (2) Photon model training time\ndecreases with available compute, achieving a similar compute-time trade-off to\ncentralized; and (3) Photon outperforms the wall-time of baseline distributed\ntraining methods by 35% via communicating 64x-512xless. Our proposal is robust\nto data heterogeneity and converges twice as fast as previous methods like\nDiLoCo. This surprising data efficiency stems from a unique approach combining\nsmall client batch sizes with extremely high learning rates, enabled by\nfederated averaging's robustness to hyperparameters.

In this sense, this manuscript\ndevelops an analytical submodel that represents the structural behaviour of the\nroller-wire-ring set, in order to include it later in a global FE model to\naccount for ring flexibility and boundary conditions. This way, the\ncomputationally intensive FE modelling of these complex zones can be\nsubstituted by the analytical model developed in this work, and a much\nmanageable global FE model can be used to predict the structural response of\nthe bearing.

We show that, if the\nneural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network\nrenders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical\nkernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\\epsilon_n$ is the\ncritical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the\nnetwork and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our\nresult does not require distributional assumptions about the covariate as long\nas the covariate is bounded, in a strong contrast with many existing results\nwhich rely on specific distributions of the covariates such as the spherical\nuniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive\nconditions. The rate $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal\nfor specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue\ndecay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions on the\ncovariates. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical\nkernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width\nneural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional\nassumptions on the bounded covariate.

    "abstract": "The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum\ntheory. To resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time is introduced in an\naccompanying paper, starting from the assumption that the treatment of time in\nphysics must agree with our cognition. The formalization has two components:\nsequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states\nis described in terms of $n$. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between\nevents in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which\n$t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between\npresent and past events. This approach leads to quantum evolution equations\nexpressed in terms of a continuous evolution parameter $\\sigma$, which\ninterpolates between discrete sequential times $n$. Rather than describing the\nevolution of the world at large, these evolution equations provide probabilites\nof a set of predefined outcomes in well-defined experimental contexts. When the\ncontext is designed to measure spatio-temporal position $(x,t)$, time $t$\nbecomes an observable with Heisenberg uncertainty $\\Delta t$ on the same\nfooting as $x$. The corresponding evolution equation attains the same symmetric\nform as that suggested by Stueckelberg in 1941. When the context is such that\nthe metric of space-time is measured, the corresponding evolution equation may\nbe seen as an expression of quantum gravity. In short, the aim of this paper is\nto propose a coherent conceptual basis for the treatment of time in evolution\nequations, in so doing clarifying their meaning and domain of validity.",

Here, we\ndemonstrate that the bending in piezoceramics can be induced by non-zero\ngradient of d31 acrcoss thickness direction. Our calculations show that in\nstandard perovskite piezoceramics, such as KNbO3, a 0.69% concentration of\noxygen vacancies results in a 6.3 pC/N change in d31 by inhibiting polarization\nrotation, which is sufficient to produce ultrahigh nominal strain in thin\nsamples. The gradients of defect concentration, composition, and stress can all\ncause sufficient inhomogeneity in the distribution of d31, leading to the\nbending effect. We propose several approaches to distinguish true\nelectric-induced strain from bending-induced effects.

    "abstract": "The equation of state (EOS) of extremely dense matter is crucial for\nunderstanding the properties of rotating neutron stars. Starting from the\nwidely used realistic Bonn potentials rooted in a relativistic framework, we\nderive EOSs by performing the state-of-the-art relativistic\nBrueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) calculations in the full Dirac space. The\nself-consistent and simultaneous consideration of both positive- and\nnegative-energy states (NESs) of the Dirac equation allows us to avoid the\nuncertainties present in calculations where NESs are treated using\napproximations. To manifest the impact of rotational dynamics, several\nstructural properties of neutron stars across a wide range of rotation\nfrequencies and up to the Keplerian limit are obtained, including the\ngravitational and baryonic masses, the polar and equatorial radii, and the\nmoments of inertia. Our theoretical predictions align well with the latest\nastrophysical constraints from the observations on massive neutron stars and\njoint mass-radius measurements. The maximum mass for rotating configurations\ncan reach up to $2.93M_{\\odot}$ for Bonn A potential, while the radius of a\n$1.4M_\\odot$ neutron star for non-rotating case can be extended to around 17 km\nthrough the constant baryonic mass sequences. Relations with good\nuniversalities between the Keplerian frequency and static mass as well as\nradius are obtained, from which the radius of the black widow PSR J0952-0607 is\npredicted to be less than 19.58 km. Furthermore, to understand how rotation\ndeforms the equilibrium shape of a neutron star, the eccentricity is also\ncalculated. The approximate universality between the eccentricity at the\nKeplerian frequency and the gravitational mass is found.",

Adversarial training has emerged as one of the most\neffective defensive techniques for improving model robustness against such\nmalicious inputs. However, existing adversarial training schemes often lead to\nlimited generalization ability against underlying adversaries with diversity\ndue to their overreliance on a point-by-point augmentation strategy by mapping\neach clean example to its adversarial counterpart during training. In addition,\nadversarial examples can induce significant disruptions in the statistical\ninformation w.r.t. the target model, thereby introducing substantial\nuncertainty and challenges to modeling the distribution of adversarial\nexamples. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel\nuncertainty-aware distributional adversarial training method, which enforces\nadversary modeling by leveraging both the statistical information of\nadversarial examples and its corresponding uncertainty estimation, with the\ngoal of augmenting the diversity of adversaries. Considering the potentially\nnegative impact induced by aligning adversaries to misclassified clean\nexamples, we also refine the alignment reference based on the statistical\nproximity to clean examples during adversarial training, thereby reframing\nadversarial training within a distribution-to-distribution matching framework\ninteracted between the clean and adversarial domains. Furthermore, we design an\nintrospective gradient alignment approach via matching input gradients between\nthese domains without introducing external models. Extensive experiments across\nfour benchmark datasets and various network architectures demonstrate that our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness and maintains natural\nperformance.",

We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using\ntwo- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between\nall qutrit states. At the magic angle, we probe the coherence achievable in\nmagic-angle-tuned traps and find atom-atom coherence times between the\nmetastable states as long as 715(30) ms.

To address the issues, we propose the first Data Manipulation aided\nReconstruction attack on GFL, dubbed as DMan4Rec. The malicious client is born\nto manipulate its locally collected data to enhance graph stealing privacy from\nbenign ones, so as to construct double whammy on GFL. It differs from previous\nwork in three terms: (1) effectiveness - to fully utilize the sparsity and\nfeature smoothness of the graph, novel penalty terms are designed adaptive to\ndiverse similarity functions for connected and unconnected node pairs, as well\nas incorporation label smoothing on top of the original cross-entropy loss. (2)\nscalability - DMan4Rec is capable of both white-box and black-box attacks via\ntraining a supervised model to infer the posterior probabilities obtained from\nlimited queries (3) stealthiness - by manipulating the malicious client's node\nfeatures, it can maintain the overall graph structure's invariance and conceal\nthe attack. Comprehensive experiments on four real datasets and three GNN\nmodels demonstrate that DMan4Rec achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack\nperformance, e.g., the attack AUC and precision improved by 9.2% and 10.5%\nrespectively compared with the SOTA baselines.

Nevertheless, the complete overlap of the distribution\ngraphs supports the stealthiness of the attack. Besides, DMan4Rec still beats\nthe defensive GFL, which alarms a new threat to GFL.",

Loop summarization, as a static analysis method for\nconcrete semantic interpretation, receives increasing focuses. It produces\nsymbolic expressions semantically equivalent to the loop program. However,\ncurrent loop summarization methods are only suitable for single-branch loops or\nmulti-branch loops with simple cycles, without supporting complex loops with\nirregular branch-to-branch transitions. In this paper, we proposed LoopSCC, a\nnovel loop summarization technique, to achieve concrete semantic interpretation\non complex loop. LoopSCC analyzes the control flow at the granularity of\nsingle-loop-path and applies the strongly connected components (SCC for short)\nfor contraction and simplification, resulting in the contracted\nsingle-loop-path graph (CSG for short). Based on the control flow information\nprovided by the CSG, we can convert the loop summary into a combination of SCC\nsummaries. When an SCC contains irregular branch-to-branch transitions, we\npropose to explore a convergent range to identify the determinate cycles of\ndifferent execution paths, referred as oscillatory interval. The loop\nsummarization composed of both iteration conditions and execution operations\ncan eventually be derived recursively. Extensive experiments compared to six\nstate-of-the-art loop interpretation methods are conducted to evaluate the\neffectiveness of LoopSCC. From the results, LoopSCC outperforms comparative\nmethods in both interpretation accuracy and application effectiveness.\nEspecially, LoopSCC achieves a 100% interpretation accuracy on public\ncommon-used benchmark. A systematical study for loop properties on three\nlarge-scale programs illustrates that LoopSCC presents outstanding scalability\nfor real-world loop programs.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate and efficient detectors for drone imagery is challenging\ndue to the inherent complexity of aerial scenes. While some existing methods\naim to achieve high accuracy by utilizing larger models, their computational\ncost is prohibitive for drones. Recently, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has shown\npromising potential for maintaining satisfactory accuracy while significantly\ncompressing models in general object detection. Considering the advantages of\nKD, this paper presents the first attempt to adapt it to object detection on\ndrone imagery and addresses two intrinsic issues: (1) low foreground-background\nratio and (2) small instances and complex backgrounds, which lead to inadequate\ntraining, resulting insufficient distillation. Therefore, we propose a\ntask-wise Lightweight Mutual Lifting (Light-ML) module with a Centerness-based\nInstance-aware Distillation (CID) strategy. The Light-ML module mutually\nharmonizes the classification and localization branches by channel shuffling\nand convolution, integrating teacher supervision across different tasks during\nback-propagation, thus facilitating training the student model. The CID\nstrategy extracts valuable regions surrounding instances through the centerness\nof proposals, enhancing distillation efficacy.

We address this through: (1) Extracting domain features from PMU\ntime series data; (2) Applying multi-scale windows (30s, 60s, 180s) for pattern\ndetection; (3) Using Recursive Feature Elimination to identify key features;\n(4) Training multiple machine learning models. Key contributions: Identifying\nsignificant features across multi-scale windows; Demonstrating LightGBM's\nsuperior performance (0.896 precision); Showing multi-scale analysis\noutperforms single-window models (0.841). Our work focuses on weather-related\nfailures, with plans to extend to equipment failure and lightning events.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive geoscientific downscaling model strategy is presented\noutlining an approach that has evolved over the last 20 years, together with an\nexplanation for its development, its technical aspects, and evaluation scheme.\nThis effort has resulted in an open-source and free R-based tool, 'esd', for\nthe benefit of sharing and improving the reproducibility of the downscaling\nresults. Furthermore, a set of new metrics was developed as an integral part of\nthe downscaling approach which assesses model performance with an emphasis on\nregional information for society (RifS). These metrics involve novel ways of\ncomparing model results with observational data and have been developed for\ndownscaling large multi-model global climate model ensembles. This paper\npresents for the first time an overview of the comprehensive framework adopted\nby the Norwegian Meteorological Institute for downscaling aimed at supporting\nclimate change adaptation. A literature search suggests that this comprehensive\ndownscaling strategy and evaluation scheme are not widely used within the\ndownscaling community. In addition, this strategy involves a new convention for\nstoring large datasets of ensemble results that provides fast access to\ninformation and drastically saves data volume.",

Meanwhile, the\nprivacy leakage of GNN in such contexts has also captured special attention.\nPrior work has revealed that a malicious user can utilize auxiliary knowledge\nto extract sensitive link data of the target graph, integral to recommendation\nsystems, via the decision made by the target GNN model. This poses a\nsignificant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of data used in\nrecommendation system.

To\naddress these issues, we propose a diffusion model based link stealing attack,\nnamed DM4Steal. It differs previous work from three critical aspects. (i)\nGenerality: aiming at six attack scenarios with limited auxiliary knowledge, we\npropose a novel training strategy for diffusion models so that DM4Steal is\ntransferable to diverse attack scenarios. (ii) Effectiveness: benefiting from\nthe retention of semantic structure in the diffusion model during the training\nprocess, DM4Steal is capable to learn the precise topology of the target graph\nthrough the GNN decision process.

We also demonstrate that our frameworks generalize most of the existing\ndomain-specific tractability results.\n  Our main technical breakthrough is introducing the notion of\n\\emph{max-distance sparsifier} of $\\mathcal{D}$, a domain on which the max-min\ndiversification problem is equivalent to the same problem on the original\ndomain $\\mathcal{D}$. The core of our framework is to design FPT oracle\nalgorithms that construct a constant-size max-distance sparsifier of\n$\\mathcal{D}$. Using max-distance sparsifiers, we provide FPT algorithms for\nthe max-min and max-sum diversification problems on $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as\n$k$-center and $k$-sum-of-radii clustering problems on $\\mathcal{D}$, which are\nalso natural problems in the context of diversification and have their own\ninterests.",

Through comprehensive\nexperiments using state-of-the-art models (DeepGaze IIE, Depth Anything,\nDPT-Large, and Itti's model) on COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, we find that\nvisual saliency shows consistently stronger correlations with object detection\naccuracy (mA$\\rho$ up to 0.459 on Pascal VOC) compared to depth prediction\n(mA$\\rho$ up to 0.283). Our analysis reveals significant variations in these\ncorrelations across object categories, with larger objects showing correlation\nvalues up to three times higher than smaller objects. These findings suggest\nincorporating visual saliency features into object detection architectures\ncould be more beneficial than depth information, particularly for specific\nobject categories.

Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image\nfusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential\ndeployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion\nwith a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution\nfrom a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of\nimage fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It\nprovably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we\ndecompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source\ndata. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the\nsource data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD)\nof the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we\nprove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative\ncorrelation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source\nreconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant\nregions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding\nfusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions\nwith in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and\nsuperiority. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yinan-Xia/TTD.",

The\nadiabatic passage is assisted by properly chosen spatial and temporal\nmodulations of the Rabi frequency. Within the framework of a few-mode\napproximation, the mechanism is enabled by a dark state created by coupling the\ninitial and target low-energy solitons with a high-energy extended Bloch state,\nlike in the conventional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage used for the\ncoherent control of quantum states. In real space, however, the atomic transfer\nbetween initial and target states is sustained by the current carried by the\nextended Bloch state which remains populated during the whole process. The full\ndescription of the transfer is provided by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\nProtocols for the adiabatic passage are described for one- and two-dimensional\noptical lattices, as well as for splitting and subsequent transfer of an\ninitial wavepacket simultaneously to two different target locations.",

However, it is challenging to deploy LLMs to provide efficient\nand adaptive inference services at the edge. This paper proposes a novel\nCloud-Edge Collaboration framework for LLMs (CE-CoLLM) to tackle these\nchallenges. First, we identify the transmission of LLM contextual data between\nthe cloud and edge as a key performance bottleneck, which introduces\nsubstantial communication overhead that dominates overall inference latency and\nmakes na\\\"ive cloud-edge collaboration for LLMs inefficient. Second, we\nintroduce a suite of novel techniques, including a latency-aware early exit\nmechanism and efficient cloud context management, into CE-CoLLM, which\ncollectively reduce communication overhead and preserve LLM inference accuracy.\nThird, we design two adaptive inference modes to accommodate diverse edge\nenvironments: (1) a low-latency standalone edge inference mode that enables\nreliable edge-side independent LLM inference even under unstable network\nconditions, and (2) a high-accuracy cloud-edge collaborative inference mode\nthat adaptively leverages cloud resources to enhance prediction accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CE-CoLLM\nreduces overall inference time by up to 13.81% and offloads over 84.53% of the\ncomputational workload from the cloud to the edge, compared to conventional\ncloud-based LLM deployment, without sacrificing prediction accuracy.

To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a\nVB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background\nmagnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate\nthe state of the nuclei with $\\hat{U}_z$ and $\\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These\nrotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and\nthe Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system\nparameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be\nexecuted with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application\nof our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly\nentangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$.\nBy including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative\ndeviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small,\nproving the noise-resilience of our protocols.

Such arc unavailability scenarios occur in routing and scheduling of\nthe instrumented wagons for inspection of railway tracks without disturbing the\ntrain schedules, i.e. the scheduled trains prohibit access to the signal blocks\n(sections of railway track separated by signals) for some finite interval of\ntime.\n  A three-index formulation for the RPP-TU is adopted from the literature.

Subsequently, we ask LLMs to\npredict this masked field. During inference, the user intent is converted into\na CAD text with a mask token replacing the part the user wants to modify, which\nis then fed into FlexCAD to generate new CAD models. Comprehensive experiments\non public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexCAD in both generation\nquality and controllability.

On\nthe other hand, several applications of prompt-based generative models require\nsufficient diversity in the generated data to ensure the models' capability of\ngenerating image and video samples possessing a variety of features. However,\nmost existing diversity metrics are designed for unconditional generative\nmodels, and thus cannot distinguish the diversity arising from variations in\ntext prompts and that contributed by the generative model itself. In this work,\nour goal is to quantify the prompt-induced and model-induced diversity in\nsamples generated by prompt-based models. We propose an information-theoretic\napproach for internal diversity quantification, where we decompose the\nkernel-based entropy $H(X)$ of the generated data $X$ into the sum of the\nconditional entropy $H(X|T)$, given text variable $T$, and the mutual\ninformation $I(X; T)$ between the text and data variables. We introduce the\n\\emph{Conditional-Vendi} score based on $H(X|T)$ to quantify the internal\ndiversity of the model and the \\emph{Information-Vendi} score based on $I(X;\nT)$ to measure the statistical relevance between the generated data and text\nprompts. We provide theoretical results to statistically interpret these scores\nand relate them to the unconditional Vendi score.

It offers\npersonalized feedback, enhances accessibility, enables interactive\nconversations, assists with lesson preparation and evaluation, and introduces\nnew methods for teaching complex subjects. However, ChatGPT also poses\nchallenges to traditional education and research systems. These challenges\ninclude the risk of cheating on online exams, the generation of human-like text\nthat may compromise academic integrity, a potential decline in critical\nthinking skills, and difficulties in assessing the reliability of information\ngenerated by AI. This study examines both the opportunities and challenges\nChatGPT brings to education from the perspectives of students and educators.\nSpecifically, it explores the role of ChatGPT in helping students develop their\nsubjective skills. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conducted several\nsubjective experiments using ChatGPT, such as generating solutions from\nsubjective problem descriptions. Additionally, surveys were conducted with\nstudents and teachers to gather insights into how ChatGPT supports subjective\nlearning and teaching. The results and analysis of these surveys are presented\nto highlight the impact of ChatGPT in this context.",

Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory\nof an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate\nan asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over\ndecades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their\npotential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage.

However, the\ndistributed data silos limit the performance of GNN. Vertical federated\nlearning (VFL), an emerging technique to process distributed data, successfully\nmakes GNN possible to handle the distributed graph-structured data. Despite the\nprosperous development of vertical federated graph learning (VFGL), the\nrobustness of VFGL against the adversarial attack has not been explored yet.\nAlthough numerous adversarial attacks against centralized GNNs are proposed,\ntheir attack performance is challenged in the VFGL scenario. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to explore the adversarial attack against\nVFGL. A query-efficient hybrid adversarial attack framework is proposed to\nsignificantly improve the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, denoted\nas NA2, short for Neuron-based Adversarial Attack. Specifically, a malicious\nclient manipulates its local training data to improve its contribution in a\nstealthy fashion. Then a shadow model is established based on the manipulated\ndata to simulate the behavior of the server model in VFGL. As a result, the\nshadow model can improve the attack success rate of various centralized attacks\nwith a few queries. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks\ndemonstrate that NA2 improves the performance of the centralized adversarial\nattacks against VFGL, achieving state-of-the-art performance even under\npotential adaptive defense where the defender knows the attack method.\nAdditionally, we provide interpretable experiments of the effectiveness of NA2\nvia sensitive neurons identification and visualization of t-SNE.",

Courtesy of contemporary\nresearch on laser attacks, laser-based fault injection (LFI) is becoming even\nmore precise where an adversary can thwart chip security by altering individual\nflip-flop (FF) values. Different laser models, e.g., bit flip, bit set, and bit\nreset, have been developed to appreciate LFI on practical targets. As\ntraditional approaches may incorporate substantial overhead, state-based SPARSE\nand transition-based TAMED countermeasures were proposed in our prior work to\nimprove FSM resiliency efficiently. TAMED overcame SPARSE's limitation of being\ntoo conservative, and generating multiple LFI resilient encodings for\ncontemporary LFI models on demand. SPARSE, however, incorporated design layout\ninformation into its vulnerability estimation which makes its vulnerability\nestimation metric more accurate. In this paper, we extend TAMED by proposing a\ntransition-based encoding CAD framework (TRANSPOSE), that incorporates spatial\ntransitional vulnerability metrics to quantify design susceptibility of FSMs\nbased on both the bit flip model and the set-reset models. TRANSPOSE also\nincorporates floorplan optimization into its framework to accommodate secure\nspatial inter-distance of FF-sensitive regions.

Unlike the general scene, detecting text in\ntransportation has extra demand, such as a fast inference speed, except for\nhigh accuracy. Most existing real-time text detection methods are based on the\nshrink mask, which loses some geometry semantic information and needs complex\npost-processing. In addition, the previous method usually focuses on correct\noutput, which ignores feature correction and lacks guidance during the\nintermediate process. To this end, we propose an efficient multi-scene text\ndetector that contains an effective text representation similar mask (SM) and a\nfeature correction module (FCM).

Its\npost-progressing saves 50$\\%$ of the time, accurately and efficiently\nreconstructing text contours. The latter encourages false positive features to\nmove away from the positive feature center, optimizing the predictions from the\nfeature level. Some ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of the SM and\nthe effectiveness of the FCM. Moreover, the deficiency of existing traffic\ndatasets (such as the low-quality annotation or closed source data\nunavailability) motivated us to collect and annotate a traffic text dataset,\nwhich introduces motion blur.

We generate multiple translation\ncandidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently\ntranslate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the\ncycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using\nmetrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the\ntranslation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth.

For each source sentence, we identify the translation candidate with\noptimal cycle consistency with the original sentence as the final answer. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that larger LLMs, or the same LLM with more forward\npasses during inference, exhibit increased cycle consistency, aligning with the\nLLM model size scaling law and test-time computation scaling law.

However, in some scenarios, a robot needs to\nselectively localize when it is expensive to obtain observations. For example,\nan underwater robot surfacing to localize too often hinders it from searching\nfor critical items underwater, such as black boxes from crashed aircraft. On\nthe other hand, if the robot never localizes, poor state estimates cause\nfailure to find the items due to inadvertently leaving the search area or\nentering hazardous, restricted areas. Motivated by these scenarios, we\ninvestigate approaches to help a robot determine \"when to localize?\" We\nformulate this as a bi-criteria optimization problem: minimize the number of\nlocalization actions while ensuring the probability of failure (due to\ncollision or not reaching a desired goal) remains bounded. In recent work, we\nshowed how to formulate this active localization problem as a constrained\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which was solved using an\nonline POMDP solver. However, this approach is too slow and requires full\nknowledge of the robot transition and observation models. In this paper, we\npresent RiskRL, a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that\novercomes these limitations. RiskRL uses particle filtering and recurrent Soft\nActor-Critic network to learn a policy that minimizes the number of\nlocalizations while ensuring the probability of failure constraint is met. Our\nnumerical experiments show that RiskRL learns a robust policy that leads to at\nleast a 26% increase in success rates when traversing unseen test environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper began as a set of notes introducing quantum physicists of the\nQBist persuasion to enactive theory. Unlike mainstream cognitive science, which\nviews cognition as computations on internal representations of the external\nworld (and thus the mind as in the head), the enactive approach sees cognition\nas adaptive, embodied action. Enaction can ground concepts of experience,\nagency, knowledge, and normativity - which play key roles in QBist quantum\nmechanics - in terms consistent with QBism's participatory approach. That's\nbecause QBism and enaction both reject an absolute, pregiven subject-object\nsplit: for QBism, quantum measurement is the enactment of the subject-object\ndivide; for enaction, cognition is the enactment of that divide.

In response, a growing body of work has\nbeen investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various\njailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak\nmethods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and\neffort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or\nsophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the\ninput prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs,\nsuch as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different\nmodels and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations\nwith multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization,\nfine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling\ntemperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e.\n$\\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of\nbypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.

Here we disentangle\nhow much of the reconstruction is due to these other factors vs. productively\nusing the neural recordings. We introduce BrainBits, a method that uses a\nbottleneck to quantify the amount of signal extracted from neural recordings\nthat is actually necessary to reproduce a method's reconstruction fidelity. We\nfind that it takes surprisingly little information from the brain to produce\nreconstructions with high fidelity. In these cases, it is clear that the priors\nof the methods' generative models are so powerful that the outputs they produce\nextrapolate far beyond the neural signal they decode. Given that reconstructing\nstimuli can be improved independently by either improving signal extraction\nfrom the brain or by building more powerful generative models, improving the\nlatter may fool us into thinking we are improving the former. We propose that\nmethods should report a method-specific random baseline, a reconstruction\nceiling, and a curve of performance as a function of bottleneck size, with the\nultimate goal of using more of the neural recordings.",

We introduce a general framework, calibrated\ndebiased machine learning (calibrated DML), and propose a specific estimator\nthat augments standard DML with a simple isotonic regression adjustment. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the calibrated DML estimator remains\nasymptotically normal if either the regression or the Riesz representer of the\nfunctional is estimated sufficiently well, allowing the other to converge\narbitrarily slowly or even inconsistently. We further propose a simple\nbootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals, enabling doubly robust\ninference without additional nuisance estimation. In a range of semi-synthetic\nbenchmark datasets, calibrated DML reduces bias and improves coverage relative\nto standard DML. Our method can be integrated into existing DML pipelines by\nadding just a few lines of code to calibrate cross-fitted estimates via\nisotonic regression.",

    "abstract": "Rahimi and Recht (2007) introduced the idea of decomposing positive definite\nshift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution.\nThis famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle\napplicable to any such kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and\nsimulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel\nbecause of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian.\nClearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader\nclasses of kernels. In this paper, we show that the spectral distribution of\npositive definite isotropic kernels in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for all $d\\geq1$ can be\ndecomposed as a scale mixture of $\\alpha$-stable random vectors, and we\nidentify the mixing distribution as a function of the kernel. This constructive\ndecomposition provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for\nmany multivariate positive definite shift-invariant kernels, including\nexponential power kernels, generalized Mat\\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy\nkernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and\nTricomi kernels. In particular, we retrieve the fact that the spectral\ndistributions of these kernels are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution, along with an explicit mixing distribution formula. This result\nhas broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression,\nGaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for\nwhich the random Fourier features technique is applicable.",

Here, we apply a novel nonparametric approach to identifying\nnonlinear relations using partial distance correlations.

Through simulation\nstudies and an empirical example, we show that partial distance correlations as\na novel method can be used to identify possible nonlinear relations in\npsychometric networks, enabling researchers to then explore the shape of these\nrelations with more confirmatory models.",

A promising optimization approach is to\nleverage the intrinsic physical characteristics of targets, which remain\ninvariable regardless of environmental conditions, to provide robust insights.\nHowever, our study reveals that while physical characteristics exhibit robust\nproperties, they may lack class-specific discriminative patterns. Consequently,\ndirectly incorporating physical characteristics into model training can\npotentially introduce unintended inductive biases, leading to performance\ndegradation. To utilize the benefits of physical characteristics while\nmitigating possible detrimental effects, we propose DEMONet in this study,\nwhich utilizes the detection of envelope modulation on noise (DEMON) to provide\nrobust insights into the shaft frequency or blade counts of targets. DEMONet is\na multi-expert network that allocates various underwater signals to their\nbest-matched expert layer based on DEMON spectra for fine-grained signal\nprocessing. Thereinto, DEMON spectra are solely responsible for providing\nimplicit physical characteristics without establishing a mapping relationship\nwith the target category. Furthermore, to mitigate noise and spurious\nmodulation spectra in DEMON features, we introduce a cross-temporal alignment\nstrategy and employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct\nnoise-resistant DEMON spectra to replace the raw DEMON features.

    "abstract": "This paper considers a patrol inspection scenario where multiple unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) are adopted to traverse multiple predetermined cruise\npoints for data collection. The UAVs are connected to cellular networks and\nthey would offload the collected data to the ground base stations (GBSs) for\ndata processing within the constrained duration. This paper proposes a balanced\ntask assignment strategy among patrol UAVs and an energy-efficient trajectory\ndesign method. Through jointly optimizing the cruise point assignment,\ncommunication scheduling, computational allocation, and UAV trajectory, a novel\nsolution can be obtained to balance the multiple UAVs' task completion time and\nminimize the total energy consumption. Firstly, we propose a novel clustering\nmethod that considers geometry topology, communication rate, and offload\nvolume; it can determine each UAV's cruise points and balance the UAVs' patrol\ntask. Secondly, a hybrid Time-Energy traveling salesman problem is formulated\nto analyze the cruise point traversal sequence, and the energy-efficient UAV\ntrajectory can be designed by adopting the successive convex approximation\n(SCA) technique and block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. The numerical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed balanced task assignment strategy can\nefficiently balance the multiple UAVs' tasks. Moreover, the min-max task\ncompletion time and total energy consumption performance of the proposed\nsolution outperform that of the current conventional approach.",

    "abstract": "The attached-eddy model (AEM) predicts mean velocity and streamwise velocity\nvariance profiles that follow a logarithmic shape in the overlap region of high\nReynolds number wall-bounded turbulent flows. Moreover, the AEM coefficients\nare presumed to attain asymptotically constant values at very high Reynolds\nnumbers. Here, the logarithmic behaviour of the AEM predictions in the\nnear-neutral atmospheric surface layer is examined using sonic anemometer\nmeasurements from a 62-m meteorological tower located in the Eastern Snake\nRiver Plain, Idaho, US. Utilizing an extensive 210-day dataset, the inertial\nsublayer (ISL) is first identified by analyzing the measured momentum flux and\nmean velocity profile. The logarithmic behaviour of the streamwise velocity\nvariance and the associated `-1' scaling of the streamwise velocity energy\nspectra are then investigated. The findings indicate that the Townsend-Perry\ncoefficient ($A_1$) is influenced by mild non-stationarity that manifests\nitself as a Reynolds number dependence. After excluding non-stationary runs and\nrequiring a Reynolds number higher than $4 \\times 10^7$, the inferred $A_1$\nconverges to values ranging between 1 and 1.25, consistent with laboratory\nexperiments. Moreover, the independence of the normalized vertical velocity\nvariance from the wall-normal distance in the ISL is further checked and the\nconstant coefficient value agrees with reported laboratory experiments at very\nhigh Reynolds numbers as well as many surface layer experiments. Furthermore,\nnine benchmark cases selected through a restrictive quality control reveal a\ncloser relationship between the `-1' scaling in the streamwise velocity energy\nspectrum and the logarithmic behaviour of streamwise velocity variance at\nhigher Reynolds numbers, though no direct equivalence between them is observed.",

Following the spirit don't use a sledgehammer on a nut, we find\nthat, rather than creating annotations from scratch, radiologists only have to\nreview and edit errors if the Best-AI Labels have mistakes. To obtain the\nBest-AI Labels among multiple AI Labels, we developed an automatic tool, called\nLabel Critic, that can assess label quality through tireless pairwise\ncomparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when incorporated with our\ndeveloped Image-Prompt pairs, pre-existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM),\ntrained on natural images and texts, achieve 96.5% accuracy when choosing the\nbest label in a pair-wise comparison, without extra fine-tuning. By\ntransforming the manual annotation task (30-60 min/scan) into an automatic\ncomparison task (15 sec/scan), we effectively reduce the manual efforts\nrequired from radiologists by an order of magnitude. When the Best-AI Labels\nare sufficiently accurate (81% depending on body structures), they will be\ndirectly adopted as the gold-standard annotations for the dataset, with\nlower-quality AI Labels automatically discarded.

Furthermore, existing algorithms primarily focus on a single\npermutation, leaving many combinatorial problems involving multiple constrained\npermutations unaddressed.\n  For a single permutation, we achieve the optimal running time $O(n^2)$ for\napproximating the permanent of a very dense $n \\times n$ 0-1 matrix, where each\nrow and column contains at most $\\sqrt{(n-2)/20}$ zeros. This result serves as\na fundamental building block in our sampling algorithm for multiple\npermutations.\n  We further introduce a general model called permutations with disjunctive\nconstraints (PDC) for handling multiple constrained permutations. We propose a\nnovel Markov chain-based algorithm for sampling nearly uniform solutions of PDC\nwithin a lopsided Lov\\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) regime. For uniform PDC formulas,\nwhere all constraints are of the same width and all permutations are of the\nsame size, our algorithm runs in nearly linear time with respect to the number\nof variables.\n  Previous approaches for sampling LLL relied on the variable model. In\ncontrast, the sampling problem of PDC encounters a fundamental challenge: the\nrandom variables within each permutation in the joint probability space are not\nmutually independent, leading to long-range correlations. To tackle this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel sampling framework called correlated\nfactorization and a new concept in the path coupling analysis, termed the\ninactive vertex.",

However, these methods predominantly rely on progressive\ncross-scale feature aggregation and focus solely on local information, which\nmay result in a lack of global awareness and the omission of small-scale\nobjects. In addition, due to large variation in object scales across different\nscenes and depths, inaccurate receptive fields often lead to background noise\nand degraded feature representation. To address these issues, we introduces\nMonoASRH, a novel monocular 3D detection framework composed of Efficient Hybrid\nFeature Aggregation Module (EH-FAM) and Adaptive Scale-Aware 3D Regression Head\n(ASRH). Specifically, EH-FAM employs multi-head attention with a global\nreceptive field to extract semantic features for small-scale objects and\nleverages lightweight convolutional modules to efficiently aggregate visual\nfeatures across different scales. The ASRH encodes 2D bounding box dimensions\nand then fuses scale features with the semantic features aggregated by EH-FAM\nthrough a scale-semantic feature fusion module. The scale-semantic feature\nfusion module guides ASRH in learning dynamic receptive field offsets,\nincorporating scale priors into 3D position prediction for better\nscale-awareness.

Such\nmodels could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models,\nwhich is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to\ntasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to\nachieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on\nprogress, challenges, and opportunities.

This quantum cryptographic primitive was first\nintroduced by Gottesman in 2003. Beyond formally defining this security notion,\nGottesman's work had three main contributions: showing that any quantum\nauthentication scheme is also a tamper-evident scheme, noting that a quantum\nkey distribution scheme can be constructed from any tamper-evident scheme, and\nconstructing a prepare-and-measure tamper-evident scheme using only Wiesner\nstates inspired by Shor and Preskill's proof of security for the BB84 quantum\nkey distribution scheme.\n  In this work, we further our understanding of tamper-evident encryption by\nformally relating it to other quantum cryptographic primitives in an\ninformation-theoretic setting. In particular, we show that tamper evidence\nimplies encryption, answering a question left open by Gottesman, we show that\nit can be constructed from any encryption scheme with revocation and\nvice-versa, and we formalize an existing sketch of a construction of quantum\nmoney from any tamper-evident encryption scheme. These results also yield as a\ncorollary that any scheme allowing the revocation of a message must be an\nencryption scheme. We also show separations between tamper evidence and other\nprimitives, notably showing that tamper evidence does not imply authentication\nand does not imply uncloneable encryption.",

High-frequency Fe K and soft lags are\nconsidered to originate from the light-travel distances between the corona and\nthe accretion disk, while the propagation of the inward mass accretion\nfluctuation usually explains the low-frequency hard lags. Ultra-fast outflows\n(UFOs), with a velocity range of 0.03-0.3c, have also been discovered in\nnumerous AGN and are believed to be launched from the inner accretion disk.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether UFOs can affect the X-ray time lags. As a\npilot work, we aim to investigate the potential influence of UFOs on X-ray time\nlags of AGN in a small sample. By performing the UFO-resolved Fourier spectral\ntiming analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations of three AGN with transient\nUFOs: PG 1448+273, IRAS 13224-3809, and PG 1211+143, we compare their X-ray\ntiming products, such as lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra, of observations\nwith and without UFO obscuration. Our results find that in each AGN,\nlow-frequency hard lags become weak or even disappear when they are accompanied\nby UFOs. In the high-frequency domain, soft lags remain unchanged while the Fe\nK reverberation lags tentatively disappear. The comparison between timing\nproducts of low- and high-flux observations on another three AGN without UFOs\n(Ark 564, NGC 7469, and Mrk 335) suggests that the disappearance of\nlow-frequency hard lags is likely related to the emergence of UFOs, not\nnecessarily related to the source flux. We conclude that the presence of UFOs\ncan affect X-ray time lags of AGN by suppressing the low-frequency hard lags,\nwhich can be explained by an additional time delay introduced by UFOs or disk\naccretion energy carried away by UFOs.",

To an indivisible positive root\n$\\alpha$ and a non-negative integer $d$, one associates a quotient $\\bar\nR_{d\\alpha}$ of $R_{d\\alpha}$ called the cuspidal algebra. If the root $\\alpha$\nis real, the cuspidal algebra is well-understood. But if $\\alpha=\\delta$, the\nimaginary null-root, the {\\em imaginary cuspidal algebra} $\\bar R_{d\\delta}$ is\nrather mysterious. It has been known that the number of the isomorphism classes\nof the irreducible $\\bar R_{d\\delta}$-modules equals the number of the\n$\\ell$-multipartitions of $d$, but there has been no way to canonically\nassociate an irreducible $\\bar R_{d\\delta}$-module to such a multipartiton. The\nimaginary cuspidal algebra is especially important because of its connections\nto the RoCK blocks of the double covers of symmetric and alternating groups. We\nundertake a detailed study of the imaginary cuspidal algebra and its\nrepresentation theory. We use the so-called Gelfand-Graev idempotents and\nsubtle degree and parity shifts to construct a (graded) Morita\n(super)equivalent algebra $\\mathsf{C}(n,d)$ (for any $n\\geq d$). The advantage\nof the algebra $\\mathsf{C}(n,d)$ is that, unlike $\\bar R_{d\\delta}$, it is\nnon-negatively graded. Moreover, the degree zero component $\\mathsf{C}(n,d)^0$\nis shown to be isomorphic to the direct sum of tensor products of $\\ell$ copies\nof the classical Schur algebras. This gives the classification (and the\ndescription of dimensions/characters, etc.) of the irreducible\n$\\mathsf{C}(n,d)$-modules, and hence of the irreducible $\\bar\nR_{d\\delta}$-modules, in terms of the classical Schur algebras. In particular,\nthis allows us to canonically label these by the $\\ell$-multipartitions of $d$.\nThe results of this paper will be used in our future work on RoCK blocks of the\ndouble covers of symmetric groups.",

Finally, we develop a remote sensing LVLMs\nhallucination evaluation method RSPOPE based on the proposed dataset and\nevaluate the zero-shot capabilities of different LVLMs. Our proposed dataset,\ninstruction set, and evaluation method files are available at\nhttps://github.com/HaodongLi2024/rspope.",

Here,\nwe employed the recently developed attomicroscopy imaging tool to investigate,\nvisualize, and manipulate the motion of bound electrons in graphene.

    "abstract": "Biomedical research requires large, diverse samples to produce unbiased\nresults. Automated methods for matching variables across datasets can\naccelerate this process. Research in this area has been limited, primarily\nfocusing on lexical matching and ontology based semantic matching. We aimed to\ndevelop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLM) and ensemble\nlearning, to automate variable matching. Methods: We utilized data from two\nGERAS cohort (European and Japan) studies to develop variable matching methods.\nWe first manually created a dataset by matching 352 EU variables with 1322\ncandidate JP variables, where matched variable pairs were positive and\nunmatched pairs were negative instances. Using this dataset, we developed and\nevaluated two types of natural language processing (NLP) methods, which matched\nvariables based on variable labels and definitions from data dictionaries: (1)\nLLM-based and (2) fuzzy matching. We then developed an ensemble-learning\nmethod, using the Random Forest model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF\nwas trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of\ntraining and test sets, with the model's hyperparameters optimized through\ncross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP\nvariables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF's\nprobability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking\nperformance was measured by top-n hit ratio (HRn) and mean reciprocal rank\n(MRR). Results:E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.90 HR-30\nand 0.70 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials (P less\nthan 0.001) and achieved an average HR 30 of 0.98 and MRR of 0.73. LLM-derived\nfeatures contributed most to RF's performance. One major cause of errors in\nautomatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions within data\ndictionaries.",

Here we present a comprehensive study of\nthe variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep\nfields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all\npublicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with\nmulti-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance\n(signal-to-noise ratio or ${\\rm SNR}_{\\rm var}$) of the variabilities for all\nLRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the ${\\rm SNR}_{\\rm\nvar}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of\nphotometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The\nderived ${\\rm SNR}_{\\rm var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with\nbroad H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian\ndistribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples\nof objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD\npopulation on average does not show strong variability, which can be explained\nby super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of\nthem may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD\ncandidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 -- 0.82 mag. The rest-frame\noptical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution.\nFuture JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.",

The task of high-precision retinal vessel\nsegmentation still faces difficulties due to the low contrast between the\nbranch ends of retinal vessels and the background, the long and thin vessel\nspan, and the variable morphology of the optic disc and optic cup in fundus\nvessel images. Methods: We propose a more advanced U-shaped architecture for a\nhybrid Transformer and CNN: TransUNext, which integrates an Efficient\nSelf-attention Mechanism into the encoder and decoder of U-Net to capture both\nlocal features and global dependencies with minimal computational overhead.\nMeanwhile, the Global Multi-Scale Fusion (GMSF) module is further introduced to\nupgrade skip-connections, fuse high-level semantic and low-level detailed\ninformation, and eliminate high- and low-level semantic differences.

We find an\n''LM cloud length'', a single length scale characterizing a universal form of\nthe LM cloud. The findings are supported by both of analytic theories and\nnumerical computations.",

However, traditional diagnosis methods face\nchallenges due to the diversification of application environments, including\ncross-condition adaptability, small-sample learning difficulties, and\ncross-dataset generalization. These challenges have hindered the effectiveness\nand limited the application of existing approaches. Large language models\n(LLMs) offer new possibilities for improving the generalization of diagnosis\nmodels. However, the integration of LLMs with traditional diagnosis techniques\nfor optimal generalization remains underexplored. This paper proposed an\nLLM-based bearing fault diagnosis framework to tackle these challenges. First,\na signal feature quantification method was put forward to address the issue of\nextracting semantic information from vibration data, which integrated time and\nfrequency domain feature extraction based on a statistical analysis framework.\nThis method textualized time-series data, aiming to efficiently learn\ncross-condition and small-sample common features through concise feature\nselection. Fine-tuning methods based on LoRA and QLoRA were employed to enhance\nthe generalization capability of LLMs in analyzing vibration data features. In\naddition, the two innovations (textualizing vibration features and fine-tuning\npre-trained models) were validated by single-dataset cross-condition and\ncross-dataset transfer experiment with complete and limited data. The results\ndemonstrated the ability of the proposed framework to perform three types of\ngeneralization tasks simultaneously. Trained cross-dataset models got\napproximately a 10% improvement in accuracy, proving the adaptability of LLMs\nto input patterns. Ultimately, the results effectively enhance the\ngeneralization capability and fill the research gap in using LLMs for bearing\nfault diagnosis.",

However, existing studies have concentrated mainly on\nvisual-textual misalignment, leaving largely unexplored the MLLMs' ability to\npreserve an originally correct answer when confronted with misleading\ninformation. We reveal a response uncertainty phenomenon: across nine standard\ndatasets, twelve state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs overturn a previously\ncorrect answer in 65% of cases after receiving a single deceptive cue. To\nsystematically quantify this vulnerability, we propose a two-stage evaluation\npipeline: (1) elicit each model's original response on unperturbed inputs; (2)\ninject explicit (false-answer hints) and implicit (contextual contradictions)\nmisleading instructions, and compute the misleading rate - the fraction of\ncorrect-to-incorrect flips. Leveraging the most susceptible examples, we curate\nthe Multimodal Uncertainty Benchmark (MUB), a collection of image-question\npairs stratified into low, medium, and high difficulty based on how many of\ntwelve state-of-the-art MLLMs they mislead. Extensive evaluation on twelve\nopen-source and five closed-source models reveals a high uncertainty: average\nmisleading rates exceed 86%, with explicit cues over 67.19% and implicit cues\nover 80.67%. To reduce the misleading rate, we then fine-tune all open-source\nMLLMs on a compact 2000-sample mixed-instruction dataset, reducing misleading\nrates to 6.97% (explicit) and 32.77% (implicit), boosting consistency by nearly\n29.37% on highly deceptive inputs, and slightly improving accuracy on standard\nbenchmarks.

We propose conditioning policies on affordances, which capture the\npose of the robot at key stages of the task. Affordances offer expressive yet\nlightweight abstractions, are easy for users to specify, and facilitate\nefficient learning by transferring knowledge from large internet datasets. Our\nmethod, RT-Affordance, is a hierarchical model that first proposes an\naffordance plan given the task language, and then conditions the policy on this\naffordance plan to perform manipulation. Our model can flexibly bridge\nheterogeneous sources of supervision including large web datasets and robot\ntrajectories. We additionally train our model on cheap-to-collect in-domain\naffordance images, allowing us to learn new tasks without collecting any\nadditional costly robot trajectories. We show on a diverse set of novel tasks\nhow RT-Affordance exceeds the performance of existing methods by over 50%, and\nwe empirically demonstrate that affordances are robust to novel settings.\nVideos available at https://snasiriany.me/rt-affordance",

However, in compressed spectrum sensing, challenges such as\nspectrum leakage and the picket-fence effect significantly complicate the\naccurate extraction of super-resolution signal components. Additionally, the\npractical implementation of random sampling poses a significant hurdle to the\nwidespread adoption of compressed spectrum sensing techniques. To overcome\nthese challenges, this study introduces a generalized eigenvalue method that\nleverages the incoherence between signal components and the\nlinearity-preserving characteristics of differential operations.

The\nproposed technique is founded on uniform sub-Nyquist sampling, which represents\na true sub-Nyquist approach and effectively mitigates the complexities\nassociated with hardware implementation. Furthermore, the proposed method\ndiverges from traditional compressed sensing techniques by operating outside\nthe discrete Fourier transform framework. This departure successfully\neliminates spectral leakage and the picket-fence effect. Moreover, it\nsubstantially reduces the detrimental impacts of random sampling on signal\nreconstruction and hardware implementation, thereby enhancing the overall\neffectiveness and feasibility of spectral super-resolution sensing.",

While previous study focused on low-redshift, FRBs are\npotentially detectable out to high redshift, where their DMs can, in principle,\nprobe the epoch of reionization (EOR) and its patchiness. We present the first\npredictions from large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of\nfully-coupled galaxy formation and reionization, using Cosmic Dawn (``CoDa\")~II\nto model the density and ionization fields of the universe down to redshifts\nthrough the end of the EOR at $z_{re}\\approx6.1$. Combining this with an N-body\nsimulation CoDa~II--Dark Matter of the fully-ionized epoch from the EOR to the\npresent, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of FRB DMs as functions\nof their source redshift. The mean and standard deviation of DM increase with\nredshift, reaching a plateau by $z(x_{HII}\\lesssim0.25)\\gtrsim8$, i.e. well\nabove $z_{re}$. The mean-DM asymptote $\\mathcal{DM}_{max} \\approx\n5900~\\mathrm{pc\\, cm^{-3}}$ reflects the end of the EOR and its duration.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have gained popularity for their ability to organize and\nanalyze complex data effectively. When combined with graph embedding\ntechniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), knowledge graphs become a\npotent tool in providing valuable insights. This study explores the application\nof graph embedding in identifying competitors from a financial knowledge graph.\nExisting state-of-the-art(SOTA) models face challenges due to the unique\nattributes of our knowledge graph, including directed and undirected\nrelationships, attributed nodes, and minimal annotated competitor connections.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel graph embedding model,\nJPEC(JPMorgan Proximity Embedding for Competitor Detection), which utilizes\ngraph neural network to learn from both first-order and second-order node\nproximity together with vital features for competitor retrieval. JPEC had\noutperformed most existing models in extensive experiments, showcasing its\neffectiveness in competitor retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Metallic glass is a frozen liquid with structural disorder that retains\ndegenerate free energy without spontaneous symmetry breaking to become a solid.\nFor over half a century, this puzzling structure has raised fundamental\nquestions about how structural disorder impacts glass-liquid phase transition\nkinetics, which remain elusive without direct evidence. In this study, through\nsingle-pulse, time-resolved imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers, we\nvisualized the glass-to-liquid transition, revealing a previously hidden\ndormant phase that does not involve any macroscopic volume change within the\ncrossover regime between the two phases. Although macroscopically inactive,\nnanoscale redistribution occurs, forming channeld low-density bands within this\ndormant phase that drives the glass transition. By providing direct microscopic\nevidence, this work presents a new perspective on the phase transition process\nin disordered materials, which can be extended to various liquid and solid\nphases in other complex systems.",

In this study, we graphically discuss the\neigenfunctions and eigenenergies of the Klein-Gordon equation with a\nYukawa-type potential (YP), within a position-dependent mass (PDM) framework.\nWe conclude that the PDM leads to the equivalence of the positive ($E^+$) and\nnegative ($E^-$) solution states at low energies. We observe that in the energy\nspectrum as a function of $\\eta$ (YP intensity factor), the PDM can induce gap\nclosure at the critical point where $E^+$ and $E^-$ become imaginary. In the\nspectrum as a function of $\\alpha$ (YP shielding factor), it can compel the\nenergies to be zero at $\\alpha=0$, instead of being equal to $(m_0c^2)$ as in\nthe invariant mass case.",

The aim of the paper is to study $\\mathsf{WL}(X)$ when $X$ is a\nCartesian product of graphs. The example of a Hamming graph shows that, in\ngeneral, $\\mathsf{WL}(X)$ does not coincide with the tensor product of the\ncoherent configurations of the factors. We prove that if $X$ is ``closed'' with\nrespect to the $6$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, then\n$\\mathsf{WL}(X)$ is the tensor product of the coherent configurations of\ncertain graphs related to the prime decomposition of $X$. This condition is\ntrivially satisfied for almost all graphs. In addition, we prove that the\nproperty of a graph ``to be decomposable into a Cartesian product of $k$\nconnected prime graphs'' for some $k\\ge 1$ is recognized by the $m$-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Leman algorithm for all $m\\ge 6$.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such\nas supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable\ninstruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing\ncapabilities learned during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the\nloss of context awareness after SFT, where context awareness is defined as the\nability to extract and understand information from user-provided context and\nrespond accordingly. We identify and demonstrate that the loss of context\nawareness, particularly in open-source models, occurs in instruction fine-tuned\nLLMs when the chat template is applied to input prompts. We identify that the\nperformance decline is associated with a bias toward different roles learned\nduring conversational instruction fine-tuning. We demonstrate this correlation\nby visualizing changes in attention allocation after the chat template is\napplied and manually steering the attention heads. The bias can be learned from\ntraining examples that align with the model's internal knowledge and rely less\non the user-provided context to generate correct responses. Based on these\nobservations, we propose a metric to identify context-dependent examples from\ngeneral instruction fine-tuning datasets. We then apply conditional instruction\nfine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator, enabling the model to preserve\ncontext awareness after SFT. Empirical experiments on four context-dependent\ndownstream tasks and three pre-trained LLMs of different sizes show that our\nmethod effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising\ngeneral instruction-following capabilities.",

We conducted extensive\nbenchmarking tests comparing SPINEX_SymbolicRegression to over 180 mathematical\nbenchmarking functions from international problem sets that span randomly\ngenerated expressions and those based on real physical phenomena. Then, we\nevaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy,\nexpression similarity in terms of presence operators and variables (as compared\nto the actual expressions), population size, and number of generations at\nconvergence. The results indicate that SPINEX_SymbolicRegression consistently\nperforms well and can, in some instances, outperform leading algorithms.

Yet, despite decades of research, the physical\nmechanisms that determine their electronic spectra remain elusive. Even for\nmetal-free porphyrins, no consensus exists on the origin of the splitting of\ntheir $Q$-bands, an energetic region critical in photosynthesis. We leverage\nour recent statistical treatment of molecular motions in the condensed phase to\npredict their linear absorption spectra. By bridging exact quantum-dynamical\nexpressions with atomistic simulations, our theory is the first to capture the\nspectra of representative porphyrins in solution: porphine,\ntetraphenylporphyrin, and tetraphenylporpholactone. Our work reveals that\n$Q$-band splitting arises from extreme timescale separation of nuclear motions\nthat turn symmetry-forbidden transitions bright.
