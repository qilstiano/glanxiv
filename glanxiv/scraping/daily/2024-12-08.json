    "abstract": "Ice sheet simulations suffer from vast parametric uncertainties, such as the\nbasal sliding boundary condition or geothermal heat flux. Quantifying the\nresulting uncertainties in predictions is of utmost importance to support\njudicious decision-making, but high-fidelity simulations are too expensive to\nembed within uncertainty quantification (UQ) computations. UQ methods typically\nemploy Monte Carlo simulation to estimate statistics of interest, which\nrequires hundreds (or more) of ice sheet simulations. Cheaper low-fidelity\nmodels are readily available (e.g., approximated physics, coarser meshes), but\nreplacing the high-fidelity model with a lower fidelity surrogate introduces\nbias, which means that UQ results generated with a low-fidelity model cannot be\nrigorously trusted. Multifidelity UQ retains the high-fidelity model but\nexpands the estimator to shift computations to low-fidelity models, while still\nguaranteeing an unbiased estimate. Through this exploitation of multiple\nmodels, multifidelity estimators guarantee a target accuracy at reduced\ncomputational cost. This paper presents a comprehensive multifidelity UQ\nframework for ice sheet simulations. We present three multifidelity UQ\napproaches -- Multifidelity Monte Carlo, Multilevel Monte Carlo, and the Best\nLinear Unbiased Estimator -- that enable tractable UQ for continental-scale ice\nsheet simulations. We demonstrate the techniques on a model of the Greenland\nice sheet to estimate the 2015-2050 ice mass loss, verify their estimates\nthrough comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, and give a comparative\nperformance analysis. For a target accuracy equivalent to 1 mm sea level rise\ncontribution at 95% confidence, the multifidelity estimators achieve\ncomputational speedups of two orders of magnitude.",

The analysis is performed by computing the transmission\ncoefficient of an electromagnetic monochromatic wave obliquely incident on the\noptical system and linearly polarized with the transverse-electric\npolarization. The optical system is supposed to be surrounded by a vacuum. Two\ndifferent optical systems are studied. First, the system under consideration is\nassumed to be composed of the junction of a single dispersive layer with a\nlinear electromagnetic response and a single nonlinear layer exhibiting Kerr\nnonlinearity. The obtained results suggest the excitation of stationary\nsolitons in the nonlinear layer induced by the occurrence of the Brewster\nphenomenon in the linear medium. The second system is considered as a single\nKerr nonlinear layer. The Brewster effect is observed for both self-focusing\nand self-defocusing nonlinearities, which leads to the excitation of soliton\nstates within the nonlinear layer. The Brewster-angle dependence of the\nintensity of the incident electromagnetic wave is also shown. Finally, the\nexcitation of omnidirectional solitons in the case of single nonlinear layers\nis discussed. It is shown that matching the magnetic permeability of the\nsurrounding medium and the nonlinear layer leads to maximum transmission\nstates, independent of the incidence angle, for the input-intensity value that\ncauses the homogenization of the electric permittivity.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the Natural Language\nProcessing field and is the backbone of Large Language Models (LLMs). The\nTransformer uses the attention mechanism that computes the pair-wise similarity\nbetween its input tokens to produce latent vectors that are able to understand\nthe semantic meaning of the input text. One of the challenges in the\nTransformer architecture is the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism\nthat prohibits the efficient processing of long sequence lengths. While many\nrecent research works have attempted to provide a reduction from $O(n^2)$ time\ncomplexity of attention to semi-linear complexity, it remains an unsolved\nproblem in the sense of maintaining a high performance when such complexity is\nreduced. One of the important works in this respect is the Perceiver class of\narchitectures that have demonstrated excellent performance while reducing the\ncomputation complexity. In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR that was proposed\nfor Auto-Regressive modeling as a baseline, and provide three different\narchitectural enhancements to it with varying computation overhead tradeoffs.\nInspired by the recently proposed efficient attention computation approach of\nLong-LoRA, we then present an equally efficient Perceiver-based architecture\n(termed as Long LoRA Pereceiver - LLP) that can be used as the base\narchitecture in LLMs instead of just a fine-tuning add-on.

We find that the stellar bar\nin CEERS-30155 is not visible in the F115W image, which traces rest-frame\nultraviolet (UV) light at $z\\sim$2, a rest-frame wavelength highly obscured by\ndust. The stellar bar is visible in the F200W image, but is most prominent in\nthe F444W image, likely due to the F444W image tracing rest-frame near-infrared\n(NIR) light at $z\\sim$2. Rest-frame NIR light is not obscured by dust and\ntraces low-mass, long-lived stars that dominate the stellar mass in galaxies.\nHowever, ellipse fits of the F444W image only robustly detect stellar bars\nwhose semimajor axis are at least one PSF ($\\sim$ 0.16\" or $\\sim$ 1.4 kpc at\n$z\\sim$2).

    "abstract": "The use of external data in clinical trials offers numerous advantages, such\nas reducing the number of patients, increasing study power, and shortening\ntrial durations. In Bayesian inference, information in external data can be\ntransferred into an informative prior for future borrowing (i.e., prior\nsynthesis). However, multisource external data often exhibits heterogeneity,\nwhich can lead to information distortion during the prior synthesis. Clustering\nhelps identifying the heterogeneity, enhancing the congruence between\nsynthesized prior and external data, thereby preventing information distortion.\nObtaining optimal clustering is challenging due to the trade-off between\ncongruence with external data and robustness to future data. We introduce two\noverlapping indices: the overlapping clustering index (OCI) and the overlapping\nevidence index (OEI). Using these indices alongside a K-Means algorithm, the\noptimal clustering of external data can be identified by balancing the\ntrade-off. Based on the clustering result, we propose a prior synthesis\nframework to effectively borrow information from multisource external data. By\nincorporating the (robust) meta-analytic predictive prior into this framework,\nwe develop (robust) Bayesian clustering MAP priors. Simulation studies and\nreal-data analysis demonstrate their superiority over commonly used priors in\nthe presence of heterogeneity. Since the Bayesian clustering priors are\nconstructed without needing data from the prospective study to be conducted,\nthey can be applied to both study design and data analysis in clinical trials\nor experiments.",

    ],
    "abstract": "In many fields, such as language acquisition, neuropsychology of language,\nthe study of aging, and historical linguistics, corpora are used for estimating\nthe diversity of grammatical structures that are produced during a period by an\nindividual, community, or type of speakers. In these cases, treebanks are taken\nas representative samples of the syntactic structures that might be\nencountered. Generalizing the potential syntactic diversity from the structures\ndocumented in a small corpus requires careful extrapolation whose accuracy is\nconstrained by the limited size of representative sub-corpora. In this article,\nI demonstrate -- theoretically, and empirically -- that a grammar's\nderivational entropy and the mean length of the utterances (MLU) it generates\nare fundamentally linked, giving rise to a new measure, the derivational\nentropy rate. The mean length of utterances becomes the most practical index of\nsyntactic complexity; I demonstrate that MLU is not a mere proxy, but a\nfundamental measure of syntactic diversity. In combination with the new\nderivational entropy rate measure, it provides a theory-free assessment of\ngrammatical complexity. The derivational entropy rate indexes the rate at which\ndifferent grammatical annotation frameworks determine the grammatical\ncomplexity of treebanks. I introduce the Smoothed Induced Treebank Entropy\n(SITE) as a tool for estimating these measures accurately, even from very small\ntreebanks. I conclude by discussing important implications of these results for\nboth NLP and human language processing.",

    "abstract": "A giant impact has been proposed as a possible formation mechanism for\nJupiter's dilute core -- the planet's inferred internal structure in which the\ntransition between its core of heavy elements and its predominantly\nhydrogen-helium envelope is gradual rather than a discrete interface. A past\nsimulation suggested that a head-on impact of a $10~M_\\oplus$ planet into an\nalmost fully formed, differentiated Jupiter could lead to a post-impact planet\nwith a smooth compositional gradient and a central heavy-element fraction as\nlow as $Z\\approx0.5$. Here, we present simulations of giant impacts on to\nJupiter using improved numerical methods to reassess the feasibility of this\nscenario. We use the REMIX smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation,\nwhich has been newly developed to improve the treatment of mixing in SPH\nsimulations. We note that, as in previous works, chemical mixing is not\nincluded in these models and that incorporating such processes at sub-particle\nscales could improve numerical convergence. We perform giant impact simulations\nwith varying speeds, angles, pre-impact planet structures, and equations of\nstate. In all of our simulations, heavy elements re-settle over short\ntime-scales to form a differentiated core, even in cases where the core is\ninitially disrupted into a transiently mixed state. A dilute core is not\nproduced in any of our simulations. These results, combined with recent\nobservations that indicate Saturn also has a dilute core, suggest that such\nstructures are produced as part of the extended formation and evolution of\ngiant planets, rather than through extreme, low-likelihood giant impacts.",

The conventional\nseparation processes are inefficient in removing empty and partially filled\ncapsids, have low yield, scale poorly, time consuming and need additional\npurification steps. This article demonstrates one step separation of full\ncapsids from a mixture of full, partially filled, and empty capsids, and other\nprotein impurities using selective crystallization, a purification process,\nwhich is first time in protein purification and is performed without physically\nor chemically modifying the target component for the first time in the history\nof selective crystallization, and is highly-efficient, highly-scalable, and\neconomical.

Given such complex instructions, SOTA models often make mistakes in\nfaithfully modeling object attributes, and relationships among them. In this\nwork, we present an alternate paradigm for T2I synthesis, decomposing the task\nof complex multi-step generation into three steps, (a) Generate: we first\ngenerate an image using existing diffusion models (b) Plan: we make use of\nMulti-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) to identify the mistakes in the generated image\nexpressed in terms of individual objects and their properties, and produce a\nsequence of corrective steps required in the form of an edit-plan. (c) Edit: we\nmake use of an existing text-guided image editing models to sequentially\nexecute our edit-plan over the generated image to get the desired image which\nis faithful to the original instruction. Our approach derives its strength from\nthe fact that it is modular in nature, is training free, and can be applied\nover any combination of image generation and editing models. As an added\ncontribution, we also develop a model capable of compositional editing, which\nfurther helps improve the overall accuracy of our proposed approach. Our method\nflexibly trades inference time compute with performance on compositional text\nprompts. We perform extensive experimental evaluation across 3 benchmarks and\n10 T2I models including DALLE-3 and the latest -- SD-3.5-Large.

    "abstract": "Generalizing metric monocular depth estimation presents a significant\nchallenge due to its ill-posed nature, while the entanglement between camera\nparameters and depth amplifies issues further, hindering multi-dataset training\nand zero-shot accuracy. This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous\nvehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups,\nlimiting the geometric diversity. Yet, this context also presents an\nopportunity: the fixed relationship between the camera and the ground plane\nimposes additional perspective geometry constraints, enabling depth regression\nvia vertical image positions of objects. However, this cue is highly\nsusceptible to overfitting, thus we propose a novel canonical representation\nthat maintains consistency across varied camera setups, effectively\ndisentangling depth from specific parameters and enhancing generalization\nacross datasets. We also propose a novel architecture that adaptively and\nprobabilistically fuses depths estimated via object size and vertical image\nposition cues. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach on five autonomous driving datasets, achieving accurate\nmetric depth estimation for varying resolutions, aspect ratios and camera\nsetups. Notably, we achieve comparable accuracy to existing zero-shot methods,\ndespite training on a single dataset with a single-camera setup.",

    "abstract": "Imagine a smart camera trap selectively clicking pictures to understand\nanimal movement patterns within a particular habitat. These \"snapshots\", or\npieces of data captured from a data stream at adaptively chosen times, provide\na glimpse of different animal movements unfolding through time. Learning a\ncontinuous-time process through snapshots, such as smart camera traps, is a\ncentral theme governing a wide array of online learning situations. In this\npaper, we adopt a learning-theoretic perspective in understanding the\nfundamental nature of learning different classes of functions from both\ndiscrete data streams and continuous data streams. In our first framework, the\n\\textit{update-and-deploy} setting, a learning algorithm discretely queries\nfrom a process to update a predictor designed to make predictions given as\ninput the data stream. We construct a uniform sampling algorithm that can learn\nwith bounded error any concept class with finite Littlestone dimension. Our\nsecond framework, known as the \\emph{blind-prediction} setting, consists of a\nlearning algorithm generating predictions independently of observing the\nprocess, only engaging with the process when it chooses to make queries.\nInterestingly, we show a stark contrast in learnability where non-trivial\nconcept classes are unlearnable. However, we show that adaptive learning\nalgorithms are necessary to learn sets of time-dependent and data-dependent\nfunctions, called pattern classes, in either framework. Finally, we develop a\ntheory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction\nsetting.",

Although promising, recent\nwork applying RAG to long-context tasks has two core limitations: 1) there has\nbeen little focus on making the RAG pipeline compute efficient, and 2) such\nworks only test on simple QA tasks, and their performance on more challenging\ntasks is unclear. To address this, we develop an algorithm based on PageRank, a\ngraph-based retrieval algorithm, which we call mixture-of-PageRanks (MixPR).\nMixPR uses a mixture of PageRank-based graph-retrieval algorithms implemented\nusing sparse matrices for efficent, cheap retrieval that can deal with a\nvariety of complex tasks. Our MixPR retriever achieves state-of-the-art results\nacross a wide range of long-context benchmark tasks, outperforming both\nexisting RAG methods, specialized retrieval architectures, and long-context\nLLMs despite being far more compute efficient.

Matched Source Waveform\nInversion (MSWI) extends the wave propagation model by a filter that shifts\npredicted waves to fit observed data. The MSWI objective adds a penalty for\ndeviation of this filter from the identity to the mean-square data misfit . The\nextension allows the inversion to make large model adjustments while\nmaintaining data fit and so reduces the chances of local optimization iterates\nstagnating at non-informative model estimates. Theory suggests that MSWI\napplied to acoustic transmission data with single-arrival wavefronts may\nproduce an estimate of refractive index similar to the result of travel time\ninversion, but without requiring explicit identification of travel times.\nNumerical experiments conform to this expectation, in that MSWI applied to\nsingle arrival transmission data gives reasonable model estimates in cases\nwhere FWI fails. This MSWI model can then be used to jumpstart FWI for further\nrefinement of the model. The addition of moderate amounts of noise (30\\%) does\nnot negatively impact MSWI's ability to converge.

In particular, given two\ntangles, $T$ and $S$, Conway defines the tangle sum $T+S$. Given the character\nvarieties of $T$ and $S$, we show how to construct the perturbed character\nvariety of $T+S$. This is done by first studying the perturbed character\nvariety of a certain tangle $C_3$ properly embedded in $S^3$ with 3 balls\nremoved. Using these results, we prove a nontriviality result for the bounding\ncochains in the conjecture of Cazassus, Herald, Kirk, and Kotelskiy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Language Model as Visual Explainer LVX, a\nsystematic approach for interpreting the internal workings of vision models\nusing a tree-structured linguistic explanation, without the need for model\ntraining. Central to our strategy is the collaboration between vision models\nand LLM to craft explanations. On one hand, the LLM is harnessed to delineate\nhierarchical visual attributes, while concurrently, a text-to-image API\nretrieves images that are most aligned with these textual concepts. By mapping\nthe collected texts and images to the vision model's embedding space, we\nconstruct a hierarchy-structured visual embedding tree. This tree is\ndynamically pruned and grown by querying the LLM using language templates,\ntailoring the explanation to the model. Such a scheme allows us to seamlessly\nincorporate new attributes while eliminating undesired concepts based on the\nmodel's representations. When applied to testing samples, our method provides\nhuman-understandable explanations in the form of attribute-laden trees. Beyond\nexplanation, we retrained the vision model by calibrating it on the generated\nconcept hierarchy, allowing the model to incorporate the refined knowledge of\nvisual attributes. To access the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce\nnew benchmarks and conduct rigorous evaluations, demonstrating its\nplausibility, faithfulness, and stability.",

This study\nconsiders the lifetime risk of dying from lung cancer related to occupational\nradon exposure, focusing on lifetime excess absolute risk (LEAR), in addition\nto other lifetime risk measures. This article derives and discusses uncertainty\nintervals for these estimates.\n  Methods\n  Uncertainties in two components of lifetime risk calculations are modeled:\nrisk model parameter estimates for excess relative risk of lung cancer and\nbaseline mortality rates. Approximate normality assumption (ANA) methods and\nBayesian techniques quantify risk model parameter uncertainty. The methods are\napplied to risk models from the German \"Wismut\" uranium miners cohort study\n(full cohort with follow-up 2018 and the 1960+ sub-cohort of miners hired in\n1960 or later). Mortality rate uncertainty is assessed based on WHO data. Monte\nCarlo simulations yield uncertainty intervals, which are compared across\ndifferent lifetime risk measures.\n  Results\n  Risk model parameter uncertainty is the largest contributor to lifetime risk\nuncertainty, with baseline mortality rate uncertainty also significant. For the\n1960+ sub-cohort risk model, LEAR was 6.70% (95% uncertainty interval: [3.26,\n12.28]) for an exposure of 2 Working Level Months from age 18-64, compared to\n3.43% ([2.06, 4.84]) for the full cohort. Differences across lifetime risk\nmeasures are minor.\n  Conclusion\n  Here, risk model parameter uncertainty substantially drives lifetime risk\nuncertainty, supporting the use of ANA methods for practicality. Choice of\nlifetime risk measures has negligible impact. Derived uncertainty intervals\nalign with the range of lifetime risk estimates from uranium miners studies in\nthe literature and should inform radiation protection policies based on\nlifetime risks.",

The\nlateral thermal conductivity of 1-3L of Fe:MoS2 and the interfacial thermal\nconductance between Fe:MoS2 and the substrate were obtained by analyzing the\ntemperature-dependent and power-dependent Raman measurement, laser power\nabsorption coefficient, and laser spot sizes.

To\nfacilitate maximum likelihood (ML) data detection without knowledge of\nnonlinear and unknown hardware impairments, we develop novel likelihood\nfunction (LF) estimation methods based on data augmentation and boosting. The\ncore idea of our methods is to generate multiple augmented datasets by\ninjecting noise with various distributions into seed data consisting of online\nreceived signals. We then estimate the LF using each augmented dataset based on\neither the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm or the kernel density\nestimation (KDE) method. Inspired by boosting, we further refine the estimated\nLF by linearly combining the multiple LF estimates obtained from the augmented\ndatasets. To determine the weights for this linear combination, we develop\nthree methods that take different approaches to measure the reliability of the\nestimated LFs. Simulation results demonstrate that both the EM- and KDE-based\nLF estimation methods offer significant performance gains over existing LF\nestimation methods. Our results also show that the effectiveness of the\nproposed methods improves as the size of the augmented data increases.",

We\ninvestigate the complexity of this problem depending on how termination of $R$\ncan be established. We show that the problem is in general NP-complete for\nlength-reducing term rewriting systems. Its complexity increases to\nN2ExpTime-complete (NExpTime-complete) if termination is proved using a\n(linear) polynomial order and to PSpace-complete for systems whose termination\ncan be shown using a restricted class of Knuth-Bendix orders. Confluence\nreduces the complexity to P for the length-reducing case, but has no effect on\nthe worst-case complexity in the other two cases. Finally, we consider the\nlarge term reachability problem, a variant of the problem where we are\ninterested in reachability of a term of size $\\geq n$. It turns out that this\nseemingly innocuous modification in some cases changes the complexity of the\nproblem, which may also become dependent on whether the number $n$ is is\nrepresented in unary or binary encoding, whereas this makes no difference for\nthe complexity of the small term reachability problem.",

    "abstract": "A novel method for tackling the problem of imbalanced data in medical image\nsegmentation is proposed in this work. In balanced cross entropy (CE) loss,\nwhich is a type of weighted CE loss, the weight assigned to each class is the\nin-verse of the class frequency. These balancing weights are expected to\nequalize the effect of each class on the overall loss and prevent the model\nfrom being biased towards the majority class. But, as it has been shown in\nprevious studies, this method degrades the performance by a large margin.\nTherefore, balanced CE is not a popular loss in medical segmentation tasks, and\nusually a region-based loss, like the Dice loss, is used to address the class\nimbalance problem. In the pro-posed method, the weighting of cross entropy loss\nfor each class is based on a dilated area of each class mask, and balancing\nweights are assigned to each class together with its surrounding pixels. The\ngoal of this study is to show that the performance of balanced CE loss can be\ngreatly improved my modifying its weighting strategy. Experiments on different\ndatasets show that the proposed dilated balanced CE (DBCE) loss outperforms the\nbalanced CE loss by a large margin and produces superior results compared to CE\nloss, and its performance is similar to the performance of the combination of\nDice and CE loss. This means that a weighted cross entropy loss with the right\nweighing strategy can be as effective as a region-based loss in handling the\nproblem of class imbalance in medical segmentation tasks.",

The resulting space of metric theories of gravity may\naddress open conceptual and observational puzzles through a wealth of effects\nbeyond general relativity, whose traces can be searched for within today's and\ntomorrow's gravitational testing grounds. Above all, we offer a generic metric\ntheory generalization of Isaacson's approach to the leading-order field\nequations of physical perturbations with a well-defined notion of\nenergy-momentum carried by the gravitational waves. Within this framework, we\nidentify the backreaction of the Isaacson energy-momentum flux onto the\nbackground spacetime with the displacement memory effect that induces a\npermanent distortion of space after the passage of a gravitational wave. This\neffect is a well-known prediction of GR whose dominant contribution captures\nits inherent non-linear nature, manifest in the ability of gravity to\ngravitate. However, the novel interpretation of memory as naturally arising\nwithin the Isaacson approach to gravitational waves comes with two main\nadvantages. Firstly, it allows for a unified understanding of both the null and\nthe ordinary memory effect, which are respectively sourced by unbound energy\nfluxes that do and do not reach asymptotic null infinity.

    "abstract": "Semantic communications provide significant performance gains over\ntraditional communications by transmitting task-relevant semantic features\nthrough wireless channels. However, most existing studies rely on end-to-end\n(E2E) training of neural-type encoders and decoders to ensure effective\ntransmission of these semantic features. To enable semantic communications\nwithout relying on E2E training, this paper presents a vision transformer\n(ViT)-based semantic communication system with importance-aware quantization\n(IAQ) for wireless image transmission. The core idea of the presented system is\nto leverage the attention scores of a pretrained ViT model to quantify the\nimportance levels of image patches. Based on this idea, our IAQ framework\nassigns different quantization bits to image patches based on their importance\nlevels. This is achieved by formulating a weighted quantization error\nminimization problem, where the weight is set to be an increasing function of\nthe attention score. Then, an optimal incremental allocation method and a\nlow-complexity water-filling method are devised to solve the formulated\nproblem. Our framework is further extended for realistic digital communication\nsystems by modifying the bit allocation problem and the corresponding\nallocation methods based on an equivalent binary symmetric channel (BSC) model.\nSimulations on single-view and multi-view image classification tasks show that\nour IAQ framework outperforms conventional image compression methods in both\nerror-free and realistic communication scenarios.",

An in-context learning (ICL)\nproblem comprises a CGM, a dataset, and a prediction task. The CGM could be a\nmulti-modal foundation model; the dataset, a collection of patient histories,\ntest results, and recorded diagnoses; and the prediction task to communicate a\ndiagnosis to a new patient. A Bayesian interpretation of ICL assumes that the\nCGM computes a posterior predictive distribution over an unknown Bayesian model\ndefining a joint distribution over latent explanations and observable data.\nFrom this perspective, Bayesian model criticism is a reasonable approach to\nassess the suitability of a given CGM for an ICL problem. However, such\napproaches -- like posterior predictive checks (PPCs) -- often assume that we\ncan sample from the likelihood and posterior defined by the Bayesian model,\nwhich are not explicitly given for contemporary CGMs. To address this, we show\nwhen ancestral sampling from the predictive distribution of a CGM is equivalent\nto sampling datasets from the posterior predictive of the assumed Bayesian\nmodel. Then we develop the generative predictive $p$-value, which enables PPCs\nand their cousins for contemporary CGMs. The generative predictive $p$-value\ncan then be used in a statistical decision procedure to determine when the\nmodel is appropriate for an ICL problem. Our method only requires generating\nqueries and responses from a CGM and evaluating its response log probability.\nWe empirically evaluate our method on synthetic tabular, imaging, and natural\nlanguage ICL tasks using large language models.",

We propose FlexDiT, a framework\nthat dynamically adapts token density across both spatial and temporal\ndimensions to achieve computational efficiency without compromising generation\nquality. Spatially, FlexDiT employs a three-segment architecture that allocates\ntoken density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the\nbottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token\nModules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local\ndetail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details.\nTemporally, FlexDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising\nstages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later\ntimesteps. This synergy between FlexDiT's spatially adaptive architecture and\nits temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances\nefficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process.

In literature, those\nmodels usually assume that the latter are unobservable. However, there are\ncases in which a cured individual may be identified. For example, when studying\nthe distant metastasis during the lifetime or the miscarriage during pregnancy,\nindividuals that have died without a metastasis or have given birth are\ncertainly non-susceptible. The same also holds when studying the x-year overall\nsurvival or the death during hospital stay. Common MC models ignore this\ninformation and consider them all censored, thus yielding in risk of assigning\nlow immune probabilities to cured individuals. In this study, we consider a MC\nmodel that incorporates known information on cured individuals, with the time\nto cure identification being either deterministic or stochastic. We use the\nexpectation-maximization algorithm to derive the maximum likelihood estimators.\nFurthermore, we compare different strategies that account for cure information\nsuch as (1) assigning infinite times to event for known cured cases and\nadjusting the traditional model and (2) considering only the probability of\ncure identification but ignoring the time until that happens. Theoretical\nresults and simulations demonstrate the value of the proposed model especially\nwhen the time to cure identification is stochastic, increasing precision and\ndecreasing the mean squared error. On the other hand, the traditional models\nthat ignore the known cured information perform well when the curation is\nachieved after a known cutoff point. Moreover, through simulations the\ncomparisons of the different strategies are examined, as possible alternatives\nto the complete-information model.",

In this paper, we aim at\ndeveloping new fixed-budget robust R&S procedures to minimize the probability\nof incorrect selection (PICS) under a limited sampling budget. Inspired by an\nadditive upper bound of the PICS, we derive a new asymptotically optimal\nsolution to the budget allocation problem.

Consequently, these interactions can only attain an observable\nlevel through the influence of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics effects.\nIt is therefore of great importance to investigate these rare interactions,\nboth to test the limits of the Standard Model and to reveal new physical\nsignatures.In this context, the present study analyses the signal of the\nprocess $\\mu^+\\mu^- \\to t\\bar{q}h$ and the background processes $t\\bar{t}$,\n$tW\\bar{b}$, $WWh$ and $WW$ at both in $\\sqrt{s} = 1$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s} = 3$\nTeV energy levels.

This result corresponds\nto an improvement of approximately 1.5 times compared to the current limits of\nthe ATLAS experiment, which are $3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.

Consequently, the results are\nexpected to provide a crucial foundation for both experimental and theoretical\nstudies and to make a significant contribution to the search for BSM physics.",

The Uranus Orbiter and Probe\n(UOP), the next NASA Flagship mission prioritized by the Planetary Science and\nAstrobiology Survey 2023-2032, will constrain the planet's interior by\nmeasuring its gravity and magnetic fields. To characterize the Uranian\ninterior, here we present CORGI, a newly developed planetary interior and\ngravity model. We confirm that high degrees of mixing are required for Uranus\ninterior models to be consistent with the $J_2$ and $J_4$ gravity harmonics\nmeasured by Voyager 2. Empirical models, which have smooth density profiles\nthat require extensive mixing, can reproduce the Voyager 2 measurements.\nDistinct-layer models with mantles composed of H$_2$O-H/He or\nH$_2$O-CH$_4$-NH$_3$ mixtures are consistent with the Voyager 2 measurements if\nthe heavy element mass fraction, $Z$, in the mantle $\\lesssim85\\%$, or if\natmospheric $Z$ $\\gtrsim25\\%$.

The UOP can robustly constrain\n$J_6$ and potentially $J_8$ given polar orbits within rings. An ice-rich\ncomposition can naturally explain the source of Uranus' magnetic field.\nHowever, because the physical properties of rock-ice mixtures are poorly known,\nmagnetic field generation by a rock-rich composition cannot be ruled out.\nFuture experiments and simulations on realistic planetary building materials\nwill be essential for refining Uranus interior models.",

This problem critically undermines the\napplicability of LLMs in communication systems yet has not been systematically\nexplored. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review of LLM applications\nin communications, with a particular emphasis on hallucination mitigation.\nSpecifically, we analyze hallucination causes and summarize hallucination\nmitigation strategies from both model- and system-based perspectives.\nAfterward, we review representative LLM-empowered communication schemes,\ndetailing potential hallucination scenarios and comparing the mitigation\nstrategies they adopted. Finally, we present a case study of a Telecom-oriented\nLLM that utilizes a novel hybrid approach to enhance the hallucination-aware\nservice experience. On the model side, we publish a Telecom hallucination\ndataset and apply direct preference optimization to fine-tune LLMs, resulting\nin a 20.6\\% correct rate improvement. Moreover, we construct a mobile-edge\nmixture-of-experts architecture for optimal LLM expert activation.

QMC is among the most\naccurate and powerful approaches to the study of electronic structure, but its\napplication is often hindered by a steep learning curve, hence it is rarely\naddressed in undergraduate and postgraduate classes. This tutorial is a step\ntowards filling this gap. We offer an introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo\n(DMC) method, which aims to solve the imaginary time Schr\\\"odinger equation\nthrough stochastic sampling of the configuration space. Starting from the\ntheoretical foundations, the discussion leads naturally to the formulation of a\nstep-by-step algorithm. To illustrate how the method works in simplified\nscenarios, examples such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are\nprovided. The discussion extends to the fixed-node approximation, a crucial\napproach for addressing the fermionic sign problem in multi-electron systems.\nIn particular, we examine the influence of trial wavefunction nodal surfaces on\nthe accuracy of DMC energy by evaluating results from a non-interacting\ntwo-fermion system. Extending the method to excited states is feasible in\nprinciple, but some additional considerations are needed, supported by\npractical insights.

    "abstract": "Context. Observations of slow magnetoacoustic waves in solar coronal loops\nsuggest that, in hot coronal plasma, heat conduction may be suppressed in\ncomparison with the classical thermal transport model. Aims. We link this\nsuppression with the effect of the non-local thermal transport that appears\nwhen the plasma temperature perturbation gradient becomes comparable to the\nelectron mean free path. Moreover, we consider a finite time of thermalisation\nbetween electrons and ions, so that separate electron and ion temperatures can\noccur in the loop. Methods. We numerically compare the influence of the local\nand non-local thermal transport models on standing slow waves in one- and\ntwo-temperature coronal loops. To quantify our comparison, we use the period\nand damping time of the waves as commonly observed parameters. Results. Our\nstudy reveals that non-local thermal transport can result in either shorter or\nlonger slow-wave damping times in comparison with the local conduction model\ndue to the suppression of the isothermal regime. The difference in damping\ntimes can reach 80%. For hot coronal loops, we found that the finite\nequilibration between electron and ion temperatures results in up to 50% longer\ndamping time compared to the one-temperature case. These results indicate that\nnon-local transport will influence the dynamics of compressive waves across a\nbroad range of coronal plasma parameters with Knudsen numbers (the ratio of\nmean-free-path to temperature scale length) larger than 1%. Conclusions. In the\nsolar corona, the non-local thermal transport shows a significant influence on\nthe dynamics of standing slow waves in a broad range of plasma parameters,\nwhile two-temperature effects come into play for hot and less dense loops.",

    "abstract": "In the early Universe, neutrinos decouple quickly from the primordial plasma\nand propagate without further interactions. The impact of free-streaming\nneutrinos is to create a temporal shift in the gravitational potential that\nimpacts the acoustic waves known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs),\nresulting in a non-linear spatial shift in the Fourier-space BAO signal. In\nthis work, we make use of and extend upon an existing methodology to measure\nthe phase shift amplitude $\\beta_{\\phi}$ and apply it to the DESI Data Release\n1 (DR1) BAOs with an anisotropic BAO fitting pipeline. We validate the fitting\nmethodology by testing the pipeline with two publicly available fitting codes\napplied to highly precise cubic box simulations and realistic simulations\nrepresentative of the DESI DR1 data. We find further study towards the methods\nused in fitting the BAO signal will be necessary to ensure accurate constraints\non $\\beta_{\\phi}$ in future DESI data releases. Using DESI DR1, we present\nindividual measurements of the anisotropic BAO distortion parameters and the\n$\\beta_{\\phi}$ for the different tracers, and additionally a combined fit to\n$\\beta_{\\phi}$ resulting in $\\beta_{\\phi} = 2.7 \\pm 1.7$. After including a\nprior on the distortion parameters from constraints using \\textit{Planck} we\nfind $\\beta_{\\phi} = 2.7^{+0.60}_{-0.67} $ suggesting $\\beta_{\\phi} > 0$ at\n4.3$\\sigma$ significance. This result may hint at a phase shift that is not\npurely sourced from the standard model expectation for $N_{\\rm{eff}}$ or could\nbe a upwards statistical fluctuation in the measured $\\beta_{\\phi}$; this\nresult relaxes in models with additional freedom beyond $\\Lambda$CDM.",

    "abstract": "Quantum mechanics has transformed our understanding of reality, yet deep\nphilosophical puzzles remain unresolved. Is there a consistent way to describe\nquantum measurement, the emergence of space and time, and the role of observers\nwithin one coherent ontology? This paper introduces Relational Quantum Dynamics\n(RQD), an interpretation that places relationships and information, not\nisolated objects, at the foundation of physics. Unlike traditional views, such\nas the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or\nhidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality,\ninstead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational\ncontexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's\ntheorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by\nreplacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests\non five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and\nobserver-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than\nexisting as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of\nquantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated\ninformation, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence\nwithout special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic\nstructural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe\nconsists entirely of informational relations. It avoids collapsing into\nrelativism or solipsism by ensuring intersubjective agreement through physical\ninteractions. Ultimately, RQD may offer a unified picture in which quantum\nmechanics, spacetime, and observers are no longer separate domains but aspects\nof one interconnected informational web.",

    "abstract": "We will study some important properties of Boolean functions based on newly\nintroduced concepts called Special Decomposition of a Set and Special Covering\nof a Set. These concepts enable us to study important problems concerning\nBoolean functions represented in conjunctive normal form including the\nsatisfiability problem. Studying the relationship between the Boolean\nsatisfiability problem and the problem of existence of a special covering for\nset we show that these problems are polynomially equivalent. This means that\nthe problem of existence of a special covering for a set is an NP complete\nproblem. We prove an important theorem regarding the relationship between these\nproblems. The Boolean function in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable if and\nonly if there is a special covering for the set of clauses of this function.\nThe purpose of the article is also to study some important properties of\nsatisfiable Boolean functions using the concepts of special decomposition and\nspecial covering of a set. We introduce the concept of generation of\nsatisfiable function by another satisfiable function by means of admissible\nchanges in the clauses of the function. We will prove that if the generation of\na function by another function is defined as a binary relation then the set of\nsatisfiable functions of n variables represented in conjunctive normal form\nwith m clauses is partitioned to equivalence classes In addition, extending the\nrules of admissible changes we prove that arbitrary two satisfiable Boolean\nfunctions of n variables represented in conjunctive normal form with m clauses\ncan be generated from each other.",

However, current mid-IR photodetector technologies\nare limited by their cost and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate a new\ntype of photodetector based on a tunnel structure made of two-dimensional\nmaterials. The effect manifests when the upper and lower layers of the tunnel\nstructure are heated differently. The photoswitching is threshold-based and\nrepresents a ``jump'' in voltage to another branch of the current-voltage\ncharacteristic when illuminated at a given current. This mechanism provides\nenormous photovoltage (0.05$-$1~V) even under weak illumination. Our\nphotodetector has built-in nonlinearity and is therefore an ideal candidate for\nuse in infrared vision neurons. Additionally, using this structure, we\ndemonstrated the possibility of selective heating of layers in a van der Waals\nstack using mid-IR illumination. This method will allow the study of heat\ntransfer processes between layers of van der Waals structures, opening new\navenues in the physics of phonon interactions.",

    "abstract": "Occupancy prediction has garnered increasing attention in recent years for\nits comprehensive fine-grained environmental representation and strong\ngeneralization to open-set objects. However, cumbersome voxel features and 3D\nconvolution operations inevitably introduce large overheads in both memory and\ncomputation, obstructing the deployment of occupancy prediction approaches in\nreal-time autonomous driving systems. Although some methods attempt to\nefficiently predict 3D occupancy from 2D Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features through\nthe Channel-to-Height mechanism, BEV features are insufficient to store all the\nheight information of the scene, which limits performance. This paper proposes\nLightOcc, an innovative 3D occupancy prediction framework that leverages\nLightweight Spatial Embedding to effectively supplement the height clues for\nthe BEV-based representation while maintaining its deployability. Firstly,\nGlobal Spatial Sampling is used to obtain the Single-Channel Occupancy from\nmulti-view depth distribution. Spatial-to-Channel mechanism then takes the\narbitrary spatial dimension of Single-Channel Occupancy as the feature\ndimension and extracts Tri-Perspective Views (TPV) Embeddings by 2D\nconvolution. Finally, TPV Embeddings will interact with each other by\nLightweight TPV Interaction module to obtain the Spatial Embedding that is\noptimal supplementary to BEV features. Sufficient experimental results show\nthat LightOcc significantly increases the prediction accuracy of the baseline\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark.",

Our results are primarily based\non a Jastrow-Slater wave function and variational Monte Carlo methods, but also\ncorroborated by density-matrix renormalization group calculations. In the\nnon-interacting limit, when varying $M>0$, a gapless point separates a trivial\nphase from a topological one.

Most importantly, at finite values of $U$,\nthe transition between the trivial and topological states is not direct, since\nan emergent insulator, which shows evidence of sustaining gapless spin\nexcitations, intrudes between them. A small $V$ interaction further stabilizes\nthe intermediate insulator, while a sufficiently large value of this\nnearest-neighbor repulsion gives rise to two different charge-density wave\ninsulators, one fully gapped and another still supporting gapless spin\nexcitations.

However, the\nproperties and acceleration mechanisms of relativistic electrons directly\nassociated with reconnection X-line are not well understood. This study\nutilizes Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) measurements to analyze the flux and\nspectral features of sub-relativistic to relativistic (~ 80 to 560 keV)\nelectrons during a magnetic reconnection event in Earth's magnetotail. This\nevent provided a unique opportunity to measure the electrons directly energized\nby X-line as MMS stayed in the separatrix layer, where the magnetic field\ndirectly connects to the X-line, for approximately half of the observation\nperiod. Our analysis revealed that the fluxes of relativistic electrons were\nclearly enhanced within the separatrix layer, and the highest flux was directed\naway from the X-line, which suggested that these electrons originated directly\nfrom the X-line. Spectral analysis showed that these relativistic electrons\ndeviated from the main plasma sheet population and exhibited an \"ankle\" feature\nsimilar to that observed in galactic cosmic rays. The contribution of \"ankle\"\nelectrons to the total electron energy density increased from 0.1% to 1% in the\nseparatrix layer, though the spectral slopes did not exhibit clear variations.\nFurther analysis indicated that while these relativistic electrons originated\nfrom the X-line, they experienced a non-negligible degree of scattering during\ntransport. These findings provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection in\nEarth's magnetotail can efficiently energize relativistic electrons directly at\nthe X-line, providing new insights into the complex processes governing\nelectron dynamics during magnetic reconnection.",

The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on\nthe Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the\nexisting methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain\nthe prespecified confidence level t $\\in$ (0,1) asymptotically. A theoretical\nproof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval\nup or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to\nchoose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the\nresponse variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is\nshown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response\nvariable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can\ntrade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single\noptimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI\nthrough re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the\ngradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Tube\nLoss-based PI estimation in both kernel machines and neural networks.\nAdditionally, we show that Tube Loss-based deep probabilistic forecasting\nmodels achieve superior performance compared to existing probabilistic\nforecasting techniques across several benchmark and wind datasets.

However, EEG signals suffer from inter- and intra-subject\nvariability, leading to poor performance. Recent technological advancements\nhave led to deep learning (DL) models that have achieved high performance in\nvarious fields. However, such large models are compute- and resource-intensive\nand are a bottleneck for real-time neural decoding. Data distribution shift can\nbe handled with the help of domain adaptation techniques of transfer learning\n(fine-tuning) and adversarial training that requires model parameter updates\naccording to the target domain. One such recent technique is\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which requires only a small fraction of\nthe total trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the whole model.\nTherefore, we explored PEFT methods for adapting EEG-based mental imagery\ntasks. We considered two mental imagery tasks: speech imagery and motor\nimagery, as both of these tasks are instrumental in post-stroke\nneuro-rehabilitation. We proposed a novel ensemble of weight-decomposed\nlow-rank adaptation methods, EDoRA, for parameter-efficient mental imagery task\nadaptation through EEG signal classification. The performance of the proposed\nPEFT method is validated on two publicly available datasets, one speech\nimagery, and the other motor imagery dataset.

In this\npaper, we apply the improved multisynchrosqueezing transform (IMSST) method to\nreconstruct simulated GW data based on the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein\nTelescope (ET) detectors. These data are generated by the magnetorotational and\nneutrino-driven mechanisms, and we use the match score as the criterion for\nevaluating the quality of the reconstruction. To assess whether the\nreconstructed waveforms correspond to true GW signals, we calculate the false\nalarm probability of reconstruction (FAPR). For GW sources located at 10 kpc\nand datasets where the waveform amplitudes are normalized to $5 \\times\n10^{-21}$ observed by aLIGO, FAPR are $2.1 \\times 10^{-2}$ and $6.2 \\times\n10^{-3}$, respectively. For GW sources at 100 kpc and with waveform amplitudes\nnormalized to $5 \\times 10^{-21}$ observed by ET, FAPR are $1.3 \\times 10^{-1}$\nand $1.5 \\times 10^{-2}$, respectively. When the gravitational wave strain\nreaches $7 \\times 10^{-21}$ and the match score threshold is set to 0.75, the\nIMSST method achieves maximum reconstruction distances of approximately 37 kpc\nand 317 kpc for aLIGO and ET, respectively.

Balancing real-time speed against high-quality results is\na persistent challenge, mainly due to the high computational demands of\nexisting 3D representations. To address this, we propose Fourier Occupancy\nField (FOF), an efficient 3D representation by learning the Fourier series. The\ncore of FOF is to factorize a 3D occupancy field into a 2D vector field,\nretaining topology and spatial relationships within the 3D domain while\nfacilitating compatibility with 2D convolutional neural networks. Such a\nrepresentation bridges the gap between 3D and 2D domains, enabling the\nintegration of human parametric models as priors and enhancing the\nreconstruction robustness. Based on FOF, we design a new reconstruction\nframework, FOF-X, to avoid the performance degradation caused by texture and\nlighting. This enables our real-time reconstruction system to better handle the\ndomain gap between training images and real images. Additionally, in FOF-X, we\nenhance the inter-conversion algorithms between FOF and mesh representations\nwith a Laplacian constraint and an automaton-based discontinuity matcher,\nimproving both quality and robustness. We validate the strengths of our\napproach on different datasets and real-captured data, where FOF-X achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results.

For the\nsynthetic antiferromagnets consisting of Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt layers, two kinds of\nfilm growth parameters are examined: the effects of epitaxial growth and\noblique incident of sputter-deposition. The present results indicate that the\nspatial fluctuations in thicknesses are one of the major sources inducing the\nAIEC while the epitaxial growth, which leads to the sharp interfaces and the\nuniformity in layer thicknesses, effectively suppresses the unexpected AIEC. In\naddition, the oblique sputter-deposition provides the large AIEC and the\nanisotropic distribution of AIEC direction in the case of textured films.

To enhance the performance further, an additional\npretraining stage with large scale audio data is typically required to infuse\naudio specific knowledge into the vision model.

In\nthis work, we propose bypassing the pretraining stage by directly fine-tuning\nthe vision model with our Look Aside Adapter (LoAA) designed for efficient\naudio understanding. Audio spectrum data is represented across two\nheterogeneous dimensions time and frequency and we refine adapters to\nfacilitate interactions between tokens across these dimensions.

However, due to the\nopen nature of UAV channels, security issue requires special consideration.\nThis paper proposes a dual UAV cluster-assisted system via CB to achieve\nphysical layer security in maritime wireless communications. Specifically, one\nUAV cluster forms a maritime UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (MUVAA) relay to\nforward data signals to the remote legitimate vessel, and the other UAV cluster\nforms an MUVAA jammer to send jamming signals to the remote eavesdropper. In\nthis system, we formulate a secure and energy-efficient maritime communication\nmulti-objective optimization problem (SEMCMOP) to maximize the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the legitimate vessel,\nminimize the SINR of the eavesdropping vessel and minimize the total flight\nenergy consumption of UAVs.

LRDs\nare currently subjects of debate as the mechanisms behind their high\nluminosities are not yet fully understood. LRD energy outputs are thought to be\neither dominated by star formation or their energy output results from the\nhosting of active galactic nuclei. We investigate the starburst hypothesis by\nattempting to replicate the stellar properties of LRDs using output data from\nthe FLARES simulation suite. Comparative analysis of galactic properties such\nas galactic number density, stellar mass and star formation rate yield\nsignificant tension between simulated and observed galaxies. The FLARES\nsimulation overestimates the number densities of galaxies with stellar masses\nsimilar to observed LRDs by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the\nsimulation shows an overestimation of star formation rates. These tensions\nsuggest a potential underestimation by the FLARES model of stellar feedback\nmechanisms such as active galactic nuclei feedback. These results suggest that\nthe starburst hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the observed properties\nof these galaxies. Instead, the AGN scenario should be further investigated by\nrepeating the methods in this study with a hydrodynamic galaxy simulation suite\nthat models a higher influence of AGN feedback mechanisms on stellar activity\nin high redshift galaxies.",

There are two main\ncontributions in this thesis.\n  The first main contribution concerns a special class of S-FGs where the\npartition function of each S-FG equals the permanent of a nonnegative square\nmatrix. The Bethe partition function for such an S-FG is called the Bethe\npermanent. A combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent is given by\nthe degree-$M$ Bethe permanent, which is defined based on the degree-$M$ graph\ncovers of the underlying S-FG. In this thesis, we prove a\ndegree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based lower bound on the permanent of a non-negative\nsquare matrix, resolving a conjecture proposed by Vontobel in [IEEE Trans. Inf.\nTheory, Mar. 2013]. We also prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based upper\nbound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. In the limit $M \\to \\infty$,\nthese lower and upper bounds yield known Bethe-permanent-based lower and upper\nbounds on the permanent of a non-negative square matrix.\n  The second main contribution is giving a combinatorial characterization of\nthe Bethe partition function for DE-FGs in terms of finite graph covers. In\ngeneral, approximating the partition function of a DE-FG is more challenging\nthan for an S-FG because the partition function of the DE-FG is a sum of\ncomplex values and not just a sum of non-negative real values. Moreover, one\ncannot apply the method of types for proving the combinatorial characterization\nas in the case of S-FGs. We overcome this challenge by applying a suitable\nloop-calculus transform (LCT) for both S-FGs and DE-FGs. Currently, we provide\na combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of\nfinite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs satisfying an (easily checkable)\ncondition.",

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately predict and analyze student performance in online\neducation, both at the outset and throughout the semester, is vital. Most of\nthe published studies focus on binary classification (Fail or Pass) but there\nis still a significant research gap in predicting students' performance across\nmultiple categories. This study introduces a novel neural network-based\napproach capable of accurately predicting student performance and identifying\nvulnerable students at early stages of the online courses. The Open University\nLearning Analytics (OULA) dataset is employed to develop and test the proposed\nmodel, which predicts outcomes in Distinction, Fail, Pass, and Withdrawn\ncategories. The OULA dataset is preprocessed to extract features from\ndemographic data, assessment data, and clickstream interactions within a\nVirtual Learning Environment (VLE). Comparative simulations indicate that the\nproposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline models including\nArtificial Neural Network Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM), Random Forest (RF)\n'gini', RF 'entropy' and Deep Feed Forward Neural Network (DFFNN) in terms of\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the\nprediction accuracy of the proposed method is about 25% more than the existing\nstate-of-the-art. Furthermore, compared to existing methodologies, the model\ndemonstrates superior predictive capability across temporal course progression,\nachieving superior accuracy even at the initial 20% phase of course completion.",

Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks,\ndesigning effective jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given\nthe highly constrained adversarial capabilities in real-world deployment\nscenarios. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting\nin limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced\nmultimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which is\nblack-box and consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy\nand heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution\nstrategy is used to distribute harmful semantics into multiple modalities to\neffectively circumvent the single-modality protection mechanisms of MLLMs. The\nheuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the\nunderstanding-enhancing prompt, which helps MLLMs reconstruct the malicious\nprompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative\noutputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. HIMRD achieves\nan average attack success rate (ASR) of 90% across seven open-source MLLMs and\nan average ASR of around 68% in three closed-source MLLMs. HIMRD reveals\ncross-modal security vulnerabilities in current MLLMs and underscores the\nimperative for developing defensive strategies to mitigate such emerging risks.\nCode is available at https://github.com/MaTengSYSU/HIMRD-jailbreak.",

    "abstract": "A composite impurity in a metal can explore different configurations, where\nits net magnetic moment may be screened by the host electrons. An example is\nthe two-stage Kondo (TSK) system, where screening occurs at successively\nsmaller energy scales. Alternatively, impurities may prefer a local singlet\ndisconnected from the metal. This competition is influenced by the system's\ncouplings. A double quantum dot T-shape geometry, where a \"hanging\" dot is\nconnected to current leads only via another dot, allows experimental\nexploration of these regimes. Differentiating the two regimes has been\nchallenging. This study provides a method to identify the TSK regime in such a\ngeometry. The TSK regime requires a balance between the inter-dot coupling\n($t_{01}$) and the coupling of the quantum dot connected to the Fermi sea\n($\\Gamma_0$). Above a certain ratio, the system transitions to a molecular\nregime, forming a local singlet with no Kondo screening. The study identifies a\nregion in the $t_{01}$--$\\Gamma_0$ parameter space where a pure TSK regime\noccurs. Here, the second Kondo stage properties can be described by a single\nimpurity Anderson model with effective parameters. By examining the magnetic\nsusceptibility of the hanging quantum dot, a single parameter, $\\Gamma_{\\rm\neff}$, can simulate this susceptibility accurately. This effective model also\nprovides the hanging quantum dot's spectral function accurately within a\nlimited parameter range, defining the true TSK regime. Additionally, spin\ncorrelations between the quantum dots show universal behavior in this parameter\nrange. These findings can guide experimental groups in selecting parameter\nvalues to place the system in either the TSK regime or the crossover to the\nmolecular regime.",

    "abstract": "Distilling 3D representations from pretrained 2D diffusion models is\nessential for 3D creative applications across gaming, film, and interior\ndesign. Current SDS-based methods are hindered by inefficient information\ndistillation from diffusion models, which prevents the creation of\nphotorealistic 3D contents. In this paper, we first reevaluate the SDS approach\nby analyzing its fundamental nature as a basic image editing process that\ncommonly results in over-saturation, over-smoothing, lack of rich content and\ndiversity due to the poor-quality single-step denoising. In light of this, we\nthen propose a novel method called 3D Generation by Editing (GE3D). Each\niteration of GE3D utilizes a 2D editing framework that combines a noising\ntrajectory to preserve the information of the input image, alongside a\ntext-guided denoising trajectory. We optimize the process by aligning the\nlatents across both trajectories. This approach fully exploits pretrained\ndiffusion models to distill multi-granularity information through multiple\ndenoising steps, resulting in photorealistic 3D outputs. Both theoretical and\nexperimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, which not only\nadvances 3D generation technology but also establishes a novel connection\nbetween 3D generation and 2D editing.

However, the\nexpensive computation and massive parameters of DMs hinder their practical use\nin resource-constrained scenarios. As one of the effective compression\napproaches, quantization allows DMs to achieve storage saving and inference\nacceleration by reducing bit-width while maintaining generation performance.\nHowever, as the most extreme quantization form, 1-bit binarization causes the\ngeneration performance of DMs to face severe degradation or even collapse.

This\ncharacterization allows us to compartmentalise the total mosquito population\ninto distinct compartments according to the spatial location of the mosquito\n(breeding site, resting places and questing places) as well as blood-fed\nstatus. Issues of overcrowding and intraspecific competition both within the\naquatic and the terrestrial stages of the mosquito's life forms are addressed\nand considered in the model. Results show that the inclusion of mating induces\nbi-stability; a phenomenon whereby locally stable trivial and non-trivial\nequilibria co-exist with an unstable non-zero equilibrium. The local nature of\nthe stable equilibria is demonstrated by numerically showing that the long-term\nstate of the system is sensitive to initial conditions. The bi-stability state\nis analogous to the phenomenon of the Allee effect that has been reported in\npopulation biology. The model's results, including the derivation of the\nthreshold parameter of the system, are comprehensively tested via numerical\nsimulations. The output of our model has direct application to mosquito control\nstrategies, for it clearly shows key points in the mosquito's developmental\npathway that can be targeted for control purposes.",

To validate this model, we assess the\napplicability of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and the maximum\nentropy condition within this framework. We derive a generalized form of the\nHubble parameter for this model, demonstrating that it converges to the\nstandard Hubble parameter in the non-merger case (\\(\\xi = 0\\)). The merging\nmodel's equation of state parameters resembles those of evolving dark matter\nand dark energy, with \\(w_c(z) \\simeq w_{\\rm dm} \\simeq 0\\) and \\(w_v(z) \\simeq\nw_{\\rm de} \\simeq -1\\) at $z\\rightarrow 0$, aligning with recent observations.\nWe attribute the roles of dynamical dark matter and dark energy to super-voids\nand super-clusters, the largest merging objects in the web-like universe. We\ncompare our model by analyzing the Hubble parameter and the entropy along with\nits first and second derivatives for the $w$CDM and standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodels. Our plots indicate that the models incorporating only cluster mergers\nexhibit greater discrepancies with both observational Hubble parameters and the\nstandard model at $z > 1$. A key finding is that in models featuring only\ncluster mergers, Hubble and entropy rates consistently decrease.

The generative depth refinement module employs a diffusion-based\nstrategy to enhance geometric details and fidelity while preserving the scale.\nFinally, for Gaussian splatting optimization, we propose a multimodal loss\nfunction incorporating depth and normal consistency, geometric regularization,\nand pseudo-view supervision, providing robust guidance under sparse-view\nconditions. Experiments on widely used datasets show that GBR significantly\noutperforms existing methods under sparse-view inputs. Additionally, GBR\ndemonstrates the ability to reconstruct and render large-scale real-world\nscenes, such as the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Great Wall, with remarkable\ndetails using only 6 views.",

The GPD is defined as an integer-valued function whose domain is the\nset of intervals in the indexing poset of a persistence module, and is known to\nbe able to capture richer topological information than its single-parameter\ncounterpart. However, computing the GPD is computationally prohibitive due to\nthe sheer size of the interval set. Restricting the GPD to a subset of\nintervals provides a way to manage this complexity, compromising discriminating\npower to some extent. However, identifying and computing an effective\nrestriction of the domain that minimizes the loss of discriminating power\nremains an open challenge.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel method for optimizing the domain of the\nGPD through gradient descent optimization. To achieve this, we introduce a loss\nfunction tailored to optimize the selection of intervals, balancing\ncomputational efficiency and discriminative accuracy. The design of the loss\nfunction is based on the known erosion stability property of the GPD. We\nshowcase the efficiency of our sparsification method for dataset classification\nin supervised machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nsparsification method significantly reduces the time required for computing the\nGPDs associated to several datasets, while maintaining classification\naccuracies comparable to those achieved using full GPDs.

However,\ncaching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly\nexhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs,\nparticularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory\nconsumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on\ninference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the\nstatic cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper\nobserves that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on\naccuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical\nvalidation.

To overcome these limitations, we\npropose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for\ntoxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by\nextracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM\nand embedding these features into a benign image as prior information.\nSubsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal\ninteraction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations\nin an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity\nof the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a\nwell-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average\nattack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on\nthree closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially\ndisturbing and offensive content.",

It has broad applications in healthcare, and deep learning methods\nhave enabled significant advancements in automating this process. Recently, the\nintroduction of the Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), the first foundation\nmodel for segmentation task, has prompted researchers to adapt it for the\nmedical domain to improve performance across various tasks. However, SAM's\nlarge model size and high GPU requirements hinder its scalability and\ndevelopment in the medical domain. In this work, we propose MCP-MedSAM, a\npowerful and lightweight medical SAM model designed to be trainable on a single\nA100 GPU with 40GB of memory within one day while delivering superior\nsegmentation performance. Recognizing the significant internal differences\nbetween modalities and the need for direct segmentation target information\nwithin bounding boxes, we introduce two kinds of prompts: the modality prompt\nand the content prompt. After passing through the prompt encoder, their\nembedding representations can further improve the segmentation performance by\nincorporating more relevant information without adding significant training\noverhead. Additionally, we adopt an effective modality-based data sampling\nstrategy to address data imbalance between modalities, ensuring more balanced\nperformance across all modalities. Our method was trained and evaluated using a\nlarge-scale challenge dataset, compared to top-ranking methods on the challenge\nleaderboard, MCP-MedSAM achieved superior performance while requiring only one\nday of training on a single GPU.

Analog simulators\nlike SPICE iteratively solve the differential equations characterizing the\ncircuits components numerically. Although unrivaled in accuracy, this is only\nfeasible for small designs, due to the high computational effort even for short\nsignal traces. Digital simulators use digital abstractions for predicting the\ntiming behavior of a circuit. Besides static timing analysis, which performs\ncorner-case analysis of critical path delays only, dynamic timing analysis\nprovides per-transition timing information in signal traces. In this paper, we\nadvocate a novel approach, which generalizes digital traces to traces\nconsisting of sigmoids, each parameterized by threshold crossing time and\nslope. What is needed to compute the output trace of a gate is a transfer\nfunction, which determines the parameters of the output sigmoids given the\nparameters of the input sigmoids. Harnessing the power of artificial neural\nnetworks (ANN), we implement such transfer functions via ANNs. Using inverters\nand NOR as the elementary gates in a prototype implementation of a specifically\ntailored simulator, we demonstrate that our approach operates substantially\nfaster than an analog simulator, while offering better accuracy than a digital\nsimulator.",

    "abstract": "3D medical image analysis is pivotal in numerous clinical applications.\nHowever, the scarcity of labeled data and limited generalization capabilities\nhinder the advancement of AI-empowered models. Radiology reports are easily\naccessible and can serve as weakly-supervised signals. However, large-scale\nvision-language pre-training (VLP) remains underexplored in 3D medical image\nanalysis. Specifically, the insufficient investigation into multi-grained\nradiology semantics and their correlations across patients leads to\nunderutilization of large-scale volume-report data.\n  Considering intra-patient cross-modal semantic consistency and inter-patient\nsemantic correlations, we propose a multi-task VLP method, MG-3D, pre-trained\non large-scale data (47.1K), addressing the challenges by the following two\naspects: 1) Establishing the correspondence between volume semantics and\nmulti-grained medical knowledge of each patient with cross-modal global\nalignment and complementary modality-guided local reconstruction, ensuring\nintra-patient features of different modalities cohesively represent the same\nsemantic content; 2) Correlating inter-patient visual semantics based on\nfine-grained report correlations across patients, and keeping sensitivity to\nglobal individual differences via contrastive learning, enhancing the\ndiscriminative feature representation. Furthermore, we delve into the scaling\nlaw to explore potential performance improvements.

This\nimbalance may result in pointcloud registration becoming trapped in local\noptima, thereby exacerbating drift during long-term and large-scale\nlocalization. To this end, we propose a novel LIO framework with selective\nintra-frame smoothing dubbed AC-LIO.

Interestingly, in a three-level system, the parity-time\nsymmetry-breaking can lead to a third-order exceptional point with distinctive\ntopological properties and enhanced sensitivity. To experimentally implement\nthis in open quantum systems, it is essential to introduce two well-controlled\nloss channels. However, the requirement for these two loss channels presents a\nchallenge in experimental implementation due to the lack of methods to realize\nthe dynamics governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

In particular, we perform quantum state tomography to\ndirectly demonstrate the coalescence of three eigenstates into a single\neigenstate at the exceptional point. Finally, we identify an intrinsic third\norder Liouvillian exceptional point associated with a parity-time symmetry\nbreaking via quench dynamics.

Using a new\ndifferentiable forward model, Riner can jointly learn the implicit neural\nrepresentation of artifact-free images and estimate the physical parameters\ndirectly from CT measurements, without external training data.

In the first stage, agents analyze their respective schema and\ncommunicate with each other to collect the schema information relevant to the\nquestion. In the second stage, agents try to generate the corresponding SQL\nquery for the question using the collected information. In the third stage,\nagents check if the SQL query is created correctly according to their known\ninformation. This interaction-based method makes the question-relevant part of\ndatabase schema from each agent to be used for SQL generation and check.\nExperiments on the Spider and Bird benckmark demonstrate that CSMA achieves a\nhigh performance level comparable to the state-of-the-arts, meanwhile holding\nthe private data in these individual agents.",

There is a crucial limitation: these works\nassume the training dataset of the target model is known beforehand and\nleverage this dataset for model attribute attack.

As a result, bounding box prediction using\npoint-level supervision emerges as a natural and cost-effective alternative to\ntraditional box-level supervision. However, the small scale and lack of\ndistinctive features of tiny objects make point annotations prone to noise,\nposing significant hurdles for model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose Point Teacher--the first end-to-end point-supervised method for robust\ntiny object detection in aerial images. To handle label noise from scale\nambiguity and location shifts in point annotations, Point Teacher employs the\nteacher-student architecture and decouples the learning into a two-phase\ndenoising process. In this framework, the teacher network progressively\ndenoises the pseudo boxes derived from noisy point annotations, guiding the\nstudent network's learning. Specifically, in the first phase, random masking of\nimage regions facilitates regression learning, enabling the teacher to\ntransform noisy point annotations into coarse pseudo boxes. In the second\nphase, these coarse pseudo boxes are refined using dynamic multiple instance\nlearning, which adaptively selects the most reliable instance from dynamically\nconstructed proposal bags around the coarse pseudo boxes. Extensive experiments\non three tiny object datasets (i.e., AI-TOD-v2, SODA-A, and TinyPerson)\nvalidate the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness against point\nlocation shifts.

    "abstract": "Metastructures are engineered systems composed of periodic arrays of\nidentical components, called resonators, designed to achieve specific dynamic\neffects, such as creating a band gap-a frequency range where waves cannot\npropagate through the structure. When equipped with patches of piezoelectric\nmaterial, these metastructures exhibit an additional capability: they can\nharvest energy effectively even from frequencies much lower than the\nfundamental frequency of an individual resonator. This energy harvesting\ncapability is particularly valuable for applications where low-frequency\nvibrations dominate. To support the design of metastructures for dual purposes,\nsuch as energy harvesting and vibration suppression (reducing unwanted\noscillations in the structure), we develop a multi-patch isogeometric model of\na piezoelectric energy harvester. This model is based on a piezoelectric\nKirchhoff-Love plate-a thin, flexible structure with embedded piezoelectric\npatches-and uses Nitsche's method to enforce compatibility conditions in terms\nof displacement, rotations, shear force, and bending moments across the\nboundaries of different patches. The model is validated against experimental\nand numerical data from the literature. We then present a novel, parameterized\nmetastructure plate design and conduct a parametric study to explore how\nresonator geometries affect key performance metrics, including the location and\nwidth of the band gap and the position of the first peak in the voltage\nfrequency response function. This model can be integrated with optimization\nalgorithms to maximize outcomes such as energy harvesting efficiency or\nvibration reduction, depending on application needs.",

Results: Analysis indicates a high\nprevalence of MetS and Pre-MetS, particularly among females, with significant\npredictors including BMI, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and waist\ncircumference, alongside socio-genetic and lifestyle factors. Employing Elastic\nNet logistic regression, the researcher rigorously validated models to evaluate\ntheir predictive performance while also describing the associations and\nprevalence of known risk factors.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph\ndata, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing\nattacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to\nextract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading\nto academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities.\nPrevious studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore\ncross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge\nof multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data\nknowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which\ncan be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be\nextracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability\nwill be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing\nattack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and Large Language Models\n(LLMs). The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures\nin cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific\ndataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model\nmerging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models\neffectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization\ncapabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers' datasets\nbut also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive\nexperiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further\nillustrate the generality of our approach.",

Advances in this area have introduced CoT models,\nspecifically designed to integrate CoT reasoning effectively into language\nmodels, achieving notable improvements in code generation. Despite these\nadvancements, the security of CoT models has not been systematically studied.\nIn this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating the vulnerability of\nCoT models to backdoor injection in code generation tasks. To address this, we\npropose a model-agnostic backdoor attack method SABER (Self-Attention-BasEd\nbackdooR) based on the self-attention mechanism. SABER begins by selecting a\nmalicious output as the backdoor using code mutation operations. It then\nidentifies the tokens most relevant to poisoned content by analyzing\nself-attention scores in the CodeBERT model. Finally, it mimicks user behavior\nto generate adaptive and natural triggers. Our experiments on HumanEval-CoT and\nOpenEval-CoT test sets demonstrate that CoT models are susceptible to backdoor\nattacks via data poisoning. Taking the HumanEval-CoT dataset as an example,\nSABER achieves an ASR of 80.95%, representing an improvement of 33.33% over\nRIPPLe and a substantial 4.76% enhancement compared to BadPre. Further\nevaluations using ONION for automated detection and human studies reveal that\nSABER is stealthier and harder to detect, bypassing 61.90% of automated\ndetection, with a human detection rate of just 3.17%. Our findings reveal that\nbackdoors can be injected into CoT models to manipulate downstream code\ngeneration tasks. This highlights the urgent need for further research to\nunderstand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities in CoT models.",

For FFT, we propose an\narchitecture-aware, padding-free, and template-based prototype to maximize\nhardware resource utilization, achieving a competitive or superior performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art closed-source library, cuFFT. For fault\ntolerance, we 1) explore algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) at the thread\nand threadblock levels to reduce additional memory footprint, 2) address the\nerror propagation by introducing a two-side ABFT with location encoding, and 3)\nfurther modify the threadblock-level FFT from 1-transaction to\nmulti-transaction in order to bring more parallelism for ABFT. Our two-side\nstrategy enables online correction without additional global memory while our\nmulti-transaction design averages the expensive threadblock-level reduction in\nABFT with zero additional operations. Experimental results on an NVIDIA A100\nserver GPU and a Tesla Turing T4 GPU demonstrate that TurboFFT without fault\ntolerance is comparable to or up to 300\\% faster than cuFFT and outperforms\nVkFFT.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent machine learning paradigm\nin edge computing environments, enabling edge devices to collaboratively\noptimize a global model without sharing their private data. However, existing\nFL frameworks suffer from efficacy deterioration due to the system\nheterogeneity inherent in edge computing, especially in the presence of domain\nshifts across local data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous FL\nframework DapperFL, to enhance model performance across multiple domains. In\nDapperFL, we introduce a dedicated Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module to produce\npersonalized compact local models for clients to address the system\nheterogeneity challenges. The MFP module prunes local models with fused\nknowledge obtained from both local and remaining domains, ensuring robustness\nto domain shifts. Additionally, we design a Domain Adaptive Regularization\n(DAR) module to further improve the overall performance of DapperFL. The DAR\nmodule employs regularization generated by the pruned model, aiming to learn\nrobust representations across domains. Furthermore, we introduce a specific\naggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous local models with tailored\narchitectures and weights. We implement DapperFL on a realworld FL platform\nwith heterogeneous clients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DapperFL outperforms several state-of-the-art\nFL frameworks by up to 2.28%, while significantly achieving model volume\nreductions ranging from 20% to 80%.

    "abstract": "Recent research on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) typically follows two approaches: LLM-centered models, which\nconvert graph data into tokens for LLM processing, and GNN-centered models,\nwhich use LLMs to encode text features into node and edge representations for\nGNN input. LLM-centered models often struggle to capture graph structures\neffectively, while GNN-centered models compress variable-length textual data\ninto fixed-size vectors, limiting their ability to understand complex\nsemantics. Additionally, GNN-centered approaches require converting tasks into\na uniform, manually-designed format, restricting them to classification tasks\nand preventing language output. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nnew architecture that deeply integrates GNN with LLM, featuring three key\ninnovations: (1) Structure-Aware Transformers, which incorporate GNN's\nmessage-passing capabilities directly into LLM's transformer layers, allowing\nsimultaneous processing of textual and structural information and generating\noutputs from both GNN and LLM; (2) Graph-Text Cross-Attention, which processes\nfull, uncompressed text from graph nodes and edges, ensuring complete semantic\nintegration; and (3) GNN-LLM Twin Predictor, enabling LLM's flexible\nautoregressive generation alongside GNN's scalable one-pass prediction.\nGL-Fusion achieves outstand performance on various tasks.

However, their efficient deployment remains a\nsubstantial challenge due to high computational costs and memory requirements.\nRecognizing the redundancy of information within the vision modality, recent\nstudies have explored methods for compressing visual tokens in MLLMs to enhance\nefficiency in a training-free manner. Despite their effectiveness, existing\nmethods like Fast rely on the attention between visual tokens and prompt text\ntokens as the importance indicator, overlooking the relevance to response text\nand thus introducing perception bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that in\nMLLMs, the [CLS] token in the visual encoder inherently knows which visual\ntokens are important for MLLMs. Building on this prior, we introduce a simple\nyet effective method for train-free visual token compression, called VTC-CLS.\nFirstly, it leverages the attention score of the [CLS] token on visual tokens\nas an importance indicator for pruning visual tokens.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our VTC-CLS achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance across various tasks compared with baseline methods.

We employ Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for\nthe first time on data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope to systematically search for periodicity using 28-day\nbinned light curves. We aim to isolate any potential periodic nature of the\nemission from trends and noise, reducing uncertainties in revealing\nperiodicity. Additionally, we characterize long-term trends and develop a\nforecasting algorithm based on SSA to predict future emission behavior. We\napply SSA to analyze 494 sources detected by Fermi-LAT, focusing on isolating\noscillatory components from trends and noise in their $\\gamma$-ray light\ncurves. We compute the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram for oscillatory components\nextracted by SSA to determine the most significant periods, assessing their\nlocal and global significance.

Utilizing the concept of\nthermodynamical topology, we examine these black holes as topological\nthermodynamic defects, classifying them into distinct topological categories\nbased on their generalized free energy. We find that the Hawking temperature of\nthe black hole has at least one zero point at the small horizon radius limit.\nUnder this fact, the regular black holes generated through the purely\ngravitational theories exhibit universal thermodynamical behaviors, strongly\nsuggesting they belong to the same topological class.

We start with a size estimator to establish a clear\nrelationship between file size and hyperparameters. Leveraging this estimator,\nwe incorporate mixed precision quantization (MPQ) into 3DGS attributes,\nstructuring MPQ in two hierarchical level -- inter-attribute and\nintra-attribute -- to optimize visual quality under the size constraint. At the\ninter-attribute level, we assign bit-widths to each attribute channel by\nformulating the combinatorial optimization as a 0-1 integer linear program,\nwhich can be efficiently solved. At the intra-attribute level, we divide each\nattribute channel into blocks of vectors, quantizing each vector based on the\noptimal bit-width derived at the inter-attribute level. Dynamic programming\ndetermines block lengths. Using the size estimator and MPQ, we develop a\ncalibrated algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters in just 10 minutes,\nachieving a 1.69$\\times$ efficiency increase with quality comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that\nthis bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and\npersists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter\ndistribution.

Existing methods typically use graph indexing to ensure the\nefficiency of path planning. However, in real-world road networks, road\nsegments may impose restrictions in terms of height, width, and weight. Most\nexisting works ignore these road restrictions when building indices, which\nresults in returning infeasible paths for vehicles. To address this, a naive\napproach is to build separate indices for each combination of different types\nof restrictions. However, this approach leads to a substantial number of\nindices, as the number of combinations grows explosively with the increase in\ndifferent restrictions on road segments. In this paper, we propose a novel path\nplanning method, TRAPP(Traffic Restrictions Adaptive Path Planning algorithm),\nwhich utilizes traffic flow data from the road network to filter out rarely\nused road restriction combinations, retain frequently used road restriction\ncombinations, and build indices for them. Additionally, we introduce two\noptimizations aimed at reducing redundant path information storage within the\nindices and enhancing the speed of index matching.

    "abstract": "Using the time-dependent Lanczos method, we study the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of the half-filled one-dimensional ionic Hubbard model, deep within\nthe Mott insulating regime, under the influence of a transient laser pulse. In\nequilibrium, increasing the staggered potential in the Mott regime reduces the\nMott gap and broadens the Hubbard bands, creating favorable conditions for\nimpact ionization. After laser excitation, impact ionization is observed, with\nits occurrence depending on both the staggered potential and the laser pump\nfrequency. By analyzing the time evolution of the kinetic, ionic, and Coulomb\ninteraction energies, we identify a novel mechanism for impact ionization, in\nwhich excess ionic potential energy is converted into additional double\noccupancy-distinct from the conventional mechanism where excess kinetic energy\ndrives this process. We further show that impact ionization arises from\ninterference between excited states driven by photon excitation of the same\norder. These results present a new pathway for realizing impact ionization in\nstrongly correlated electron systems.",

    "abstract": "Image tokenization, the process of transforming raw image pixels into a\ncompact low-dimensional latent representation, has proven crucial for scalable\nand efficient image generation. However, mainstream image tokenization methods\ngenerally have limited compression rates, making high-resolution image\ngeneration computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose to\nleverage language for efficient image tokenization, and we call our method\nText-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective\ntokenization framework that leverages language to provide a compact, high-level\nsemantic representation. By conditioning the tokenization process on\ndescriptive text captions, TexTok simplifies semantic learning, allowing more\nlearning capacity and token space to be allocated to capture fine-grained\nvisual details, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher\ncompression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text\nconditioning, TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2%\nand 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively, across varying\nnumbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to\n16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the\ntokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok, our system can achieve a\n93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only\n32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves\nstate-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512\nrespectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the\ntext-to-image generation task, effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text\ncaptions in tokenization.

Despite its importance, the cause of this\nunexpectedly low human loss was unclear because of the limited access to the\npeninsula and the presence of many visitors during the holiday, which made\nconducting conventional surveys infeasible. Here, we reveal evacuation\nbehaviour during the 2024 Noto Peninsula tsunami using massive geolocation data\ncollected from a smartphone app. By analysing these massive data, which include\nover 1.5 million records collected on this day, we find that the evacuation was\nextremely fast, occurring within 2--6 minutes after the origin time. Further\nanalyses suggest that these fast departures were driven mainly by strong ground\nshaking; the fact that the tsunami occurred during the family-oriented New Year\nholiday was also a key factor. Additionally, the long-term analysis of the data\nreveals that people started returning to the coastal area 20--100 minutes after\nthe origin time, which was long before the downgrading and cancellation of the\ntsunami warnings. These results highlight the utility of the innovative\ndata-driven approach to evacuation surveys, which addresses the limitations of\nconventional evacuation surveys.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Bayesian factor-augmented bundle choice model to\nestimate joint consumption as well as the substitutability and complementarity\nof multiple goods in the presence of endogenous regressors. The model extends\nthe two primary treatments of endogeneity in existing bundle choice models: (1)\nendogenous market-level prices and (2) time-invariant unobserved individual\nheterogeneity. A Bayesian sparse factor approach is employed to capture\nhigh-dimensional error correlations that induce taste correlation and\nendogeneity. Time-varying factor loadings allow for more general\nindividual-level and time-varying heterogeneity and endogeneity, while the\nsparsity induced by the shrinkage prior on loadings balances flexibility with\nparsimony. Applied to a soda tax in the context of complementarities, the new\napproach captures broader effects of the tax that were previously overlooked.\nResults suggest that a soda tax could yield additional health benefits by\nmarginally decreasing the consumption of salty snacks along with sugary drinks,\nextending the health benefits beyond the reduction in sugar consumption alone.",

No momentum or other\nalgorithmic modifications are required. This result is incomparable to the\n(deterministic) Silver Stepsize Schedule which does not require separability\nbut only achieves partial acceleration $O(k^{\\log_{1+\\sqrt{2}} 2}) \\approx\nO(k^{0.78})$. Our starting point is a conceptual connection to potential\ntheory: the variational characterization for the distribution of stepsizes with\nfastest convergence rate mirrors the variational characterization for the\ndistribution of charged particles with minimal logarithmic potential energy.\nThe Arcsine distribution solves both variational characterizations due to a\nremarkable \"equalization property\" which in the physical context amounts to a\nconstant potential over space, and in the optimization context amounts to an\nidentical convergence rate over all quadratic functions. A key technical\ninsight is that martingale arguments extend this phenomenon to all separable\nconvex functions.

    "abstract": "With the advent of diffusion models, new proteins can be generated at an\nunprecedented rate.

While models have been trained to take the motif as\nconditional input, recent techniques in diffusion posterior sampling can be\nleveraged as zero-shot alternatives whose approximations can be corrected with\nsequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new set\nof guidance potentials to describe and solve scaffolding tasks by adapting\nSMC-aided diffusion posterior samplers with an unconditional model, Genie,\nacting as a prior. Against established benchmarks, we successfully scaffold\nseveral single-motif and multi-motif problems.

In\nthe single-motif case, we find these potentials perform comparably to the\nconventional masking approach and that reconstruction guidance outperforms\nreplacement methods when aided with SMC.

This increase\ncan be interpreted as a consequence of superburst radiation depleting the inner\naccretion disk, leading to a near-complete quenching of the persistent\nemission. As the burst radiation decayed, the inner accretion disk gradually\nreturned to its preburst state, as evidenced by the best-fit spectral\nparameters. Additionally, we observed a prominent absorption line that\nexhibited a gravitational redshift, shifting from 4.15 to 3.62 keV during the\nrecovery phase of persistent emission. This absorption feature likely\noriginates from the inner accretion disk rather than from burst emission on the\nneutron star (NS) surface. The observed changes in the absorption line energy\nsuggest that the inner disk approached the NS to a distance as close as\n$\\approx17$ km.",

However, existing system call interception tools on the\nARM platform still suffer from limitations in terms of performance and\ncompleteness. This paper presents an efficient and comprehensive binary\nrewriting framework, ASC-Hook, specifically designed for intercepting system\ncalls on the ARM platform. ASC-Hook addresses two key challenges on the ARM\narchitecture: the misalignment of the target address caused by directly\nreplacing the SVC instruction with br x8, and the return to the original\ncontrol flow after system call interception. This is achieved through a hybrid\nreplacement strategy and our specially designed trampoline mechanism. By\nimplementing multiple completeness strategies specifically for system calls, we\nensured comprehensive and thorough interception. Experimental results show that\nASC-Hook reduces overhead to at least 1/29 of that of existing system call\ninterception tools.

While these models are capable of generating\nhigh-quality and realistic images, the complexity of sequential denoising has\nraised societal concerns regarding high computational demands and energy\nconsumption. In response, various efforts have been made to improve inference\nefficiency. However, most of the existing efforts have taken a fixed approach\nwith neural network simplification or text prompt optimization. Are the quality\nimprovements from all denoising computations equally perceivable to humans? We\nobserved that images from different text prompts may require different\ncomputational efforts given the desired content.

We detected 60 type I X-ray\nbursts in the Insight-HXMT medium energy (ME) data, and 37 were also detected\nwith the low-energy (LE) telescope. By superimposing the Insight-HXMT/LE/ME/HE\nlight curves of 37 bursts with similar profiles and intensities, we measured a\ndeficit of X-rays in the $40-70$ keV energy band.

We estimate the average hydrogen mass fraction\nin the fuel at ignition, as $\\bar{X} =0.342\\pm0.033$, and constrain the burst\nfuel composition as $X_0\\leq0.4$. We found that 14 out of 60 X-ray bursts\nexhibited photospheric expansion, and thus we estimated the distance to the\nsource as $10.0\\pm0.71$ kpc.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable highly accurate atomistic\nsimulations of complex materials at unprecedented scales. Despite their\npromise, training ANN potentials to represent intricate potential energy\nsurfaces (PES) with transferability to diverse chemical environments remains\ncomputationally intensive, especially when atomic force data are incorporated\nto improve PES gradients. Here, we present an efficient ANN potential training\nmethodology that uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate atomic\nforces into ANN training, leading to accurate PES models with fewer additional\nfirst-principles calculations and a reduced computational effort for training.\nOur GPR-ANN approach generates synthetic energy data from force information in\nthe reference dataset, thus augmenting the training datasets and bypassing\ndirect force training. Benchmark tests on hybrid density-functional theory data\nfor ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and Li metal-EC interfaces, relevant for\nlithium metal battery applications, demonstrate that GPR-ANN potentials achieve\naccuracies comparable to fully force-trained ANNs with a significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. Detailed comparisons show that the method improves both\ndata efficiency and scalability for complex interfaces and heterogeneous\nenvironments. This work establishes the GPR-ANN method as a powerful and\nscalable framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning interatomic\npotentials, offering the computational and memory efficiency critical for the\nlarge-scale simulations needed for the simulation of materials interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The promise of unsupervised multi-view-stereo (MVS) is to leverage large\nunlabeled datasets, yet current methods underperform when training on difficult\ndata, such as handheld smartphone videos of indoor scenes. Meanwhile,\nhigh-quality synthetic datasets are available but MVS networks trained on these\ndatasets fail to generalize to real-world examples. To bridge this gap, we\npropose a semi-supervised learning framework that allows us to train on real\nand rendered images jointly, capturing structural priors from synthetic data\nwhile ensuring parity with the real-world domain. Central to our framework is a\nnovel set of losses that leverages powerful existing monocular relative-depth\nestimators trained on the synthetic dataset, transferring the rich structure of\nthis relative depth to the MVS predictions on unlabeled data. Inspired by\nperceptual image metrics, we compare the MVS and monocular predictions via a\ndeep feature loss and a multi-scale statistical loss. Our full framework, which\nwe call Prism, achieves large quantitative and qualitative improvements over\ncurrent unsupervised and synthetic-supervised MVS networks. This is a\nbest-case-scenario result, opening the door to using both unlabeled smartphone\nvideos and photorealistic synthetic datasets for training MVS networks.",

    "abstract": "It is a common practice in modern medicine to prescribe multiple medications\nsimultaneously to treat diseases. However, these medications could have adverse\nreactions between them, known as Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI), which have the\npotential to cause significant bodily injury and could even be fatal. Hence, it\nis essential to identify all the DDI events before prescribing multiple drugs\nto a patient. Most contemporary research for predicting DDI events relies on\neither information from Biomedical Knowledge graphs (KG) or drug SMILES, with\nvery few managing to merge data from both to make predictions. While others use\nheuristic algorithms to extract features from SMILES and KGs, which are then\nfed into a Deep Learning framework to generate output. In this study, we\npropose a KG-integrated Transformer architecture to generate an end-to-end\nfully automated Machine Learning pipeline for predicting DDI events with high\naccuracy. The algorithm takes full-scale molecular SMILES sequences of a pair\nof drugs and a biomedical KG as input and predicts the interaction between the\ntwo drugs with high precision. The results show superior performance in two\ndifferent benchmark datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art models\nespecially when the test and training sets contain distinct sets of drug\nmolecules. This demonstrates the strong generalization of the proposed model,\nindicating its potential for DDI event prediction for newly developed drugs.\nThe model does not depend on heuristic models for generating embeddings and has\na minimal number of hyperparameters, making it easy to use while demonstrating\noutstanding performance in low-data scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness, the ability of a model to withstand manipulated\ninputs that cause errors, is essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models in real-world applications. However, previous studies\nhave shown that enhancing adversarial robustness through adversarial training\nincreases vulnerability to privacy attacks. While differential privacy can\nmitigate these attacks, it often compromises robustness against both natural\nand adversarial samples. Our analysis reveals that differential privacy\ndisproportionately impacts low-risk samples, causing an unintended performance\ndrop. To address this, we propose DeMem, which selectively targets high-risk\nsamples, achieving a better balance between privacy protection and model\nrobustness. DeMem is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into various\nadversarial training techniques. Extensive evaluations across multiple training\nmethods and datasets demonstrate that DeMem significantly reduces privacy\nleakage while maintaining robustness against both natural and adversarial\nsamples. These results confirm DeMem's effectiveness and broad applicability in\nenhancing privacy without compromising robustness.",

While\nexisting approaches attempt to solve this problem, we highlight its continuing\nimpact on leading MBRL methods -- including DreamerV3 and DreamerPro -- with a\nnovel environment where background distractions are intricate, predictable, and\nuseless for planning future actions.
