    "abstract": "The synchronic and diachronic study of the evolution of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) unveils one prominent fact that its effect can be traced in\nalmost all fields such as healthcare industry. The growth is perceived\nholistically in software, hardware implementation, or application in these\nvarious fields. As the title suggests, the review will highlight the impact of\nAI on healthcare possibly in all dimensions including precision medicine,\ndiagnostics, drug development, automation of the process, etc., explicating\nwhether AI is a blessing or a curse or both. With the availability of enough\ndata and analysis to examine the topic at hand, however, its application is\nstill functioning in quite early stages in many fields, the present work will\nendeavour to provide an answer to the question. This paper takes a close look\nat how AI is transforming areas such as diagnostics, precision medicine, and\ndrug discovery, while also addressing some of the key ethical challenges it\nbrings. Issues like patient privacy, safety, and the fairness of AI decisions\nare explored to understand whether AI in healthcare is a positive force, a\npotential risk, or perhaps both.",

However, their practical realization\ntypically requires multiple rotations in the complex space due to the adoption\nof random unitaries. Here, we introduce two simplified randomized measurements\nthat limit rotations in a subspace of the complex space. The first is\n\\textit{real randomized measurements} (RRMs) with orthogonal evolution and real\nlocal observables. The second is \\textit{partial real randomized measurements}\n(PRRMs) with orthogonal evolution and imaginary local observables. We show that\nthese measurement protocols exhibit different abilities in capturing\ncorrelations of bipartite systems. We explore various applications of RRMs and\nPRRMs in different quantum information tasks such as characterizing\nhigh-dimensional entanglement, quantum imaginarity, and predicting properties\nof quantum states with classical shadow.",

    "abstract": "Conventional economic and socio-behavioural models assume perfect symmetric\naccess to information and rational behaviour among interacting agents in a\nsocial system. However, real-world events and observations appear to contradict\nsuch assumptions, leading to the possibility of other, more complex interaction\nrules existing between such agents. We investigate this possibility by creating\ntwo different models for a doctor-patient system. One retains the established\nassumptions, while the other incorporates principles of reflexivity theory and\ncognitive social structures. In addition, we utilize a microbial genetic\nalgorithm to optimize the behaviour of the physician and patient agents in both\nmodels. The differences in results for the two models suggest that social\nsystems may not always exhibit the behaviour or even accomplish the purpose for\nwhich they were designed and that modelling the social and cognitive influences\nin a social system may capture various ways a social agent balances\ncomplementary and competing information signals in making choices.",

One might run controlled experiments and measure the corresponding\napplication-facing performance, but such experiments become progressively\ninfeasible at a large scale, and simulations risk yielding inaccurate or\nincomplete results. Instead, we show that we can predict application-facing\nperformance through more easily measured network metrics. For example, network\ntelemetry metrics (e.g., link utilization) can predict application-facing\nmetrics (e.g., transfer latency). Through large-scale measurements of\nproduction networks, we study the correlation between the two types of metrics,\nand construct predictive, interpretable models that serve as a suggestive\nguideline to network designers and operators. We show that no single network\nmetric is universally the best predictor (even though some prior work has\nfocused on a single predictor).

The $\\Lambda$CDM model provides a\ngood simultaneous fit to the combined Planck, ACT, and SPT data, and thus\npasses a powerful test. Combining these CMB datasets with BAO observations, we\nfind that the effective number of neutrino species, spatial curvature, and\nprimordial helium fraction are consistent with standard model values, and that\nthe 95% confidence upper limit on the neutrino mass sum is 0.075 eV. The SPT\ndata are consistent with the somewhat weak preference for excess lensing power\nseen in Planck and ACT data relative to predictions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nWe also detect at greater than 3$\\sigma$ the influence of non-linear evolution\nin the CMB lensing power spectrum and discuss it in the context of the $S_8$\ntension.(abridged)",

    "abstract": "Modern vehicles have evolved from mechanical systems to complex and connected\nones controlled by numerous digital computers interconnected through internal\nnetworks. While this development has improved their efficiency and safety, it\nalso brings new potential risks, particularly cyber-attacks. Several studies\nhave explored the security of vehicle dynamics against such threats. Among\nthese dynamics, the vehicle's lateral dynamics are crucial for maintaining\nstability and control during turns and maneuvers, making them a key focus of\nresearch. However, only a few recent studies have specifically investigated the\nsecurity of lateral dynamics. This paper explores the potential for zero\ndynamics attacks on the vehicle's lateral dynamics, where the attacker can\nremain undetected by leaving no trace on the system's outputs. Three scenarios\nare studied: when the output includes yaw rate, lateral acceleration, and their\ncombination. These two critical measurements of a vehicle's lateral motion are\naccessible through the inertial measurement units (IMU) in every vehicle. For\neach scenario, the impact of zero dynamics attacks on system performance is\nanalyzed and illustrated through simulations. Finally, the paper provides\nrecommendations for securing vehicles' lateral dynamics against such attacks.",

However, the\ntask-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational\ncosts related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging\nto use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This\nhinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful\ncomputational resources and vast amount of training data.

Towards this goal, we propose a modular\ndiffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the\nperformance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and\ngenerative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively\nsmall module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest.\nMoreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling\nstrategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function\nevaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be\ncombined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM.

    "abstract": "This paper examines potential biases and inconsistencies in emotional\nevocation of images produced by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models\nand their potential bias toward negative emotions. In particular, we assess\nthis bias by comparing the emotions evoked by an AI-produced image to the\nemotions evoked by prompts used to create those images. As a first step, the\nstudy evaluates three approaches for identifying emotions in images --\ntraditional supervised learning, zero-shot learning with vision-language\nmodels, and cross-modal auto-captioning -- using EmoSet, a large dataset of\nimage-emotion annotations that categorizes images across eight emotional types.\nResults show fine-tuned models, particularly Google's Vision Transformer (ViT),\nsignificantly outperform zero-shot and caption-based methods in recognizing\nemotions in images. For a cross-modality comparison, we then analyze the\ndifferences between emotions in text prompts -- via existing text-based\nemotion-recognition models -- and the emotions evoked in the resulting images.\nFindings indicate that AI-generated images frequently lean toward negative\nemotional content, regardless of the original prompt. This emotional skew in\ngenerative models could amplify negative affective content in digital spaces,\nperpetuating its prevalence and impact. The study advocates for a\nmultidisciplinary approach to better align AI emotion recognition with\npsychological insights and address potential biases in generative AI outputs\nacross digital media.",

KG_RAG uses knowledge graphs constructed using a small\nmodel that is fine-tuned using knowledge distillation using a large teacher\nmodel.

While the\nimportance of temporal alignment varies across different contexts, achieving\nprecise temporal synchronization is a prominent goal in musical performances.\nMusicians often incorporate expressive timing variations, which require precise\ncontrol over timing and synchronization, particularly in ensemble performance.\nThis is crucial because both deliberate expressive nuances and accidental\ntiming deviations can affect the overall timing of a performance. This\ndiscussion prompts the question of how musicians adjust their temporal dynamics\nto achieve synchronization within an ensemble. This paper introduces a novel\nfeedback correction model based on the Kalman Filter, aimed at improving the\nunderstanding of interpersonal timing in ensemble music performances.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks and have shown promising results in other\ndomains such as protein sequence generation. However, there remain salient\ndifferences between LLMs used for NLP, which effectively handle multiple tasks\nand are available in small sizes, and protein language models that are often\nspecialized for specific tasks and only exist in larger sizes. In this work, we\nintroduce two small protein language models, based on Llama-3-8B and\nPhi-3-mini, that are capable of both uncontrollable and controllable protein\ngeneration. For the uncontrollable generation task, our best model achieves an\naverage pLDDT score of 69.75, demonstrating robust performance in generating\nviable protein structures. For the controllable generation task, in which the\nmodel generates proteins according to properties specified in the prompt, we\nachieve a remarkable average TM-Score of 0.84, indicating high structural\nsimilarity to target proteins. We chose 10 properties, including six classes of\nenzymes, to extend the capabilities of prior protein language models. Our\napproach utilizes the Low-Rank Adaptor (LoRA) technique, reducing trainable\nparameters to just 4% of the original model size, lowering computational\nrequirements. By using a subset of the UniRef50 dataset and small models, we\nreduced the overall training time by 70% without compromising performance.\nNotably, Phi-3-mini reduced trainable parameters by 60%, decreasing training\ncost by 30% compared to Llama 3. Consequently, Phi-3 achieved a comparable\nTM-Score of 0.81, demonstrating that smaller models can match the performance\nof larger ones, like Llama 3.

We examine the direct effects of\ngenerative AI on productivity, the mediating role of productivity in the\nrelationship between generative AI and brand building, and the moderating\ninfluence of cross-border e-commerce strategies by developing and testing a\ncomprehensive model. Based on data collected from 210 manufacturing firms in\nChinese Tianjin, the results show that generative AI significantly increases\nproductivity, which positively affects branding. Moreover, cross-border\ne-commerce strategies were found to moderate the impact of generative AI on\nbranding, underscoring the importance of these strategies for using AI\ntechnologies to compete successfully in the global marketplace. This study\nprovides valuable theory, empiricism and practical contributions to\nunderstanding the role AI plays in manufacturing and electronic commerce.\nBesides, this study tests several hypotheses to quantify these impacts using a\nstructured model that consists of independent, dependent, mediating and\nmoderating variables.

This variable work schedules allows employees to commute\noutside of traditional rush hours. Moreover, many studies showed that commuters\nmight be skeptical of using trains, buses, and carpools and could turn to\npersonal vehicles to get to work, which might increase congestion and crashes\nin the roads.

    "abstract": "Seismic data inevitably suffers from random noise and missing traces in field\nacquisition. This limits the utilization of seismic data for subsequent imaging\nor inversion applications. Recently, dictionary learning has gained remarkable\nsuccess in seismic data denoising and interpolation. Variants of the\npatch-based learning technique, such as the K-SVD algorithm, have been shown to\nimprove denoising and interpolation performance compared to the analytic\ntransform-based methods. However, patch-based learning algorithms work on\noverlapping patches of data and do not take the full data into account during\nreconstruction. By contrast, the data patches (CSC) model treats signals\nglobally and, therefore, has shown superior performance over patch-based\nmethods in several image processing applications. In consequence, we test the\nuse of CSC model for seismic data denoising and interpolation. In particular,\nwe use the local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm to reconstruct\nmissing traces and clean seismic data from noisy input. The denoising and\ninterpolation performance of the LoBCoD algorithm has been compared with that\nof K-SVD and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms using synthetic and\nfield data examples. We use three quality measures to test the denoising\naccuracy: the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the relative L2-norm of the\nerror (RLNE), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). We find that LoBCoD\nperforms better than K-SVD and OMP for all test cases in improving PSNR and\nSSIM, and in reducing RLNE. These observations suggest a huge potential of the\nCSC model in seismic data denoising and interpolation applications.",

These models are applied to residential buildings in Los\nAngeles, and we compare the energy benefits of heat mitigation strategies to\nthe impacts of climate change. We find that cooling demand is likely to\nincrease substantially through midcentury, but engineered high-albedo surfaces\ncould lessen this increase by more than 50%.

The\nresulting multifractal spectra are however strongly left-side asymmetric which\nindicates that this multifractality comes primarily from large fluctuations and\nsmall ones are more of the uncorrelated noise type. What is particularly\ninteresting here is the fact that multifractality is more developed for time\nseries representing transaction volumes than rates of return.

By analysing\ndifferent parts of the X-ray absorption spectra for each element, one can\nobtain information on its chemical state from the X-ray absorption near-edge\nstructure (XANES) and its local environment, distortions, and lattice dynamics\nfrom the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).

Algebraic circuit\ncomplexity theory -- the study of algebraic expressions as circuit models -- is\na natural framework to study the complexity of algorithmic computation.\nAlgebraic circuit complexity enables the study of generalization by defining\nbenchmarks in terms of the computational requirements to solve a problem.\nMoreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical objects; an arbitrarily\nlarge number of samples can be generated for a specified circuit, making it an\nideal experimental sandbox for the data-hungry models that are used today.

This study\nfocuses on image classification tasks, comparing AL methods on CIFAR10,\nCIFAR100, Food101, and the Chest X-ray datasets under varying label noise\nrates. We investigate the impact of model architecture by comparing\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel deep active learning algorithm, GCI-ViTAL,\ndesigned to be robust to label noise. GCI-ViTAL utilizes prediction entropy and\nthe Frobenius norm of last-layer attention vectors compared to class-centric\nclean set attention vectors. Our method identifies samples that are both\nuncertain and semantically divergent from typical images in their assigned\nclass. This allows GCI-ViTAL to select informative data points even in the\npresence of label noise while flagging potentially mislabeled candidates. Label\nsmoothing is applied to train a model that is not overly confident about\npotentially noisy labels. We evaluate GCI-ViTAL under varying levels of\nsymmetric label noise and compare it to five other AL strategies. Our results\ndemonstrate that using ViTs leads to significant performance improvements over\nCNNs across all AL strategies, particularly in noisy label settings. We also\nfind that using the semantic information of images as label grounding helps in\ntraining a more robust model under label noise.

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), remain the most\nregularly-used approach for implementing Bayesian inference. However, the\ncomputational cost of these approaches usually scales worse than linearly with\nthe dimension of the parameter space, limiting their use for models with a\nlarge number of parameters. However, it is not uncommon for models to have\nidentifiability problems. In this case, the likelihood is not informative about\nsome subspaces of the parameter space, and hence the model effectively has a\ndimension that is lower than the number of parameters. Constantine et al.\n(2016) and Schuster et al. (2017) introduced the concept of directly using a\nMetropolis-Hastings (MH) MCMC on the subspaces of the parameter space that are\ninformed by the likelihood as a means to reduce the dimension of the parameter\nspace that needs to be explored. The same paper introduces an approach for\nidentifying such a subspace in the case where it is a linear transformation of\nthe parameter space: this subspace is known as the active subspace. This paper\nintroduces sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods that make use of an active\nsubspace. As well as an SMC counterpart to MH approach of Schuster et al.\n(2017), we introduce an approach to learn the active subspace adaptively, and\nan SMC$^{2}$ approach that is more robust to the linearity assumptions made\nwhen using active subspaces.",

    "abstract": "Current vision models typically maintain a fixed correspondence between their\nrepresentation structure and image space. Each layer comprises a set of tokens\narranged \"on-the-grid,\" which biases patches or tokens to encode information at\na specific spatio(-temporal) location. In this work we present Moving\nOff-the-Grid (MooG), a self-supervised video representation model that offers\nan alternative approach, allowing tokens to move \"off-the-grid\" to better\nenable them to represent scene elements consistently, even as they move across\nthe image plane through time. By using a combination of cross-attention and\npositional embeddings we disentangle the representation structure and image\nstructure. We find that a simple self-supervised objective--next frame\nprediction--trained on video data, results in a set of latent tokens which bind\nto specific scene structures and track them as they move. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of MooG's learned representation both qualitatively and\nquantitatively by training readouts on top of the learned representation on a\nvariety of downstream tasks. We show that MooG can provide a strong foundation\nfor different vision tasks when compared to \"on-the-grid\" baselines.",

The\nseparation lines and recirculation zones are shown on the wing and on the wall\njunction as Re and angle of incidence, ($\\alpha$) are varied. There is good\nagreement on the lowest Re case which has also been computed in direct\nnumerical simulation.

The geometry of the NACA 65(1)-412 section,\nused here, promotes a substantial chord length for the development of the\nrecirculating regions behind separation making it apt for their study.

Most machine learning models for survival analysis\nare black-box models, limiting their use in healthcare settings where\ninterpretability is paramount.

Still, several gaps remain, as no prior\nglass-box survival model can produce calibrated shape functions with enough\nflexibility to capture the complex patterns often found in real data. To fill\nthis gap, we introduce a new glass-box machine learning model for survival\nanalysis called DNAMite. DNAMite uses feature discretization and kernel\nsmoothing in its embedding module, making it possible to learn shape functions\nwith a flexible balance of smoothness and jaggedness. Further, DNAMite produces\ncalibrated shape functions that can be directly interpreted as contributions to\nthe cumulative incidence function.

A challenge to the practical operation\nand scale-up of silicon quantum-photonic integrated circuits, however, is the\nneed to control their extreme sensitivity to process and temperature\nvariations, free-carrier and self-heating nonlinearities, and thermal\ncrosstalk. To date these challenges have been partially addressed using bulky\noff-chip electronics, sacrificing many benefits of a chip-scale platform. Here,\nwe demonstrate the first electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip (EPQSoC)\nconsisting of quantum-correlated photon-pair sources stabilized via on-chip\nfeedback control circuits, all fabricated in a high-volume 45nm CMOS\nmicroelectronics foundry. We use non-invasive photocurrent sensing in a tunable\nmicroring cavity photon-pair source to actively lock it to a fixed pump laser\nwhile operating in the quantum regime, enabling large scale microring-based\nquantum systems. In this first demonstration of such a capability, we achieve a\nhigh CAR of 134 with an ultra-low g(2)(0) of 0.021 at 2.2 kHz off-chip detected\npair rate and 3.3 MHz/mW2 on-chip pair generation efficiency, and over 100 kHz\noff-chip detected pair rate at higher pump powers (1.5 MHz on-chip). These\nsources maintain stable quantum properties in the presence of temperature\nvariations, operating reliably in practical settings with many adjacent devices\ncreating thermal disturbances on the same chip. Such dense electronic-photonic\nintegration enables implementation and control of quantum-photonic systems at\nthe scale required for useful quantum information processing with\nCMOS-fabricated chips.",

We applied two flux density cuts at $0.18$ and\n$0.4$mJy on the radio galaxies observed at 944MHz and considered two source\ndetection algorithms. We found the auto-correlation measurements from the two\nalgorithms at the 0.18mJy cut to deviate for $\\ell\\gtrsim250$ due to the\ndifferent criteria assumed on the source detection and decided to ignore data\nabove this scale. We report a cross-correlation detection of EMU PS1 with CMB\nlensing at $\\sim$5.5$\\sigma$, irrespective of flux density cut. In our\ntheoretical modelling we considered two redshift distribution simulation models\nthat yield consistent results, a linear and a non-linear matter power spectrum,\nand two linear galaxy bias models. That is a constant redshift-independent\ngalaxy bias $b(z)=b_g$ and a constant amplitude galaxy bias $b(z)=b_g/D(z)$. By\nfixing a cosmology model and considering a non-linear matter power spectrum, we\nmeasured a constant galaxy bias at $0.18$mJy ($0.4$mJy) with\n$b_g=2.32^{+0.41}_{-0.33}$ ($2.18^{+0.17}_{-0.25}$) and a constant amplitude\nbias with $b_g=1.72^{+0.31}_{-0.21}$ ($1.78^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$). When $\\sigma_8$\nis a free parameter for the same models at $0.18$mJy ($0.4$mJy) with the\nconstant model we found $\\sigma_8=0.68^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ ($0.82\\pm0.10$), while\nwith the constant amplitude model we measured $\\sigma_8=0.61^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$\n($0.78^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$), respectively.

The former induces central gas inflow due\nto gravitational and hydrodynamic torques, triggering active central star\nformation which quickly depletes the gas of the galaxy. Counter-rotating gas\naccretion overall has a similar outcome but more exclusively through\nhydrodynamic collisions between the pre-existing and newly-accreted gas.

Upon increasing the temperature, stripes and the\nsuperconducting state give way to the enigmatic strange-metal and pseudogap\nregimes, whose precise nature remains a long-standing puzzle. Using modern\ntensor network techniques, we discover a crucial aspect of these regimes.\nInfinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) simulations in the fully\ntwo-dimensional limit reveal a maximum in the charge susceptibility at\ntemperatures above the stripe order. This maximum is located around filling\n$n=0.9$ and intensifies upon cooling. Using minimally entangled typical thermal\nstates (METTS) on finite cylinders, we attribute the enhanced charge\nsusceptibility to the formation of charge clusters, reminiscent of phase\nseparation where the system is partitioned into hole-rich and hole-depleted\nregions. In contrast to genuine phase separation, the charge cluster sizes\nfluctuate without a divergent charge susceptibility. Hence, while this\nprecursor state features clustering of charge carriers, true phase separation\nis ultimately forestalled at lower temperatures by the onset of stripe order.",

    "abstract": "The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with\ngeneric unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with\ncomplex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction.\nInformation loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a\nferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this\nwork, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can\nundergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix\ncontraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law\nentanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in\nwhich the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We\nnumerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both\nsingle- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that\ncontains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential\nferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the\nparamagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the\nX-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a\nferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable,\nthe encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical\nsimulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the\nisometric tensor network representation of the surface code.",

As a first step, we train a\nbackup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states\nusing model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other\ntasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a\ncollision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is\nconsidered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space\nensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We\nanalyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a\ncollision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally\nexpensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a\ndata-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is\nsignificantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For\nevaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while\nkeeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a\nhuman-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered\npermanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our\napproach can generate safe trajectories in real time.",

We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes\nempathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance\nin responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and\nemotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation\nof the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus\nimpacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high\ntheoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes\nhigh-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have\nlittle-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family,\nmore manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the\nempathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and\nfree generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we\nwere unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic\nunderstanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the\nresults are promising because the models showed significant alterations their\nreasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the\nprompts.

The forecasting method for the motions, accelerations, and forces\nacting on the floating system is developed using Hankel-DMD, a methodological\nextension that includes time-delayed copies of the states in an augmented state\nvector. The system identification task is performed by applying Hankel-DMD with\ncontrol (Hankel-DMDc), which models the system including the effect of forcing\nterms. The influence of the main hyperparameters of the methods, namely the\nnumber of delayed copies in the state and input vector and the length of the\nobservation time, is investigated with a full factorial analysis using three\nerror metrics analyzing complementary aspects of the prediction: the normalized\nroot mean square error, the normalized average minimum-maximum absolute error,\nand the Jensen-Shannon divergence. A Bayesian extension of the Hankel-DMD and\nHankel-DMDc is introduced by considering the hyperparameters as stochastic\nvariables varying in suitable ranges defined after the full factorial analysis,\nenriching the predictions with uncertainty quantification.

We apply our\nsketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning\nframework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation.\nAdditionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient\napproach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the\nnormalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic\nresonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve\nsignificant computational acceleration over standard EI counterpart in\nsingle-input setting and network adaptation at test time.",

By letting the growth rate diffusivity be directly\nproportional to the supersaturation, a closed form solution can be found for\nthe case of a separable distribution function of crystal sizes. This result\nrequires that the ratio of the solute diffusion coefficient to the growth rate\ndiffusivity coefficient, be restricted to odd integer values. This implies that\nwhen growth rate dispersion is present, varying the conditions of the solution\ncan only lead to one or more equilibrium size distributions out of an infinite\ndiscrete set of possible size distribution functions. We deal with this\nrestriction by letting the growth rate diffusivity coefficient be restricted to\na spectrum of discrete values. Results are compared with experimental data for\ntwo cases of lactose crystal growth from solution, and one for sucrose, where\nit was suggested that there are two distinct types of kinetic behavior in the\ngrowing crystal ensemble; one of slow growing crystals and the other fast\ngrowing.

These structures can have a major impact on\nthe stability of plasma discharges, with detrimental effects on the operation\nand performance of plasma technologies. Kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) methods\noffer a sufficient level of fidelity to capture these processes and behaviors.\nHowever, three-dimensional PIC simulations that can cost-effectively overcome\nthe curse of dimensionality and enable full-scale simulations of real-world\ntime significance have remained elusive.

    "abstract": "Fiber tractography is a cornerstone of neuroimaging, enabling the detailed\nmapping of the brain's white matter pathways through diffusion MRI. This is\ncrucial for understanding brain connectivity and function, making it a valuable\ntool in neurological applications. Despite its importance, tractography faces\nchallenges due to its complexity and susceptibility to false positives,\nmisrepresenting vital pathways. To address these issues, recent strategies have\nshifted towards deep learning, utilizing supervised learning, which depends on\nprecise ground truth, or reinforcement learning, which operates without it. In\nthis work, we propose Tract-RLFormer, a network utilizing both supervised and\nreinforcement learning, in a two-stage policy refinement process that markedly\nimproves the accuracy and generalizability across various data-sets. By\nemploying a tract-specific approach, our network directly delineates the tracts\nof interest, bypassing the traditional segmentation process. Through rigorous\nvalidation on datasets such as TractoInferno, HCP, and ISMRM-2015, our\nmethodology demonstrates a leap forward in tractography, showcasing its ability\nto accurately map the brain's white matter tracts.",

    "abstract": "In combustion theory, flames are usually described in terms of the dynamics\nof iso-surfaces of a specific scalar. The flame displacement speed is then\nintroduced as a local variable quantifying the progression of these\niso-surfaces relative to the flow field. While formally defined as a scalar,\nthe physical meaning of this quantity allows relating it with a vector pointing\nalong the normal direction of the scalar iso-surface. In this work, this\none-dimensional concept is extended by the introduction of a generalized flame\ndisplacement velocity vector, which is associated with the dynamics of\niso-surfaces of two generic scalars, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. It is then shown how\na new flamelet paradigm can be built around this velocity vector, which leads\nto a very compact and generic set of two-dimensional flamelet equations for\nthermochemical quantities and the conditioning scalar gradients, $g_{\\alpha} =\n\\lvert \\nabla \\alpha \\rvert$ and $g_{\\beta} = \\lvert \\nabla \\beta \\rvert$. The\nmost important features of the developed framework are discussed in the context\nof partially-premixed flames, which provides significant insights into several\naspects of the theory, including the nature of the different contributions to\nthe flamelet equations for the conditioning scalar gradients and the fact that\ndifferent flamelet coordinate systems (orthogonal and non-orthogonal) can be\ncharacterized by the same flame displacement velocity vector. This approach\nopens an entire spectrum of possibilities for the definition of new\ntwo-dimensional composition spaces, which represents a very promising basis for\nthe development of new variants of flamelet theory.",

However, their effectiveness relies\nheavily on large amounts of labeled data, which are often time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive to generate manually. To overcome this challenge, it is\nessential to develop strategies that reduce reliance on extensive labeled data\nwhile preserving model performance. In this paper, we propose FisherMask, a\nFisher information-based active learning (AL) approach that identifies key\nnetwork parameters by masking them based on their Fisher information values.\nFisherMask enhances batch AL by using Fisher information to select the most\ncritical parameters, allowing the identification of the most impactful samples\nduring AL training.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FisherMask\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets,\nincluding CIFAR-10 and FashionMNIST, especially under imbalanced settings.\nThese improvements lead to substantial gains in labeling efficiency.

The acceleration of the PIC method has thus become a topic of high\ninterest, with several approaches having been pursued to this end. Among these,\nthe concept of reduced-order (RO) PIC simulations, first introduced in 2023,\nprovides a uniquely flexible and computationally efficient framework for\nkinetic plasma modelling - characteristics verified extensively in various\nplasma configurations. In this two-part article, we report the latest progress\nachieved on RO-PIC.

We discuss these refinements in comparison against the\noriginal formulation, illustrating the progression to a \"first-order\"\nimplementation from the baseline \"zeroth-order\" one.

Traditional\nmethods, like quantum state tomography (QST), necessitate a full reconstruction\nof the density matrix for a given system and demand resources that scale\nexponentially with system size. We propose an alternative strategy that reduces\nthe required information by combining multicopy measurements with artificial\nneural networks (ANNs), resulting in a 67\\% reduction in measurement\nrequirements compared to QST. We have successfully measured two-qubit quantum\ncorrelations of Bell states subjected to a depolarizing channel (resulting in\nWerner states) and an amplitude damping channel (leading to Horodecki states)\nusing the multicopy approach on real quantum hardware. Our experiments,\nconducted with transmon qubits on IBMQ processors, quantified the violation of\nBell's inequality and the negativity of two-qubit entangled states. We compared\nthese results with those obtained from the standard QST approach and applied a\nmaximum likelihood method to mitigate noise. We trained ANNs to estimate\nentanglement and nonlocality measures using optimized sets of projections\nidentified through Shapley's (SHAP) analysis for the Werner and Horodecki\nstates. The ANN output, based on this reduced set of projections, aligns well\nwith expected values and enhances noise robustness.

Reconstructing a good feature space is essential to\naugment the AI power of data, improve model generalization, and increase the\navailability of downstream ML models. Existing literature, such as feature\ntransformation and feature selection, is labor-intensive (e.g., heavy reliance\non empirical experience) and mostly designed for tabular data.

At the core of StdGEN is our proposed Semantic-aware Large\nReconstruction Model (S-LRM), a transformer-based generalizable model that\njointly reconstructs geometry, color and semantics from multi-view images in a\nfeed-forward manner. A differentiable multi-layer semantic surface extraction\nscheme is introduced to acquire meshes from hybrid implicit fields\nreconstructed by our S-LRM. Additionally, a specialized efficient multi-view\ndiffusion model and an iterative multi-layer surface refinement module are\nintegrated into the pipeline to facilitate high-quality, decomposable 3D\ncharacter generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art\nperformance in 3D anime character generation, surpassing existing baselines by\na significant margin in geometry, texture and decomposability.

Prior work has proposed a diverse\nset of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting\nregression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions\nthroughout training. Surprisingly, we find that no existing method consistently\noutperforms a simple stratified sampling baseline in terms of average test\nperplexity. To understand this inconsistency, we unify existing methods into a\nstandard framework, showing they are equivalent to solving a common\noptimization problem: minimize average loss subject to a method-specific mixing\nlaw -- an implicit assumption on the relationship between loss and mixture\nproportions. This framework suggests that measuring the fidelity of a method's\nmixing law can offer insights into its performance. Empirically, we find that\nexisting methods set their mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in the\ninconsistent mixing performance we observe. Using this insight, we derive a new\nonline method named Aioli, which directly estimates the mixing law parameters\nthroughout training and uses them to dynamically adjust proportions. Aioli\noutperforms stratified sampling on 6 out of 6 datasets by an average of 0.27\ntest perplexity points, whereas existing methods fail to consistently beat\nstratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points worse. Moreover, in a practical\nsetting where proportions are learned on shorter runs due to computational\nconstraints, Aioli can dynamically adjust these proportions over the full\ntraining run, consistently improving performance over existing methods by up to\n12.012 test perplexity points.",

Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for\ncolor representation often struggle to effectively capture anisotropic\ncomponents, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex\nlighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color\nsaturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a\nperceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes,\nincluding opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical\nharmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which\nenables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects.

    "abstract": "We report on the emergence of a highly non-classical collective behavior in\nquantum parametric oscillators, which we name quantum hyperspin, induced by a\ntailored nonlinear interaction. This is the second quantized version of\nclassical multidimensional spherical spins, as XY spins in two dimensions, and\nHeisenberg spins in three dimensions. In the phase space, the quantum\nhyperspins are represented as spherical shells whose radius scales with the\nnumber of particles in a way such that it cannot be factorized even in the\nlimit of large particle number. We show that the nonlinearly coupled quantum\noscillators form a high-dimensional entangled state that is surprisingly robust\nwith respect to the coupling with the environment. Such a behavior results from\na properly engineered reservoir. Networks of entangled quantum hyperspins are a\nnew approach to quantum simulations for applications in computing, Ising\nmachines, and high-energy physics models. We analyze from first principles\nthrough ab initio numerical simulations the properties of quantum hyperspins,\nincluding the interplay of entanglement and coupling frustration.",

    "abstract": "Extraction of hot carriers (HCs) over the band-edge is a key to harvest solar\nenergy beyond Shockley-Queisser limit1. Graphene is known as a HC-layered\nmaterial due to phonon bottleneck effect near Dirac point, but limited by low\nphotocarrier density2. Graphene/transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)\nheterostructures circumvent this issue by ultrafast carrier transfer from TMD\nto graphene2,3. Nevertheless, efficient extraction of photocurrent by means of\nHCs together with carrier multiplication (CM) is still missing. Here, we\nintroduce an ultrathin broadband resonant tunneling (BRT) barrier, TiOX to\nefficiently extract photocurrent with simultaneous CM and HC measurements in\nMoS2/graphene/TiOX heterostructure. The BRT layer gives rise to boosting open\ncircuit voltage which is linearly proportional to incident photon energy.\nMeanwhile, short circuit current rises rapidly over 2Eg with obvious CM\nfeature. This was explained by defining the joint density of states between\ngraphene and TiOX layer over positive and negative voltage. The broadband\nresonant tunneling states inherently constructed from oxidation states varying\nfrom Ti3+ to Ti4+ allow the ultrafast HCs to efficiently transfer from graphene\nto TiOX layer. We find that the number of available tunneling states is\ndirectly proportional to short circuit current, which is well corroborated with\nTiOX and MoS2 thickness variance. We obtained an optimum thickness of BRT layer\nof ~2.8 nm, yielding cascade open circuit voltage as high as ~0.7 V, two orders\nof magnitude higher than that without BRT layer to reach a record efficiency of\n5.3% with improved fill factor owing to synergistic HC and CM conversion under\n1-SUN with long-term stability.",

This transition actually occurs through an intermediate\nnear-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an\nordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a\nparadigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by\ncarrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature\nestablished. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in\nultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network\nof coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers.\nDetailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but\nrather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of\npreviously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the\nparent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic\nmodulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order\nparameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and\nrelative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example\nof an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.",

Additionally, wash traders\nexploit periods of heightened media attention and online rumors to amplify\ntheir influence, causing rapid but short-lived spikes in legitimate trading\nvolume.

    "abstract": "We extend graphic statics to describe the forces and moments in 3D\nrigid-jointed frame structures. Graphic statics relates the form diagram (the\ngeometrical layout of structural bars) to a reciprocal force diagram\nrepresenting the forces in those bars. For 3D structures, Rankine reciprocals\nrepresent bar forces by areas of polygons perpendicular to bars. Unfortunately,\nthat description is incomplete. Here, Rankine reciprocals are generalised to\nprovide a complete description. Not only can any state of axial self-stress be\ndescribed, but so can any state of self-stress involving axial and shear forces\ncoexistent with bending and torsional moments. This is achieved using a\ndiscrete version of Maxwell's Diagram of Stress which maps the body space\ncontaining the structure into the stress space containing the force diagram.\nThis mapping is a Legendre transform, defined via a stress function and its\ngradients. The description resulting here is applicable to any state of\nself-stress in any 3D bar structure whose joints may have any degree of fixity.\nUsing homology theory, a structural frame is decomposed into a set of loops,\nwith states of self-stress being represented by dual loops in the stress space.\nLoops need not be plane. At any point on the structure the six components of\nstress resultant (axial and two shear force components, with torsional and two\nbending moment components) are represented by the oriented areas of the dual\nloops projected onto the six basis bivector planes in the 4D stress space. This\ndescription is complete: any self-stress of any frame can be represented.\nFinally, this paper describes an object whose projections encode internal\nmoments. It is a hybrid of form and force: it plots the original stress\nfunction at the dual coordinates. This allows internal bending and torsional\nmoments to be separated from the moments about the origin associated with the\nforces.",

This is frequently demonstrated through an\nphenomenon known as the McGurk Effect, during which a listener is presented\nwith incongruent auditory and visual speech that fuse together into the percept\nof an illusory intermediate phoneme. Building on a recent framework that\nproposes how to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural\nnetworks, we evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on\naudiovisual speech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words\ndesigned to elicit the McGurk effect. We compared networks trained on clean\nspeech to those trained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with\nnoisy speech led to an increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses\nacross all models. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the\nlevel of auditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of\naudiovisual integration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this\nintegration failed to develop. These results suggest that excessive noise\nexposure during critical periods of audiovisual learning may negatively\ninfluence the development of audiovisual speech integration.

To that end, we introduce a Universal Spectral\nRepresentation (USR) that leverages sensor meta-data, such as sensing kernel\nspecifications and sensing wavelengths, to encode spectra obtained from any\nspectral instrument into a common representation, such that a single model can\ningest data from any sensor. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for\npre-training such models in a self-supervised manner using a novel random\nsensor-augmentation and reconstruction pipeline to learn spectral features\nindependent of the sensing paradigm. We demonstrate that our architecture can\nlearn sensor independent spectral features that generalize effectively to\nsensors not seen during training.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a\nsignificant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing\nhigh-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on\nsubword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can\nvary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level,\nreflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the\nsequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the\nliterature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability\nfor researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary\nsequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental\nframeworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories,\nincluding pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the\nrepresentation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between\nautoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a\nmultifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision,\nincluding image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal\ngeneration. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains,\nincluding emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about\n250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to\nautoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research\ndirections.

While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling model\nsize, dataset size, and compute resources improve task performance, the impact\nof scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore\nscaling laws for modeling the primate VVS by systematically evaluating over 600\nmodels trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4,\nIT and COR behaviors. We observe that while behavioral alignment continues to\nscale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains\ntrue across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with\nstronger inductive bias and datasets with higher-quality images are more\ncompute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level\nvisual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor\nalignment. Finally, we develop a scaling recipe, indicating that a greater\nproportion of compute should be allocated to data samples over model size. Our\nresults suggest that while scaling alone might suffice for alignment with human\ncore object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the\nbrain's visual ventral stream with current architectures and datasets,\nhighlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain-like models.",

Existing automated metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and CIDEr\nattempt to fill this gap, but they often exhibit weak correlations with human\njudgment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evaluation framework\ncalled Image2Text2Image, which leverages diffusion models, such as Stable\nDiffusion or DALL-E, for text-to-image generation. In the Image2Text2Image\nframework, an input image is first processed by a selected image captioning\nmodel, chosen for evaluation, to generate a textual description. Using this\ngenerated description, a diffusion model then creates a new image. By comparing\nfeatures extracted from the original and generated images, we measure their\nsimilarity using a designated similarity metric. A high similarity score\nsuggests that the model has produced a faithful textual description, while a\nlow score highlights discrepancies, revealing potential weaknesses in the\nmodel's performance. Notably, our framework does not rely on human-annotated\nreference captions, making it a valuable tool for assessing image captioning\nmodels.

A widely adopted deployment scenario of 5G FWA includes\nedge cloud that supports computing services and Radio Access Network (RAN)\nfunctions. Such edge cloud requires network and energy resources for 5G FWA.\nThis paper proposes renewable energy powered and Open RAN-based architecture\nfor 5G FWA serving LDRAs using three-level closed-loops. Open RAN is a new 5G\nRAN architecture allowing Open Central Unit and Open Distributed Unit to be\ndistributed in virtualized environment. The first closed-loop distributes radio\nresources to Open RAN instances and slices at the edge cloud. The second\nclosed-loop allocates radio resources to houses. We design a new energy model\nthat leverages renewable energy. We jointly optimize radio and energy resource\nallocation in closed-loop 3. We formulate ultra-small and small-time scale\noptimization problems that link closed-loops to maximize communication utility\nwhile minimizing energy costs. We propose reinforcement learning and successive\nconvex approximation to solve the formulated problems. Then, we use solution\ndata and continual learning to improve resource allocation on a large\ntimescale. Our proposal satisfies 97.14% slice delay budget.",

State-of-the-art\nsaliency methods generate local explanations that highlight the area in the\ninput image where a class is identified but cannot explain how a concept of\ninterest contributes to the prediction, which is essential for bias mitigation.\nOn the other hand, concept-based methods, such as TCAV (Testing with Concept\nActivation Vectors), provide insights into how sensitive is the network to a\nconcept, but cannot compute its attribution in a specific prediction nor show\nits location within the input image.

The results indicate that higher angles of attack lead to a less\nintense feedback loop, resulting in lower tonal noise frequencies and reduced\nnoise amplitude. The maximum noise reduction observed is over 14dB when\ncomparing 14{\\deg} to 3{\\deg}. Furthermore, an improved formula is proposed to\nenhance the prediction of slat noise tonal frequencies and to better elucidate\nthe mechanism behind tonal noise generation.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems, such as economic, social, biological, and ecological\nsystems, usually feature interactions not only between pairwise entities but\nalso among three or more entities. These multi-entity interactions are known as\nhigher-order interactions. Hypergraph, as a mathematical tool, can effectively\ncharacterize higher-order interactions, where nodes denote entities and\nhyperedges represent interactions among multiple entities. Meanwhile, all\nhigher-order interactions can also be projected into a number of lower-order\ninteractions or even some pairwise interactions. Whether it is necessary to\nconsider all higher-order interactions, and whether it is with little loss to\nreplace them by lower-order or even pairwise interactions, remain a\ncontroversial issue. If the role of higher-order interactions is insignificant,\nthe complexity of computation and the difficulty of analysis can be drastically\nreduced by projecting higher-order interactions into lower-order or pairwise\ninteractions. We use link prediction, a fundamental problem in network science,\nas the entry point. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of higher-order\ninteractions on link predictive accuracy to explore the necessity of these\nstructures. We propose a method to decompose the higher-order structures in a\nstepwise way, thereby allowing to systematically explore the impacts of\nstructures at different orders on link prediction. The results indicate that in\nsome networks, incorporating higher-order interactions significantly enhances\nthe accuracy of link prediction, while in others, the effect is insignificant.\nTherefore, we think that the role of higher-order interactions varies in\ndifferent types of networks. Overall, since the improvement in predictive\naccuracy provided by higher-order interactions is significant in some networks,\nwe believe that the study of higher-order interactions is both necessary and\nvaluable.",

    "abstract": "When observing the surface patterns of objects delimited by smooth surfaces,\nthe projections of the surface patterns to the image domain will be subject to\nsubstantial variabilities, as induced by variabilities in the geometric viewing\nconditions, and as generated by either monocular or binocular imaging\nconditions, or by relative motions between the object and the observer over\ntime. To first order of approximation, the image deformations of such projected\nsurface patterns can be modelled as local linearizations in terms of local 2-D\nspatial affine transformations.\n  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of relationships between the\ndegrees of freedom in 2-D spatial affine image transformations and the degrees\nof freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields.\nFor this purpose, we first describe a canonical decomposition of 2-D affine\ntransformations on a product form, closely related to a singular value\ndecomposition, while in closed form, and which reveals the degrees of freedom\nin terms of (i) uniform scaling transformations, (ii) an overall amount of\nglobal rotation, (iii) a complementary non-uniform scaling transformation and\n(iv) a relative normalization to a preferred symmetry orientation in the image\ndomain. Then, we show how these degrees of freedom relate to the degrees of\nfreedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model.\n  Finally, we use these theoretical results to consider whether we could regard\nthe biological receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals\nas being able to span the degrees of freedom of 2-D spatial affine\ntransformations, based on interpretations of existing neurophysiological\nexperimental results.",

    "abstract": "We develop generalized Petersson/Bruggeman/Kuznetsov (PBK) formulas for\nspecified local components at non-archimedean places. In fact, we introduce two\nhypotheses on non-archimedean test function pairs $f \\leftrightarrow \\pi(f)$,\ncalled geometric and spectral hypotheses, under which one obtains `nice' PBK\nformulas by the adelic relative trace function approach. Then, given a\nsupercuspidal representation $\\sigma$ of ${\\rm PGL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$, we study\nextensively the case that $\\pi(f)$ is a projection onto the line of the newform\nif $\\pi$ is isomorphc to $\\sigma$ or its unramified quadratic twist, and\n$\\pi(f) = 0$ otherwise. As a first application, we prove an optimal large sieve\ninequality for families of automorphic representations that arise in our\nframework.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the\nmonitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear\nobservable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point\ncorrelation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as\ndiagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement\nproperties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum\ntrajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it\nis possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the\nunitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation\npatterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.",

    "abstract": "A novel quantum control protocol utilizing two-photon processes with\ntrigonometric pulse modulation is developed, enabling the intermediate state\npopulation's dynamic elimination (DE). The proposed DE technique excels at\nsingle-photon resonance in contrast to the well-known adiabatic elimination\n(AE) regime, which requires large single-photon detuning and strong pulses. The\nDE approach outperforms AE in efficiency and exhibits enhanced resilience to\none-photon detuning since the key control parameter, the effective two-photon\nRabi frequency, inversely proportional to the modulation frequency, does not\ndepend on the one-photon detuning. The comprehensive analysis of population\ntransfer and Ramsey interferometry demonstrates the protocol's superiority,\nachieving enhanced signal-to-noise ratios and higher fidelities with respect to\nexisting two-photon methods.",

We design an energy model that\nintegrates radio resource allocation and formulate ultra-small and\nsmall-timescale optimizations for the PT to maximize slice requirement\nsatisfaction while minimizing energy costs.

While the\nAnti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is one of the\nmost celebrated examples, the field of fractonic matter -- driven in part by\ngapless phases resembling linearized gravity -- has also seen rapid\ndevelopments. Despite the deep implications of both areas, connections between\nthem remain sparse, primarily due to the difficulty in constructing explicit\nmodels that encapsulate both fields' essential features.

Using explicit numerical and analytical calculations\non the discrete hyperbolic lattice, we show that the boundary state exhibits\nconformal field theory properties. Our main result is that bulk defects induce\nan emergent temperature for the boundary state, proportional to the defect\nperimeter, in quantitative agreement with the expected behaviour of a black\nhole in AdS spacetime. The Hyperbolic Fracton Model thus emerges as a unique\nlattice model of holographic principle equipped with a well-defined bulk\nHamiltonian, and offers a promising gateway for studying a wide range of\nholographic phenomena.",

The\nparameter space is defined by a criticality parameter \\( \\xi \\), which controls\nthe emergence of baroclinic instability, and the ratio of layer depths \\(\n\\delta \\), which describes the surface intensification of stratification.\nEastward jets detaching from the western boundary are observed when \\( \\delta\n\\ll 1 \\) and \\( \\xi \\sim 1 \\), representing a regime transition from a\nvortex-dominated western boundary current to a zonostrophic regime\ncharacterized by multiple eastward jets. Remarkably, these surface-intensified\npatterns emerge without considering bottom friction. The emergence of the\ncoherent eastward jet is further addressed with complementary 1.5-layer\nsimulations and explained through both linear stability analysis and turbulence\nphenomenology.

Because\nreflection and diffraction of sound by the human body cause subtle acoustic\nsignal changes compared to sound obstruction, the existing model degrades its\naccuracy significantly when subjects deviate from this line, limiting its\npracticality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nnovel method composed of a position discriminator and reverberation-resistant\nmodel. The former predicts the standing positions of subjects and applies\nadversarial learning to extract subject position-invariant features. The latter\nutilizes acoustic signals before the estimation target time as references to\nenhance robustness against the variations in sound arrival times due to\ndiffraction and reflection. We construct an acoustic pose estimation dataset\nthat covers diverse human locations and demonstrate through experiments that\nour proposed method outperforms existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Bayes' rule naturally allows for inference refinement in a streaming fashion,\nwithout the need to recompute posteriors from scratch whenever new data\narrives. In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our\nprior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when\nprocessing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i)\napproximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating\nresults appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state\nspaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its\nscalability and the tractability of variational posteriors. For discrete state\nspaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable\napproximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings. To enable streaming\nBayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, we propose streaming Bayes\nGFlowNets (abbreviated as SB-GFlowNets) by leveraging the recently proposed\nGFlowNets -- a powerful class of amortized samplers for discrete compositional\nobjects. Notably, SB-GFlowNet approximates the initial posterior using a\nstandard GFlowNet and subsequently updates it using a tailored procedure that\nrequires only the newly observed data. Our case studies in linear preference\nlearning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets\nin sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting. As expected,\nwe also observe that SB-GFlowNets is significantly faster than repeatedly\ntraining a GFlowNet from scratch to sample from the full posterior.",

In this study, forty-six participants\ninteracted with a virtual agent whose persona was manipulated as extravert or\nintrovert in three different conversational tasks (small talk, knowledge test,\nconvincing). Social-evaluation, emotional experience, and realism were assessed\nusing ratings. Interactive engagement was measured by quantifying participants'\nwords and conversational turns. Finally, we measured participants' willingness\nto ask the agent for help during the knowledge test. Our findings show that the\nextraverted agent was more positively evaluated, elicited a more pleasant\nexperience and greater engagement, and was assessed as more realistic compared\nto the introverted agent. Whereas persona did not affect the tendency to ask\nfor help, participants were generally more confident in the answer when they\nhad help of the LLM.

Notably, acquiring\nknowledge through weak interactions (e.g., starring) as opposed to strong ones\n(e.g., committing) emerges as a stronger predictor of future novelty.",

    "abstract": "When trains collide with obstacles, the consequences are often severe. To\nassess how artificial intelligence might contribute to avoiding collisions, we\nneed to understand how train drivers do it. What aspects of a situation do they\nconsider when evaluating the risk of collision? In the present study, we\nassumed that train drivers do not only identify potential obstacles but\ninterpret what they see in order to anticipate how the situation might unfold.\nHowever, to date it is unclear how exactly this is accomplished. Therefore, we\nassessed which cues train drivers use and what inferences they make. To this\nend, image-based expert interviews were conducted with 33 train drivers.\nParticipants saw images with potential obstacles, rated the risk of collision,\nand explained their evaluation. Moreover, they were asked how the situation\nwould need to change to decrease or increase collision risk. From their verbal\nreports, we extracted concepts about the potential obstacles, contexts, or\nconsequences, and assigned these concepts to various categories (e.g., people's\nidentity, location, movement, action, physical features, and mental states).\nThe results revealed that especially for people, train drivers reason about\ntheir actions and mental states, and draw relations between concepts to make\nfurther inferences. These inferences systematically differ between situations.\nOur findings emphasise the need to understand train drivers' risk evaluation\nprocesses when aiming to enhance the safety of both human and automatic train\noperation.",

In this work, we further develop this proposal by\nintroducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole\nreflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an\nensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with\nthe LISA space-based interferometer.

While designs of\npolarization-independent structures have reduced the need for polarized\nillumination, they are often limited by either low Q factors or low resonance\nmodulation. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a metasurface with\npolarization-independent quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC), where\nthe unit cell consists of four silicon squares arranged in a two-dimensional\narray and the resonance properties can be controlled by adjusting the edge\nlength difference between different squares.

This work addresses a common limitation in previous designs, which either\nachieved high Q factors exceeding 200 with a resonance modulation of less than\n10%, leading to challenging signal-to-noise ratio requirements, or achieved\nstrong resonance modulation with Q factors of only around 10, limiting light\nconfinement and fine-tuning capabilities. In contrast, our metasurface ensures\nthat the polarization-independent signal is sharp and distinct within the\nsystem, reducing the demands on signal-to-noise ratio and improving robustness.\nExperiments show the consistent performance across different polarization\nangles.

We present a\nrigorous theoretical framework for this adaptive model, including two\nfoundational theorems.

The second theorem provides a precise bound on the energy\ndissipation rate, demonstrating that dissipation remains controlled and\nrealistic even as boundary effects vary spatially. By allowing the dissipation\ncoefficient to decrease near boundary layers, this approach preserves the finer\nturbulent structures without excessive smoothing, yielding a more physically\naccurate representation of the flow.

While 3D models provide acute details, they\nare computationally expensive, especially with fluid-structure interaction\n(FSI) simulations. 1D models offer a computationally efficient alternative, by\nsimplifying the 3D Navier-Stokes equations through axisymmetric flow assumption\nand cross-sectional averaging. However, traditional 1D models based on finite\nelement methods (FEM) often lack accuracy compared to 3D averaged solutions.\nThis study introduces a novel physics-constrained machine learning technique\nthat enhances the accuracy of 1D blood flow models while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. Our approach, utilizing a physics-constrained coupled\nneural differential equation (PCNDE) framework, demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to conventional FEM-based 1D models across a wide range of\ninlet boundary condition waveforms and stenosis blockage ratios. A key\ninnovation lies in the spatial formulation of the momentum conservation\nequation, departing from the traditional temporal approach and capitalizing on\nthe inherent temporal periodicity of blood flow. This spatial neural\ndifferential equation formulation switches space and time and overcomes issues\nrelated to coupling stability and smoothness, while simplifying boundary\ncondition implementation. The model accurately captures flow rate, area, and\npressure variations for unseen waveforms and geometries. We evaluate the\nmodel's robustness to input noise and explore the loss landscapes associated\nwith the inclusion of different physics terms.

    "abstract": "The butterfly diagram of the solar cycle exhibits a poleward migration of the\ndiffuse magnetic field resulting from the decay of trailing sunspots. It is one\ncomponent of what is sometimes referred to as the \"rush to the poles\". We\ninvestigate under which conditions the rush to the poles can be reproduced in\nflux-transport Babcock-Leighton dynamo models. We identify three main ways to\nreproduce it: a flux emergence probability that decreases rapidly with\nlatitude; a threshold in subsurface toroidal field strength between slow and\nfast emergence; and an emergence rate based on magnetic buoyancy. We find that\nall three mechanisms lead to solar-like butterfly diagrams, but which present\nnotable differences between them. The shape of the butterfly diagram is very\nsensitive to model parameters for the threshold prescription, while most models\nincorporating magnetic buoyancy converge to very similar butterfly diagrams,\nwith butterfly wings widths of $\\lesssim\\pm 30^\\circ$, in very good agreement\nwith observations. With turbulent diffusivities above $35~\\text{km}^2/\\text{s}$\nbut below about $40~\\text{km}^2/\\text{s}$, buoyancy models are strikingly\nsolar-like. The threshold and magnetic buoyancy prescriptions make the models\nnon-linear and as such can saturate the dynamo through latitudinal quenching.\nThe period of the models involving buoyancy is independent of the source term\namplitude, but emergence loss increases it by $\\simeq 60\\%$. For the rush to\nthe poles to be visible, a mechanism suppressing (enhancing) emergences at high\n(low) latitudes must operate. It is not sufficient that the toroidal field be\nstored at low latitudes for emergences to be limited to low latitudes. From\nthese models we infer that the Sun is not in the advection-dominated regime,\nbut also not in the diffusion-dominated regime. The cycle period is set through\na balance between advection, diffusion and flux emergence.",

The approach is demonstrated on a sub-critical\nplane Poiseuille flow at Re = 4000, which has been a benchmark problem studied\nin prior investigations on identifying spatially-localized flow structures.\nRemarkably, we find that a subset of the perturbations identified by our method\nyield a comparable degree of energy amplification as their global counterparts.\nWe anticipate our proposed analysis tools will facilitate further\ninvestigations into spatially-localized flow instabilities, including within\nthe resolvent and input-output analysis frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Soft robots pose difficulties in terms of control, requiring novel strategies\nto effectively manipulate their compliant structures. Model-based approaches\nface challenges due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearities such as\nhysteresis effects. In contrast, learning-based approaches provide nonlinear\nmodels of different soft robots based only on measured data. In this paper,\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) predict the behavior of an articulated soft\nrobot (ASR) with five degrees of freedom (DoF). RNNs based on gated recurrent\nunits (GRUs) are compared to the more commonly used long short-term memory\n(LSTM) networks and show better accuracy. The recurrence enables the capture of\nhysteresis effects that are inherent in soft robots due to viscoelasticity or\nfriction but cannot be captured by simple feedforward networks. The data-driven\nmodel is used within a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), whereby the\ncorrect handling of the RNN's hidden states is focused. A training approach is\npresented that allows measured values to be utilized in each control cycle.\nThis enables accurate predictions of short horizons based on sensor data, which\nis crucial for closed-loop NMPC. The proposed learning-based NMPC enables\ntrajectory tracking with an average error of 1.2deg in experiments with the\npneumatic five-DoF ASR.",

Combining previous scaling relations\nwith new analytic calculations, we created a toy model to explore the different\nphysical regimes described by the M-L diagram. Despite its simplicity, our\nmodel accurately reproduces several observational properties reported for\nfilaments and HFS such as their expected typical aspect ratio ($A$), mean\nsurface density ($\\Sigma$), and gas accretion rate ($\\dot{m}$). Moreover, this\nmodel naturally explains the different mass and length regimes populated by\nfilaments and HFS, respectively. Our model predicts a dichotomy between\nfilamentary ($A\\geq 3$) and spheroidal ($A<3$) structures connected to the\nrelative importance of their fragmentation, accretion, and collapse timescales.\nIndividual filaments with low accretion rates are dominated by an efficient\ninternal fragmentation.

For the constant coefficients, through linear stability\nanalysis, we analytically identify three distinct regions for the physically\nsignificant equilibrium point. Further inspection reveals that the system\nexhibits limit-cycle vibrations in one of these regions. Using the harmonic\nbalance method, we determine the properties of the limit cycle, thereby\nunravelling the frequency and amplitude that characterize the periodic\noscillations of the system's variables. For the varying coefficients case, the\nstability is studied using Floquet analysis and Hills determinant method. The\npart of the stability boundary related to parametric resonance has an\nelliptical shape, while the remaining part remains unchanged. One of the major\nfindings is that a linear parametric force, can suppress or amplify the\nparametric resonance induced by another parametric force depending on the\namplitude of the former. In the context of the Hyperloop system, this means\nthat parametric resonance caused by base excitation-in other words by the\nlinearized parametric electromagnetic force can be suppressed by modulating the\ncoefficient of the aeroelastic force in the same frequency. The effectiveness\nis highly dependent on the phase difference between the modulation and the base\nexcitation. The origin of the suppression is attributed to the stabilizing\ncharacter of the parametric aeroelastic force as revealed through energy\nanalysis. We provide analytical expressions for the stability boundaries and\nfor the stability's dependence on the phase shift of the modulation.",

To address\nthese issues, we propose two methods. The first method introduces the Co and\nStructure Event Argument Extraction model (CsEAE) based on Small Language\nModels (SLMs). CsEAE includes a co-occurrences-aware module, which integrates\ninformation about all events present in the current input through context\nlabeling and co-occurrences event prompts extraction. Additionally, CsEAE\nincludes a structure-aware module that reduces interference from redundant\ninformation by establishing structural relationships between the sentence\ncontaining the trigger and other sentences in the document. The second method\nintroduces new prompts to transform the extraction task into a generative task\nsuitable for Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing gaps in EAE performance\nusing LLMs under Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) conditions. We also fine-tuned\nmultiple datasets to develop an LLM that performs better across most datasets.\nFinally, we applied insights from CsEAE to LLMs, achieving further performance\nimprovements.

However, such unusual\n$\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ are typically observed only in compounds containing heavy\nelements, with large unit cells, or at high temperatures, primarily due to\nsignificant anharmonicity. In this study, we utilize chemical bonding\nprinciples to weaken the Ag-Ag bonds within the Ag$_6$ octahedron by\nintroducing a ligand in the bridge position. Additionally, the weak\nAg-chalcogen bonds, arising from fully filled $p$-$d$ antibonding orbitals,\nprovide an avenue to further enhance lattice anharmonicity. We propose the\nincorporation of a chalcogen anion as a bridge ligand to promote phonon\nrattling in Ag$_6$-octahedron-based compounds. Guided by this design strategy,\nwe theoretically identified five Ag$_6$ octahedron-based compounds,\n$A$Ag$_3X_2$ ($A$ = Li, Na, and K; $X$ = S and Se), which are characterized by\nlow average atomic masses and exhibit exceptionally strong four-phonon\nscattering. Consequently, these compounds demonstrate ultralow thermal\nconductivities (0.3 $\\sim$ 0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) with minimal temperature\ndependence (T$^{-0.1}$) across a wide temperature range. Experimental\nvalidation confirmed that the $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ of NaAg$_3$S$_2$ is 0.45\nWm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ within the temperature range of 200 to 550 K. Our results\nclearly demonstrate that weak chemical bonding plays a crucial role in\ndesigning compounds with glass-like $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$, highlighting the\neffectiveness of chemical bonding engineering in achieving desired thermal\ntransport properties.",

However, deeper areas, such as lunar caves and\ncraters, require the mobility of legged robots. To do so, appropriate end\neffectors must be designed to enable climbing and walking on the granular\nsurface of the Moon. This paper investigates the behavior of an underactuated\nsoft gripper on deformable granular material when a legged robot is walking in\nsoft soil. A modular test bench and a simulation model were developed to\nobserve the gripper sinkage behavior under load. The gripper uses tendon-driven\nfingers to match its target shape and grasp on the target surface using\nmultiple micro-spines. The sinkage of the gripper in silica sand was measured\nby comparing the axial displacement of the gripper with the nominal load of the\nrobot mass. Multiple experiments were performed to observe the sinkage of the\ngripper over a range of slope angles. A simulation model accounting for the\ndegrees of compliance of the gripper fingers was created using Altair\nMotionSolve software and coupled to Altair EDEM to compute the gripper\ninteraction with particles utilizing the discrete element method. After\nvalidation of the model, complementary simulations using Lunar gravity and a\nregolith particle model were performed. The results show that a satisfactory\ngripper model with accurate freedom of motion can be created in simulation\nusing the Altair simulation packages and expected sinkage under load in a\nparticle-filled environment can be estimated using this model. By computing the\nsinkage of the end effector of legged robots, the results can be directly\nintegrated into the motion control algorithm and improve the accuracy of\nmobility in a granular material environment.",

The high volume of\ndata, including scientific and telemetry data, makes manual inspection\nchallenging.

Euclid's success depends on accurate monitoring and\ninterpretation of housekeeping telemetry and science-derived data. Thousands of\ntelemetry parameters, monitored as time series, may or may not impact the\nquality of scientific data. These parameters have complex interdependencies,\noften due to physical relationships (e.g., proximity of temperature sensors).\nOptimising science operations requires careful anomaly detection and\nidentification of hidden parameter states. Moreover, understanding the\ninteractions between known anomalies and physical quantities is crucial yet\ncomplex, as related parameters may display anomalies with varied timing and\nintensity.\n  We address these challenges by analysing temperature anomalies in Euclid's\ntelemetry from February to August 2024, focusing on eleven temperature\nparameters and 35 covariates. We use a predictive XGBoost model to forecast\ntemperatures based on historical values, detecting anomalies as deviations from\npredictions. A second XGBoost model predicts anomalies from covariates,\ncapturing their relationships to temperature anomalies. We identify the top\nthree anomalies per parameter and analyse their interactions with covariates\nusing SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), enabling rapid, automated analysis\nof complex parameter relationships.\n  Our method demonstrates how machine learning can enhance telemetry\nmonitoring, offering scalable solutions for other missions with similar data\nchallenges.",

A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis is performed on a\nportion of the turbulent boundary layer, revealing a significant energy spread\nacross higher-order modes. Despite this, TBL streaks are identified, and the\nlocations of the most energetic structures correspond to the peaks in the\nReynolds stresses.",

    "abstract": "We systematically study various network Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithms for the Gaussian mixture model within the framework of decentralized\nfederated learning. Our theoretical investigation reveals that directly\nextending the classical decentralized supervised learning method to the EM\nalgorithm exhibits poor estimation accuracy with heterogeneous data across\nclients and struggles to converge numerically when Gaussian components are\npoorly-separated. To address these issues, we propose two novel solutions.\nFirst, to handle heterogeneous data, we introduce a momentum network EM (MNEM)\nalgorithm, which uses a momentum parameter to combine information from both the\ncurrent and historical estimators. Second, to tackle the challenge of\npoorly-separated Gaussian components, we develop a semi-supervised MNEM\n(semi-MNEM) algorithm, which leverages partially labeled data. Rigorous\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that MNEM can achieve statistical efficiency\ncomparable to that of the whole sample estimator when the mixture components\nsatisfy certain separation conditions, even in heterogeneous scenarios.\nMoreover, the semi-MNEM estimator enhances the convergence speed of the MNEM\nalgorithm, effectively addressing the numerical convergence challenges in\npoorly-separated scenarios. Extensive simulation and real data analyses are\nconducted to justify our theoretical findings.",

At its core, this technique\nrelies on measuring the drop in ionic current through the pore induced by the\npassage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage\nsignal to molecular dimensions. However, there exists no model considering the\nresistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when\nobstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important for low\naspect ratio pores, with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes. In\nthis work, a general method by which to model the resistance of the access\nregions of a pore in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented.\nThin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer\ntheir conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our\nmodel accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and\nfinite-length pores as a function of the distance from the pore in the presence\nof simple obstructions geometries (e.g. cylindrical and spherical objects) or\ncomplex structures (i.e. sequence of simple obstruction sub-units). The model\nis further shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for\nobstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A web-based tool is created\nto predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries\ntranslocating through differently shaped pores. The introduced model will help\nguide experimental designs and thus presents a straightforward way to extend\nthe quantification of the resistive pulse technique at the nanoscale.",

The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates\nat a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized,\nrepulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates\nat a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We\nuse the Advantage Actor-Critic approach to train microagents for their\norigin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this\napproach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static\none) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other\nwords, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently\nwell-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of\nparticle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We\nalso demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed\nto a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting.

    "abstract": "Background: Screening trials require large sample sizes and long\ntime-horizons to demonstrate mortality reductions. We recently proposed\nincreasing statistical power by testing stored control-arm specimens, called\nthe Intended Effect (IE) design. To evaluate feasibility of the IE design, the\nUS National Cancer Institute (NCI) is collecting blood specimens in the\ncontrol-arm of the NCI Vanguard Multicancer Detection pilot feasibility trial.\nHowever, key assumptions of the IE design require more investigation and\nrelaxation. Methods: We relax the IE design to (1) reduce costs by testing only\na stratified sample of control-arm specimens by incorporating\ninverse-probability sampling weights, (2) correct for potential loss-of-signal\nin stored control-arm specimens, and (3) correct for non-compliance with\ncontrol-arm specimen collections. We also examine sensitivity to unintended\neffects of screening. Results: In simulations, testing all primary-outcome\ncontrol-arm specimens and a 50% sample of the rest maintains nearly all the\npower of the IE while only testing half the control-arm specimens. Power\nremains increased from the IE analysis (versus the standard analysis) even if\nunintended effects exist. The IE design is robust to some loss-of-signal\nscenarios, but otherwise requires retest-positive fractions that correct bias\nat a small loss of power. The IE can be biased and lose power under control-arm\nnon-compliance scenarios, but corrections correct bias and can increase power.\nConclusions: The IE design can be made more cost-efficient and robust to\nloss-of-signal. Unintended effects will not typically reduce the power gain\nover the standard trial design. Non-compliance with control-arm specimen\ncollections can cause bias and loss of power that can be mitigated by\ncorrections. Although promising, practical experience with the IE design in\nscreening trials is necessary.",

Electron\nbeams optically modulated into vortices carry orbital angular momentum, thanks\nto which they are sensitive to the spatial phase distribution and topology of\nthe investigated field. The sense of chirality of the studied specimen can be\nextracted from the spectra of the electron beam with nanoscale precision owing\nto the short picometer de Broglie wavelength of the electron beam.

This state-dependent potential\nintroduces nonlinearity into the state evolution, of which the theory is named\nSchroedinger-Newton (SN) theory. The formalism for understanding the continuous\nquantum measurement process on the quantum state in the context of\nsemiclassical gravity theory has been previously discussed using the\nSchr\\\"odinger picture in Paper I [1]. In this work, an equivalent formalism\nusing the Heisenberg picture is developed and applied to the analysis of two\noptomechanical experiment protocols that targeted testing the quantum nature of\ngravity. This Heisenberg picture formalism of the SN theory has the advantage\nof helping the investigation of the covariance matrices of the outgoing light\nfields in these protocols and further the entanglement features. We found that\nthe classical gravity between the quantum trajectories of two mirrors under\ncontinuous quantum measurement in the SN theory can induce an apparent\nentanglement of the outgoing light field (though there is no quantum\nentanglement of the mirrors), which could serve as a false alarm for those\nexperiments designed for probing the quantum gravity induced entanglement.",

However, existing generative retrieval\nmethods directly decode docid when a query is given, making it impossible to\nprovide users with explanations as an answer for \"Why this document is\nretrieved?\". To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category\nPath-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by\ngenerating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE\nleverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to\nspecific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for\nthe same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between\nthe query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting\nthe document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE\nconstructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy,\nleverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and\noptimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During\ninference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse\ntopic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in\nthe final ranked list of docids. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHyPE not only offers a high level of explainability but also improves the\nretrieval performance in the document retrieval task.",

    "abstract": "Wigner-positive quantum states have the peculiarity to admit a Wigner\nfunction that is a genuine probability distribution over phase space. The\nShannon differential entropy of the Wigner function of such states - called\nWigner entropy for brevity - emerges as a fundamental information-theoretic\nmeasure in phase space and is subject to a conjectured lower bound, reflecting\nthe uncertainty principle. In this work, we prove that this Wigner entropy\nconjecture holds true for a broad class of Wigner-positive states known as\nbeam-splitter states, which are obtained by evolving a separable state through\na balanced beam splitter and then discarding one mode. Our proof relies on\nknown bounds on the $p$-norms of cross-Wigner functions and on the interference\nformula, which relates the convolution of Wigner functions to the squared\nmodulus of a cross-Wigner function. Originally discussed in the context of\nsignal analysis, the interference formula is not commonly used in quantum\noptics although it unveils a strong symmetry exhibited by Wigner functions of\npure states. We provide here a simple proof of the formula and highlight some\nof its implications. Finally, we prove an extended conjecture on the\nWigner-R\\'enyi entropy of beam-splitter states, albeit in a restricted range\nfor the R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$.",

Representational similarity is\ngenerally measured for individual datasets and is not necessarily consistent\nacross datasets. Thus, one may wonder whether this convergence of model\nrepresentations is confounded by the datasets commonly used in machine\nlearning. Here, we propose a systematic way to measure how representational\nsimilarity between models varies with the set of stimuli used to construct the\nrepresentations. We find that the objective function is a crucial factor in\ndetermining the consistency of representational similarities across datasets.\nSpecifically, self-supervised vision models learn representations whose\nrelative pairwise similarities generalize better from one dataset to another\ncompared to those of image classification or image-text models. Moreover, the\ncorrespondence between representational similarities and the models' task\nbehavior is dataset-dependent, being most strongly pronounced for single-domain\ndatasets.

We give a spectral characterization of\npeak state transfer that allows us to fully characterize peak state transfer in\nthe arc-reversal (Grover) walk on various families of graphs, including\nstrongly regular graphs and incidence graphs of block designs (assuming that\nthe walk starts at a point of the design). In addition, we provide many\nexamples of peak state transfer, including an infinite family where the amount\nof peak state transfer tends to $1$ as the number of vertices grows. We further\ndemonstrate that peak state transfer properties extend to infinite families of\ngraphs generated by vertex blow-ups, and we characterize periodicity in the\nvertex-face walk on toroidal grids. In our analysis, we make extensive use of\nthe spectral decomposition of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the\ntransition matrix down onto a subspace.

While this has\nincreased productivity, there are still frequent instances of incorrect codes\nbeing provided.

This study proposes a task for evaluating\nanswerability, which assesses whether valid answers can be generated based on\nusers' queries and retrieved APIs in RaCG. Additionally, we build a benchmark\ndataset called Retrieval-augmented Code Generability Evaluation (RaCGEval) to\nevaluate the performance of models performing this task. Experimental results\nshow that this task remains at a very challenging level, with baseline models\nexhibiting a low performance of 46.7%.

To address these challenges, we first devise a data-free\nknowledge distillation strategy to tackle relevant concepts forgetting. Unlike\nexisting methods that rely on additional real data or offline replay of\noriginal concept data, our approach enables on-the-fly knowledge distillation\nto retain the previous concepts while learning new ones, without accessing any\nprevious data.

Agents adopting this option aim to address a problem to the extent\nnecessary to remove negative impact on themselves, although they do not free\nride on cooperation effort provided by others. This property of the individual\nsolution is similar to that of option defection in the stag hunt. Thus, the\nrole of the interplay of defection in the snowdrift game and individual\nsolution was examined in this study. The well-mixed population has two\nasymptotically stable rest points, one wherein the individual solution occupies\nthe population, and the other wherein cooperation and defection coexist. The\ninteractions on a square lattice enlarge the parameter region wherein\ncooperation survives, and the three strategies often coexist. The\nscrutinization of the evolutionary process shows that multiple mechanisms lead\nto the coexistence of the three strategies depending on parameter values.

These vulnerabilities can lead to\nsubstantial economic losses across various industries. Manual vulnerability\nrepair is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. To address the\nchallenges of vulnerability repair, researchers have proposed various\nsolutions, with learning-based automatic vulnerability repair techniques\ngaining widespread attention. However, existing methods often focus on learning\nmore vulnerability data to improve repair outcomes, while neglecting the\ndiverse characteristics of vulnerable code, and suffer from imprecise\nvulnerability localization.To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nCRepair, a CVAE-based automatic vulnerability repair technology aimed at fixing\nsecurity vulnerabilities in system code. We first preprocess the vulnerability\ndata using a prompt-based method to serve as input to the model. Then, we apply\ncausal inference techniques to map the vulnerability feature data to\nprobability distributions. By employing multi-sample feature fusion, we capture\ndiverse vulnerability feature information. Finally, conditional control is used\nto guide the model in repairing the vulnerabilities.Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other benchmark\nmodels, achieving a perfect repair rate of 52%.

V2X systems require diverse\nQuality of Service (QoS) provisions, with V2V communication demanding stricter\nlatency and reliability compared to V2I. The 5G New Radio-V2X (NR-V2X) standard\naddresses these needs using multi-numerology Orthogonal Frequency Division\nMultiple Access (OFDMA), which allows for flexible allocation of radio\nresources. However, V2I and V2V users sharing the same radio resources leads to\ninterference, necessitating efficient power and resource allocation. In this\nwork, we propose a novel resource allocation and sharing algorithm for 5G-based\nV2X systems. Our approach first groups Resource Blocks (RBs) into Resource\nChunks (RCs) and allocates them to V2I users using the Gale-Shapley stable\nmatching algorithm. Power is then allocated to RCs to facilitate efficient\nresource sharing between V2I and V2V users through a bisection search method.\nFinally, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to pair V2I and V2V users,\nmaintaining low computational complexity while ensuring high performance.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our proposed Gale-Shapley Resource\nAllocation with Gale-Shapley Sharing (GSRAGS) achieves competitive performance\nwith lower complexity compared to existing works while effectively meeting the\nQoS demands of V2X communication systems.",

Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions of a\nfibril-rich area are performed using spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca\nII 854.2 nm line obtained with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter and\nspectroscopic observations in the Ca II H line obtained with the CHROMospheric\nImaging Spectrometer (CHROMIS) at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST).\nAdditionally, coobservations in the Mg II h & k lines obtained with the\nInterface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) are used in the inversions to\nbetter constrain the thermodynamic properties of the fibrils. The incorporation\nof multiple atomic species and spectral lines proves to better constrain the\nproperties of the plasma constituting the fibrils. In particular, the tracing\nof a large number of fibrils allowed for the study of the variation of the\ntemperature and magnetic field along their projected length over the field of\nview.

The magnetic field\nis also reported to be larger at the footpoints, being almost twice as large as\nthe minimum value reported at the middle point of the fibrils.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel coded integrated passive sensing and communication\n(CIPSAC) system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where a\nmulti-antenna base station (BS) passively senses the parameters of the targets\nand decodes the information bit sequences transmitted by a user. The\ntransmitted signal is comprised of pilot and data OFDM symbols where the data\nsymbols adopt cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-assisted channel codes to\nfacilitate both the decoding and sensing procedures. In the proposed scheme,\nCRC not only enhances the reliability of communication but also provides\nguidance to the parameter sensing procedure at the BS. In particular, a novel\niterative parameter sensing and channel decoding (IPSCD) algorithm is proposed,\nwhere the correctly decoded codewords that pass CRC are utilized for sensing to\nimprove the parameter estimation accuracy, and in return, more accurate\nparameter estimates lead to a larger number of correctly decoded data symbols.\nConventional sensing algorithms rely only on the received pilot signals, while\nwe utilize both the data and pilot signals for sensing. We provide a detailed\nanalysis of the optimal strategy, in which the wrongly decoded data packets are\nreplaced by zero codewords. To further improve the performance, we introduce\nlearning-based near-orthogonal superposition (NOS) codes, which exhibit\nsuperior error correction capability especially in the short block length\nregime. NOS codes are trained using a weighted loss function, where a hyper\nparameter is introduced to balance the sensing and the communication losses.\nSimulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed CIPSAC system and the\nIPSCD algorithm, where both the sensing and decoding performances are\nsignificantly improved with a few iterations. We also carry out extensive\nablation studies for a comprehensive understanding of the proposed scheme.",

Starting from the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations,\nsimplifying assumptions were applied based on physical properties and symmetry\nconsiderations of the energetic-particle-driven geodesic acoustic mode (EGAM)\nto reduce complexity. Our approach embeds physical laws directly into the\nneural network architecture by exposing latent differential states, enabling\nthe model to capture complex features in the nonlinear saturated stage that are\ndifficult to describe analytically, and thus, the new artificial neural network\nis named as ExpNODE (Exposed latent state Neural ODE). ExpNODE was evaluated\nusing a data set generated from first-principles simulations of the EGAM\ninstability, focusing on the pre-saturated stage and the nonlinear saturated\nstage where the mode properties are most complex. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmodels such as ConvLSTM, ExpNODE with physical information not only achieved\nlower test loss but also converged faster during training. Specifically, it\noutperformed ConvLSTM method in both the 20-step and 40-step prediction\nhorizons, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the\nmodel exhibited strong generalization capabilities, accurately predicting mode\nprofiles outside the training data set. Visual comparisons between model\npredictions and ground truth data showed that ExpNODE with physical information\nclosely captured detailed features and asymmetries inherent in the EGAM\ndynamics that were not adequately captured by other models.

While advancements in sonar and camera technology with\ndeep learning aid the obstacle detection and path planning to a great extent,\nachieving the right balance between computational resources , precision and\nsafety maintained remains a challenge. Finding optimal solutions for real-time\nnavigation in cluttered environments becomes pivotal as systems have to process\nlarge amounts of data efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel obstacle\navoidance method for navigating 3D underwater environments. This approach\nutilizes a standard multibeam forward-looking sonar to detect and map obstacle\nin 3D environment. Instead of using computationally expensive 3D sensors, we\npivot the 2D sonar to get 3D heuristic data effectively transforming the sensor\ninto a 2.5D sonar for real-time 3D navigation decisions. This approach enhances\nobstacle detection and navigation by leveraging the simplicity of 2D sonar with\nthe depth perception typically associated with 3D systems. We have further\nincorporated Control Barrier Function (CBF) as a filter to ensure safety of the\nAUV. The effectiveness of this algorithm was tested on a six degrees of freedom\n(DOF) rover in various simulation scenarios. The results demonstrate that the\nsystem successfully avoids obstacles and navigates toward predefined goals,\nshowcasing its capability to manage complex underwater environments with\nprecision.

We apply the recently-developed\nmethod called extended-MOLA inversions to infer localised estimates of internal\nrotation rates of synthetic observations of red giants. We search for suitable\nreference stellar models following a grid-based approach, and assess the\nrobustness of the resulting inferences to the choice of reference model.

We find\nthat the effect of a near surface perturbation in the synthetic observations on\nthe rotation rates estimated based on the correlation between the observed\nrotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter is negligible. We\nconclude that when using an ensemble of reference models, constructed based on\nmatching the mixed mode pattern, the input rotation rates can be recovered\nacross a range of fundamental stellar parameters like mass, mixing-length\nparameter and composition.

    "abstract": "Recent advances have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) excel as\nlistwise rerankers, but their high computational demands remain a barrier to\nwidespread adoption. Further, the traditional language modeling (LM) objective\nis not ideally suited for reranking tasks. FIRST is a novel approach that\naddresses these challenges by integrating a learning-to-rank objective and\nleveraging the logits of only the first generated token, thereby significantly\nreducing inference latency compared to traditional LLM rerankers. In this\nstudy, we extend the evaluation of FIRST to the TREC Deep Learning datasets\n(DL19-22), validating its robustness across diverse domains. We investigate the\ninfluence of different first-stage retrievers on FIRST rerankers, observing\ndiminishing returns and patterns consistent with traditional LLM rerankers.\nThrough applying the FIRST objective to a broader range of backbone models, we\nachieve effectiveness surpassing the original implementation. Our experiments\nconfirm that fast reranking with single-token logits does not compromise\nout-of-domain reranking quality. To better quantify the computational savings\nin the original study, we measure and compare latency to find a 21%-42% gain\nacross various models and benchmarks. Moreover, while LM training implicitly\nimproves zero-shot single-token reranking, our experiments also raise questions\nabout whether LM pre-training may hinder subsequent fine-tuning with the FIRST\nobjective. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective\nlistwise reranking in future applications.",

    "abstract": "Metallenes are atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials lacking a\nlayered structure in the bulk form. They can be stabilized by nanoscale\nconstrictions like pores in 2D covalent templates, but the isotropic metallic\nbonding makes stabilization difficult. A few metallenes have been stabilized\nbut comparison with theory predictions has not always been clear. Here, we use\ndensity-functional theory calculations to explore the energetics and dynamic\nstabilities of $45$ metallenes at six lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal,\nand their buckled counterparts) and varying atomic densities. We found that of\nthe $270$ different crystalline lattices, 128 were dynamically stable at\nsporadic densities, mostly under tensile strain. At the energy minima, lattices\nwere often dynamically unstable against amorphization and the breaking down of\nmetallene planarity. Consequently, the results imply that crystalline\nmetallenes should be seen through a novel paradigm: they should be considered\nnot as membranes with fixed structures and lattice constants but as yielding\nmembranes that can be stabilized better under tensile strain and low atomic\ndensity. Following this paradigm, we rank the most promising metallenes for 2D\nstability and hope that the paradigm will help develop new strategies to\nsynthesize larger and more stable metallene samples for plasmonic, optical, and\ncatalytic applications.",

In unstructured gradual pruning, which sparsifies a network by\ngradually removing individual network parameters until a targeted network\nsparsity is reached, recent works show that both gradient and weight magnitudes\nshould be considered. In this work, we show that such mechanism, e.g., the\norder of prioritization and selection criteria, is essential. We introduce a\ngradient-first magnitude-next strategy for choosing the parameters to prune,\nand show that a fixed-rate subselection criterion between these steps works\nbetter, in contrast to the annealing approach in the literature.

Here we numerically explore subcritical convective dynamo action in a\nspherical shell, using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems\ntheory to uncover the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic field generation. Through\nnonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal\nseed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo\nsolution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable\nand unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining\nthese two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are\nrevealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the\ngeodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark\nof Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more\nextreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches\na nonlinear dynamo solution by first approaching an unstable travelling wave\nsolution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a\nmagnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost\nfunctional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can\nsystematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior\nknowledge of its structure.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications\n(NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the\nbase station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received\nsignal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician\nfading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a\nmaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional\nuncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both\nalgorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the\nalgorithmic side, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms for\nsolving the MLE problem: an exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm and an\ninexact CD algorithm. The exact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional\noptimization subproblem exactly using matrix eigenvalue decomposition and\npolynomial root-finding. By approximating the objective function appropriately,\nthe inexact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem\ninexactly with lower complexity and more robust numerical performance.\nAdditionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under\ncorrelated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The\nanalysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the\nsignature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under\ncorrelated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels.\nConversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under\nuncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and verify\nthe correctness of the analysis.",

Identifying the key\ninstigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but\nremains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA\n(Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground\nForums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a\ntextual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model\n(LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors.\nThese extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to\nmodel user structural relationships, significantly improving identification\naccuracy.

As empirical datasets most often present\ncomplex features and interplays between structure and temporal evolution,\ncreating surrogate data is however a challenging task, in particular for data\ndescribing time-resolved interactions between agents. Here we propose a method\nto generate surrogate temporal networks that mimic such observed datasets. The\nmethod is based on a decomposition of the original dataset into small temporal\nsubnetworks encoding local structures on a short time scale. These are used as\nbuilding blocks to generate a new synthetic temporal network that will hence\ninherit the shape of local interactions from the dataset. Moreover, we also\ntake into account larger scale correlations on structural and temporal\ndimension, using them to inform the process of assembling the building blocks.\nWe showcase the method by generating surrogate networks for several datasets of\nsocial interactions and comparing them to the original data on two\ncomplementary aspects. First, we show that the surrogate data possess complex\nstructural and temporal features similar to the ones of the original data.\nSecond, we simulate several dynamical processes, describing respectively\nepidemic spread, opinion formation and emergence of norms in a population, and\ncompare the outcome of these processes on the generated and original datasets.\nWe describe the method in detail and provide an implementation so that it can\nbe easily used in future works based on temporally evolving networks.",

However, existing approaches using LLMs face limitations in\ngrounding their outputs within the physical environment and aligning with the\ncapabilities of the robot. This challenge becomes even more pronounced with\nsmaller language models, which are more computationally efficient but less\nrobust in task planning and execution. In this paper, we present a novel\nmodular architecture designed to enhance the robustness of LLM-driven robotics\nby addressing these grounding and alignment issues.

Our architecture introduces an ``expected outcomes''\nmodule to prevent mischaracterization of subgoals and a feedback mechanism to\nenable real-time error recovery. Experimental results, both in simulation and\non physical robots, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task\nsuccess rates for pick-and-place and manipulation tasks compared to both larger\nLLMs and standard baselines.

In contrast to existing IQT\nmethods which adopt supervised learning frameworks, in this work, we propose\ntwo novel formulations of the IQT problem. The first approach uses an\nunsupervised learning framework, whereas the second is a combination of both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning. The unsupervised learning approach\nconsiders a sparse representation (SRep) and dictionary learning model, which\nwe call IQT-SRep, whereas the combination of supervised and unsupervised\nlearning approach is based on deep dictionary learning (DDL), which we call\nIQT-DDL. The IQT-SRep approach trains two dictionaries using a SRep model using\npairs of low- and high-quality volumes. Subsequently, the SRep of a low-quality\nblock, in terms of the low-quality dictionary, can be directly used to recover\nthe corresponding high-quality block using the high-quality dictionary. On the\nother hand, the IQT-DDL approach explicitly learns a high-resolution dictionary\nto upscale the input volume, while the entire network, including high\ndictionary generator, is simultaneously optimised to take full advantage of\ndeep learning methods. The two models are evaluated using a low-field magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) application aiming to recover high-quality images akin\nto those obtained from high-field scanners.

We argue that this is due to a\nsemantic gap between humans and DMs, which makes good negative prompts for DMs\nappear unintuitive to humans. To bridge this gap, we propose a new\ndiffusion-negative prompting (DNP) strategy. DNP is based on a new procedure to\nsample images that are least compliant with p under the distribution of the DM,\ndenoted as diffusion-negative sampling (DNS). Given p, one such image is\nsampled, which is then translated into natural language by the user or a\ncaptioning model, to produce the negative prompt n*. The pair (p, n*) is\nfinally used to prompt the DM. DNS is straightforward to implement and requires\nno training.

Therefore, there is a high fundamental interest in unraveling\nthe electronic transport mechanisms at stake in multilayers of the most\nconducting MXene, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$. Although weak localization (WL) has been\nproposed as the dominating low-temperature (LT) transport mechanism in\nTi$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films, there have been few attempts to model it\nquantitatively. In this paper, the role of important structural parameters --\nthickness, interflake coupling, defects -- on the dimensionality of the LT\ntransport mechanisms in spin-coated Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films is investigated\nthrough LT and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. A dimensional\ncrossover from 2D to 3D WL is clearly evidenced when the film thickness exceeds\nthe dephasing length $l_\\phi$, which is in the $50-100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ range. 2D\nWL can be restored by weakening the coupling between adjacent flakes, the\nintrinsic thickness of which is lower than $l_\\phi$, hence acting as parallel\n2D conductors. Alternatively, $l_\\phi$ can be reduced down to the\n$10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ range by defects. Our results clearly emphasize the ability\nof WL quantitative study to give deep insights in the physics of electron\ntransport in MXene thin films.",

Therefore, automatic image denoising using deep learning\nmethods is of high interest. MR images containing line-like structures such as\nroots or vessels yield special characteristics as they display connected\nstructures and yield sparse information. For this kind of data, it is important\nto consider voxel neighborhoods when training a denoising network. In this\npaper, we translate the Perceptual Loss to 3D data by comparing feature maps of\nuntrained networks in the loss function as done previously for 2D data. We\ntested the performance of untrained Perceptual Loss (uPL) on 3D image denoising\nof MR images displaying brain vessels (MR angiograms - MRA) and images of plant\nroots in soil. We investigate the impact of various uPL characteristics such as\nweight initialization, network depth, kernel size, and pooling operations on\nthe results. We tested the performance of the uPL loss on four Rician noise\nlevels using evaluation metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index Metric\n(SSIM). We observe, that our uPL outperforms conventional loss functions such\nas the L1 loss or a loss based on the Structural Similarity Index Metric\n(SSIM). The uPL network's initialization is not important, while network depth\nand pooling operations impact denoising performance. E.g. for both datasets a\nnetwork with five convolutional layers led to the best performance while a\nnetwork with more layers led to a performance drop. We also find that small uPL\nnetworks led to better or comparable results than using large networks such as\nVGG. We observe superior performance of our loss for both datasets, all noise\nlevels, and three network architectures.

Finally, we merge the synthetic\nsamples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the\nWorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain\nWorkflowLlama.

    "abstract": "Carrier landing of aircrafts is a challenge for control due to the existence\nof nonlinear wind disturbances and the requirements of changing reference\ntrajectories. In this paper, a robust landing control system is presented for\ncarrier landing of unmanned F/A-18 aircraft. In the control system, an\naugmented observer is applied to estimate the combined disturbances in the\npitch dynamics of F/A-18 aircraft during carrier landing. Therefore, the\ncontrol performance is improved through the control compensations from these\nestimations. Additionally, the controllers are designed to regulate the\nvelocity, rate of descent and vertical position. A full model, including the\nnonlinear flight dynamics, controller, carrier deck motion, wind and\nmeasurement noise, is constructed numerically and implemented in software.\nCombining the observer with a proportional-derivative (PD) control, the\nproposed pitch control shows the better transient characteristics and stronger\nrobustness than a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The\nsimulations verify that the designed control system can make the aircraft\nquickly track a time-varying reference despite the existence of nonlinear\ndisturbances and noise.",

The presented control system can make the\nquadrotor UAV autonomously land whilst overcoming these adverse conditions, and\nthe addition of a rudder beneath each propeller is designed to increase the yaw\nauthority which is found to be lacking in heavy-lift quadrotor UAV. The PID\nflight control system is proposed based on reference-point tracking, allowing\nthe UAV to follow any desired path in 3D space whilst simultaneously yawing to\nface any desired heading. Realistic saturation limits on actuator outputs to\nensure the real-world performance of actuators. Disturbances include randomised\ngusting wind in 3 axes, and sensor noise on translation and rotation signals to\nrepresent noise from the GPS and accelerometer respectively. The results from\nthe simulations demonstrate that the UAV is capable of landing on a ship which\nis moving with varying heading and oscillating vertically on ocean waves and\nhas the ability to time its descent such that it meets the ship at the peak of\na wave to minimise the relative velocity.",

    "abstract": "The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are prone to thermal instability\n(TI), which can significantly impact the thermal and dynamic evolution of\nplanet-forming regions. Observable as episodic accretion outbursts, such\nperiodic disturbances shape the disk's vertical and radial structure. We\ninvestigate the stability of the inner disk edge around a Class II T Tauri star\nand analyse the consequences of TI on the inner disk's evolution in both the\nvertical and radial dimensions. A particular focus is laid on the emergence and\ndestruction of solid-trapping pressure maxima. Our 2D axisymmetric radiation\nhydrodynamic models include the transition to the dead zone from a highly\nturbulent inner disk, heating by both stellar irradiation and viscous\ndissipation, vertical and radial radiative transport and an adaptive\ndust-to-gas mass ratio. The simulated time frames include both the TI- and\nquiescent phases. We track the TI on S-curves of thermal stability. The TI in\nour models can develop in disks with moderate accretion rates and results from\nthe activation of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dead zone. The\nTI creates an extensive MRI active region around the midplane and disrupts the\nstable pebble- and migration trap at the inner edge of the dead zone. Our\nsimulations consistently show the occurrence of TI-reflares, which, together\nwith the initial TI, produce pressure maxima in the inner disk within 1 AU,\npossibly providing favourable conditions for streaming instability. On a\ntimescale of a few thousand years, TI regularly disrupts the disk's radial and\nvertical structure within 1 AU. While several pressure maxima are created,\nstable migration traps are destroyed and reinstated after the TI phase. Our\nmodels provide a foundation for more detailed investigations into phenomena\nsuch as short-term variability of accretion rates.",

We then propose a\nvisualization system StoryExplorer which combines stroke annotation and\nGPT-based visual hints to quickly extract story fragments and interactively\nconstruct storyline. To evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of\nStoryExplorer, we conducted 2 case studies and in-depth user interviews with 16\ntarget users. The result shows that users can better extract the storyline by\nusing StoryExplorer along with the proposed workflow.",

However, direct experimental validation is\nchallenging due to the rapid phase transition from metastable water. In this\nstudy, we explored whether the phase transition pathways from metastable water\nprovide insight into the thermodynamic origin of these anomalies. Using a\nclassical density functional theory approach with realistic theoretical water\nmodels, we examined how different thermodynamic scenarios influence vapor\nnucleation kinetics at negative pressures. Our findings show significant\nvariations in nucleation kinetics and mechanism during both isobaric and\nisochoric cooling. In the TCP scenario, the nucleation barrier increases\nsteadily during isobaric cooling, with a slight decrease near the Widom line at\nlower temperatures (Ts). In contrast, the SF scenario shows a monotonic\nincrease in the nucleation barrier. For the CPF scenario, we observed a\nnon-classical mechanism, such as wetting-mediated nucleation (where the growing\nvapor nucleus is wetted by the intermediate low-density liquid phase) and the\nOstwald step rule at low temperatures. Isochoric cooling pathways also revealed\nnotable differences in T-dependent nucleation barrier trends between the TCP\nand CPF scenarios.

To test available phenomenological models, new data on the jet\ndeformation at impact and on the entrained air flow rate were collected both on\na small-scale (height of fall H about 1 m, jet diameter D0 = 7.6 mm) and a\nlarge-scale (H up to 9 m, D0 up to 213 mm) facilities. Conditions for which jet\nbreak-up occurred were not considered. For short heights of fall (H less than a\nfew D0), the jet deformation remains smaller than 0.1 jet diameter, and the\nentrained air flow rate happens to grow as Ui^3/2, where Ui is the jet velocity\nat impact. This scaling agrees with the air film model proposed by Sene, 1988.\nAt larger fall heights, even though conditions leading to jet break-up were\navoided, the jets exhibited complex topologies, including strong deformations\nand/or interface stripping and/or jet aeration. Further, the roughness model\ninitiated by Henderson, McCarthy and Molloy, 1970 which stipulates that the\nentrained air flow rate corresponds to the air trapped within jet corrugations,\nwas found valid for these conditions. More precisely, for corrugated jets, the\neffective roughness amounts to the maximum jet deformation (as measured from\nthe 90% detection probability on the diameter pdf) or equivalently to about two\ntimes the total deformation of one side of the jet (where the total deformation\nof one side of the jet is experimentally evaluated as the standard deviation of\nthe position of one jet edge). However, for jets experiencing strong stripping\nor aeration (the latter being identified by a threshold on the growth of the\njet diameter with the falling distance), the effective roughness amounts to\nabout 0.8 times the maximum jet deformation or equivalently to 1.1 times the\ntotal deformation of one side of the jet. Compared with corrugated jets, the\neffective roughness is thus diminished by half.",

More specifically, we initially unify\nthe representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks.\nSubsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather\ndata modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we\nadopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of\nunified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our\nWeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks,\nincluding weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and\npost-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen\ntasks.",

Without profound insights into the\nthree-dimensional nature of the data, this task remains unattainable. Our work\naddresses this challenge of 3D shape completion given partial observations by\nproposing a transformer operating on the latent space representing Signed\nDistance Fields (SDFs). Instead of a monolithic volume, the SDF of an object is\npartitioned into smaller high-resolution patches leading to a sequence of\nlatent codes. The approach relies on a smooth latent space encoding learned via\na variational autoencoder (VAE), trained on millions of 3D patches. We employ\nan efficient masked autoencoder transformer to complete partial sequences into\ncomprehensive shapes in latent space. Our approach is extensively evaluated on\npartial observations from ShapeNet and the ABC dataset where only fractions of\nthe objects are given.

Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal\ndistinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and\ncharge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06\nconsistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to\nPBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting\nbehavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin\npolarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker\nmagnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower\nbarriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher\nmobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties,\ncalculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in\nthe far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types\ndemonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si\nand C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic\nproperties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect\nengineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications.

    "abstract": "To identify what types of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior are most likely to\noccur in cubic metals due to doublet impurities, we derive every cubic\nsymmetry-allowed, NFL, Kondo-type exchange coupling. We find three distinct\ntypes of NFL behavior: two-channel Kondo (2CK) behavior for a non-Kramers\ndoublet impurity coupled to local $\\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons; topological\nKondo physics for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\\Gamma_4$ or $\\Gamma_5$\nconduction electrons; and lastly, spin-half impurity spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$\nconduction electron Kondo behavior for a Kramers doublet impurity and\n$\\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons. The first two critical behaviors are not\nstraightforward to realize. In the first case, 2CK physics is not guaranteed,\nsince cubic symmetry does not prevent an effective spatial anisotropy from\nexceeding the 2CK coupling, which restores a Fermi liquid behavior. In the\nsecond case, the topological Kondo interaction is guaranteed to dominate,\nhowever, the spin degeneracy of the conduction electrons needs to be lifted\ne.g. by a magnetic field$-$so that they can be represented by $\\Gamma_4$ or\n$\\Gamma_5$ triplets$-$which then also lifts the degeneracy of the Kramers\ndoublet. We find that the spin-half impurity spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ conduction\nelectron, NFL, Kondo behavior has the greatest chance of existing in diluted,\ncubic compounds. We compute the thermodynamics of the topological Kondo model\nusing the numerical renormalization group, and discuss the thermodynamics of\nthe spin-half impurity spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo model.

The performance of ORAM is often limited by its\ninherent trade-off between security and efficiency, as concealing memory access\npatterns imposes significant computational and memory overhead. While prior\nworks focus on improving the ORAM performance by prefetching and eliminating\nORAM requests, we find that their performance is very sensitive to workload\nlocality behavior and incurs additional management overhead caused by the ORAM\nstash pressure.\n  This paper presents Palermo: a protocol-hardware co-design to improve ORAM\nperformance. The key observation in Palermo is that classical ORAM protocols\nenforce restrictive dependencies between memory operations that result in low\nmemory bandwidth utilization. Palermo introduces a new protocol that overlaps\nlarge portions of memory operations, within a single and between multiple ORAM\nrequests, without breaking correctness and security guarantees. Subsequently,\nwe propose an ORAM controller architecture that executes the proposed protocol\nto service ORAM requests. The hardware is responsible for concurrently issuing\nmemory requests as well as imposing the necessary dependencies to ensure a\nconsistent view of the ORAM tree across requests. Using a rich workload mix, we\ndemonstrate that Palermo outperforms the RingORAM baseline by 2.8x, on average,\nincurring a negligible area overhead of 5.78mm^2 (less than 2% in 12th\ngeneration Intel CPU after technology scaling) and 2.14W without sacrificing\nsecurity.

The SPR stability is\nstudied for an anodic (hollow, meshed) IFB for the first time against the\ntraditional cathode-plasma arrangements of regular electrode (solid, smooth)\nfireballs. The SPR develops near a spherical electrode enclosed by a plasma\nsheath amid a given electric potential. A generalized linear quartic dispersion\nrelation (DR) with diverse plasma multi-parametric coefficients is methodically\nderived using a standard normal mode analysis. The mathematical construction of\nthe obtained DR roots confirms that only one feasible nonzero frequency mode\nexists (emerging in the IFB). This root existence is confirmed both\nanalytically and numerically. This consequent SPR creates trapped acoustic\nfluctuations in the IFB plasmas because of the internal reflections at the\nsheath plasma boundary. Also, sensible parametric changes in the SPR features,\nwith both plasma density and viscosity, are seen. A local condition for the SPR\nexcitation and its subsequent transition to collective standing wave-like\npatterns in the IFBs is illustrated.

Additionally, TIC 8677671 and TIC\n318217844 demonstrate secular cyclical changes of orbital periods.\nSpecifically, for TIC 8677671, the cyclical change could result from magnetic\nactivity or a third body which is likely to be compact, with a mass of at least\n2.97 M$_{\\odot}$.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel lift-and-embed learning method to effectively resolve these\nchallenges. The proposed method comprises three innovative components: (i)\nembedding the Rankine-Hugoniot condition within a one-order higher-dimensional\nspace by including an augmented variable; (ii) utilizing neural networks to\nhandle the increased dimensionality and address both linear and nonlinear\nproblems within a unified mesh-free learning framework; and (iii) projecting\nthe trained model back onto the original physical domain to obtain the\napproximate solution. Notably, the location of discontinuities also can be\ntreated as trainable parameters in our method and inferred concurrently with\nthe training of neural network solutions. With collocation points sampled only\non piecewise surfaces rather than fulfilling the whole lifted space, we\ndemonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our method can\nefficiently and accurately solve scalar hyperbolic equations with discontinuous\nsolutions without spurious smearing or oscillations.",

Here, using detailed physical\nmodels, we show that the dirtiness in a superconductor enforces a sensitivity\nand bandwidth trade-off in all practical devices. More importantly, a certain\ndegree of dirtiness is a necessary requirement for achieving single photon\ndetection. Under typical bias conditions close to the transition setpoints, the\nminimum number of photons required to register a voltage pulse decreases by the\ndirtiness parameter (Ioffe-Regel parameter) and the reset time of SNSPD\nincreases by the same dirtiness parameter, thereby giving a constant value for\nthe sensitivity-bandwidth product. The constant is weakly modified by biasing\ncurrent and the temperature. Since dirtiness in the superconducting nanowire is\na physically controllable parameter with an important bearing on the final\nresponse of an SNSPD, this work opens new opportunities to develop SNSPD\ndevices with engineered sensitivity-bandwidth setpoint as dictated by an\napplication.",

    "abstract": "We report the results of a comprehensive study of the spectroscopic binary\n(SB2) system HD 34736 hosting two chemically peculiar (CP) late B-type stars.\nUsing new and archival observational data, we characterise the system and its\ncomponents, including their rotation and magnetic fields. Fitting of the radial\nvelocities yields $P_\\mathrm{orb}=83.\\!^\\mathrm{d}219(3)$ and $e=0.8103(3)$.\nThe primary component is a CP He-wk star with $T_{\\mathrm{eff}A}=13000\\pm500$ K\nand $\\upsilon_\\mathrm{e}\\sin i\\;=75\\pm3$ km/s, while the secondary exhibits\nvariability of Mg and Si lines, and has $T_{\\mathrm{eff}B}=11500\\pm1000$ K and\n$\\upsilon_\\mathrm{e}\\sin i=110$-180 km/s. TESS and KELT photometry reveal clear\nvariability of the primary component with a rotational period\n$P_{\\mathrm{rot}A}=1.\\!^\\mathrm{d}279\\,988\\,5(11)$, which is lengthening at a\nrate of $1.26(6)$ s/yr. For the secondary,\n$P_{\\mathrm{rot}B}=0.\\!^\\mathrm{d}522\\,693\\,8(5)$, reducing at a rate of\n$-0.14(3)$ s/yr. The longitudinal component $\\langle B_\\mathrm{z}\\rangle$ of\nthe primary's strongly asymmetric global magnetic field varies from $-6$ to +5\nkG. Weak spectropolarimetric evidence of a magnetic field is found for the\nsecondary star. The observed X-ray and radio emission of HD 34736 may equally\nbe linked to a suspected T Tau-like companion or magnetospheric emission from\nthe principal components. Given the presence of a possible third magnetically\nactive body, one can propose that the magnetic characteristics of the\nprotostellar environment may be connected to the formation of such systems.",

They are used to simulate complex\ndynamic systems and inform decision-making. In this paper, we introduce\nBayesianFitForecast, an R toolbox specifically developed to streamline Bayesian\nparameter estimation and forecasting in ODE models, making it particularly\nrelevant to health informatics and public health decision-making. The toolbox\nis available at https://github.com/gchowell/BayesianFitForecast/.\n  Results: This toolbox enables automatic generation of Stan files, allowing\nusers to configure models, define priors, and analyze results with minimal\nprogramming expertise. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of\nBayesianFitForecast, we apply it to the analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic\nin San Francisco, comparing Poisson and negative binomial error structures\nwithin the SEIR model. We also test it by fitting multiple time series of state\nvariables using simulated data. BayesianFitForecast provides robust tools for\nevaluating model performance, including convergence diagnostics, posterior\ndistributions, credible intervals, and performance metrics.\n  Conclusion: By improving the accessibility of advanced Bayesian methods, this\ntoolbox significantly broadens the application of Bayesian inference methods to\ndynamical systems critical for healthcare and epidemiological forecasting.

The convergence of intermediate-state excitations has\nbeen examined in evaluating the effective interactions, and the\ncore-polarization effects are illustrated, by using $^{18}$O as an example.\nEmploying the CI-RHF model, both the bulk properties and low-lying spectra of\neven-even nuclei $^{18\\sim 28}$Ne have been well reproduced with the model\nspace restricted to the $sd$ shell. Studies of the isotopic evolution\nconcerning charge radii and low-lying spectra highlight the shell closure at\n$N=14$ for neon isotopes. Furthermore, the cross-shell calculations extending\nfrom the $sd$ to $pf$ shell successfully reproduced the low-lying spectra of\n$^{30}$Ne and $^{32}$Ne.

    "abstract": "Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent the spread of diseases.\nHowever, hesitancy and rejection of vaccines, particularly in childhood\nimmunizations, pose challenges to vaccination efforts. In that case, according\nto rational decision-making and classical utility theory, parents weigh the\ncosts of vaccination against the costs of not vaccinating their children.\nSocial norms influence these parental decision-making outcomes, deviating their\ndecisions from rationality. Additionally, variability in values of utilities\nstemming from stochasticity in parents' perceptions over time can lead to\nfurther deviations from rationality. In this paper, we employ independent white\nnoises to represent stochastic fluctuations in parental perceptions of utility\nfunctions of the decisions over time, as well as in the disease transmission\nrates. This approach leads to a system of stochastic differential equations of\na susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model coupled with a stochastic\nreplicator equation. We explore the dynamics of these equations and identify\nnew behaviors emerging from stochastic influences. Interestingly, incorporating\nstochasticity into the utility functions for vaccination and nonvaccination\nleads to a decision-making model that reflects the bounded rationality of\nhumans. Noise, like social norms, is a two-sided sword that depends on the\ndegree of bounded rationality of each group. We also perform a stochastic\noptimal control as a discount to the cost of vaccination to counteract bounded\nrationality.",

    "abstract": "When interacting with an environment, the entanglement within quantum\nmany-body systems is rapidly transferred to the entanglement between the system\nand the bath. For systems with a large local Hilbert space dimension, this\nleads to a first-order entanglement transition for the reduced density matrix\nof the system. On the other hand, recent studies have introduced a new paradigm\nfor classifying density matrices, with particular focus on scenarios where a\nstrongly symmetric density matrix undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking to a\nweak symmetry phase. This is typically characterized by a finite R\\'enyi-2\ncorrelator or a finite Wightman correlator. In this work, we study the\nentanglement transition from the perspective of strong-to-weak symmetry\nbreaking, using solvable complex Brownian SYK models. We perform analytical\ncalculations for both the early-time and late-time saddles. The results show\nthat while the R\\'enyi-2 correlator indicates a transition from symmetric to\nsymmetry-broken phase, the Wightman correlator becomes finite even in the\nearly-time saddle due to the single-replica limit, demonstrating that the\nfirst-order transition occurs between a near-symmetric phase and a deeply\nsymmetry-broken phase in the sense of Wightman correlator. Our results provide\na novel viewpoint on the entanglement transition under symmetry constraints and\ncan be readily generalized to systems with repeated measurements.",

In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy\nmay be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher.

In positron emission tomography\n(PET), the reduction in tracer dose leads to information loss in sino-grams.\nUsing diffusion models to reconstruct missing in-formation can improve imaging\nquality. Traditional diffu-sion models effectively use Gaussian noise for image\nre-constructions. However, in low-dose PET reconstruction, Gaussian noise can\nworsen the already sparse data by introducing artifacts and inconsistencies. To\naddress this issue, we propose a diffusion model named residual esti-mation\ndiffusion (RED). From the perspective of diffusion mechanism, RED uses the\nresidual between sinograms to replace Gaussian noise in diffusion process,\nrespectively sets the low-dose and full-dose sinograms as the starting point\nand endpoint of reconstruction. This mechanism helps preserve the original\ninformation in the low-dose sinogram, thereby enhancing reconstruction\nreliability. From the perspective of data consistency, RED introduces a drift\ncorrection strategy to reduce accumulated prediction errors during the reverse\nprocess. Calibrating the inter-mediate results of reverse iterations helps\nmaintain the data consistency and enhances the stability of reconstruc-tion\nprocess. Experimental results show that RED effec-tively improves the quality\nof low-dose sinograms as well as the reconstruction results. The code is\navailable at: https://github.com/yqx7150/RED.",

We investigate how the modulation\nparameters change the bandstructure of the Moir\\'e PTC and the temporal\nlocalization behavior. Moreover, we explore mode-locking mechanism in frequency\nspace in the Moir\\'e PTC, which points towards potential applications in\nmode-locked lasers with tunable time width of the emitted pulses. Our work\ntherefore extends the study of PTC to complex modulation patterns, and unveils\nnew possibility in wave manipulation with time-varying systems.",

The universal geometry mimics aspects of the original heterotic\nvacua, in particular holomorphic data such as F-terms, as well as the\nGreen-Schwarz Bianchi identity. Here we study first order deformations of the\nuniversal geometry and find this provides a shortcut to computing second order\ndeformations of the original problem. The equations governing the moduli of the\nuniversal geometry are remarkably similar to the equations of the underlying\nheterotic theory and we find a fascinating double extension structure that\nmirrors the original heterotic problem. As an application we find first order\nuniversal deformations determine second order deformations of the original\nheterotic theory. This gives a shortcut to determining results that are\notherwise algebraically unwieldy. The role of the D-terms is closely related to\nthe existence of flat connections on the moduli space. Finally, we re-derive\nsome of these results by direct differentiation - this direct approach requires\nsignificantly more calculation.",

However, the StarCraft II platform, which has\nbeen widely adopted for validating decision-making algorithms in the past\ndecade, has not yet provided substantial support for this emerging domain. To\naddress issues that LLMs cannot interface with the hundreds of actions of the\npysc2 backend and the lack of native support for multi-agent (MA)\ncollaboration, we propose the LLM-PySC2 environment. This is the first\nenvironment that offers LLMs the complete pysc2 action space with sufficient\nmulti-modal information and game Wiki knowledge. With an asynchronous query\narchitecture, the environment efficiently interacts with LLMs that maintain a\nconstant latency regardless of the scale of the agents' population. In the\nexperiments, we evaluated LLMs' decision-making performance in both the\nmacro-decision and micro-operation scenarios, with traditional StarCraft II\nMulti-Agent Challenge (SMAC) tasks and a series of new proposed. Results\nindicate that LLMs possess the potential to achieve victories in complex\nscenarios but cannot constantly generate correct decisions, especially in the\nrecovered pysc2 action space and MA settings.

In\nthis work, we analyze the bending fluctuations and the bending response of a\ngrafted rFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. We obtain a recursion\nrelation for the partition function of the grafted rFJC under bending force,\nwhich allows, in principle, exact-numerical calculation of the behavior of a\nrFJC of arbitrary size.

We investigate\nthe spectral width of maximum deposition eigenchannels over a range of target\ndepths using numerical simulations of a 2D diffusive system. Compared to tight\nfocusing into the system, power deposition to an extended region is more\nsensitive to frequency detuning. The spectral width of enhanced delivery to a\nlarge target displays a rather weak, non-monotonic variation with target depth,\nin contrast to a sharp drop of focusing bandwidth with depth. While the maximum\nenhancement of power deposited within a diffusive system can exceed that of\npower transmitted through it, this comes at the cost of a narrower spectral\nwidth. We investigate the narrower deposition width in terms of the\nconstructive interference of transmission eigenchannels within the target. We\nfurther observe that the spatial field distribution inside the target region\ndecorrelates slower with spectral detuning than power decay of the maximum\ndeposition eigenchannel.

This paper tackles this issue by\nleveraging the forgery quality of training data to improve the generalization\nperformance of existing deepfake detectors. Generally, the forgery quality of\ndifferent deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while\nothers are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of\ndeepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to\nshort-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby\nhurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel\nquality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of\na Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning\npacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training\nprocess. Our framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to\ngradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples,\nstarting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ\nboth static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining\ntheir scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating\nscore guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated\nsamples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a\nnovel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality\nforgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their\noverall realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework\ncan be applied plug-and-play to existing detection models and significantly\nenhance their generalization performance in detection.",

This approach\noften involves using a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration\nplatform, which supports the deployment of microservices. However, this shift\nintroduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of\ncontainerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable\nscenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and\nvariable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often\noverlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running\nmicroservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes.\nConsequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from\nsignificant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we\nintroduce a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE.\nThis framework can adaptively redeploy microservice containers to maintain\ndesired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the\nhosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes\nplatform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a\nreal compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our\nframework's performance in various scenarios.

    "abstract": "The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D\nvolumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose\nsignificant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems,\nthe existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the\ntraining stage, leading to a separation between representation training and\ncompression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF\nrepresentation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed\nrate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a\nsimple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the\nNeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model\nis utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy\nmodel is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF\nrepresentation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby\nleading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive\nquantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF\nrepresentations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the\nrate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for\ndifferent representations and experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and\nachieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on\nthe HumanRF and ReRF datasets.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable\nphases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion\nsource for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force\nis often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors.\nFirst-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more\npowerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been\nexperimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction\npathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \\beta-LiGaO2 to\n\\beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective\nprovided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as\npowerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through\nstraightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial\nstrategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources,\nthereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.",

    "abstract": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) leverage massive parallelism and large\nmemory bandwidth to support high-performance computing applications, such as\nmultimedia rendering, crypto-mining, deep learning, and natural language\nprocessing. These applications require models and datasets that are getting\nbigger in size and currently challenge the memory capacity of a single GPU,\ncausing substantial performance overheads. To address this problem, a\nprogrammer has to partition the data and manually transfer data in and out of\nthe GPU. This approach requires programmers to carefully tune their\napplications and can be impractical for workloads with irregular access\npatterns, such as deep learning, recommender systems, and graph applications.\nTo ease programmability, programming abstractions such as unified virtual\nmemory (UVM) can be used, creating a virtually unified memory space across the\nwhole system and transparently moving the data on demand as it is accessed.\nHowever, UVM brings in the overhead of the OS involvement and inefficiencies\ndue to generating many transfer requests especially when the GPU memory is\noversubscribed. This paper proposes GPUVM, a GPU memory management system that\nuses an RDMA-capable network device to construct a virtual memory system\nwithout involving the CPU/OS. GPUVM enables on-demand paging for GPU\napplications and relies on GPU threads for memory management and page\nmigration. Since CPU chipsets do not support GPU-driven memory management, we\nuse a network interface card to facilitate transparent page migration from/to\nthe GPU. GPUVM achieves performance up to 4x higher than UVM for latency-bound\napplications while providing accessible programming abstractions that do not\nrequire the users to manage memory transfers directly.",

To quantify\nthe relationship between host age and Hubble residual (HR), we employed two\nlinear regression techniques: LINMIX, which assumes a Gaussian age error, and\nBayesian hierarchical linear regression, which utilizes a full posterior for\nthe age error. Both models demonstrate a robust correlation between host age\nand HR, with high statistical significance approaching $5.5 \\sigma$. While our\nnew regression analyses yield the slopes that are similar or slightly shallower\ncompared to our previous results, the significance of these slopes has notably\nincreased.

Unfortunately, traditional methods employing a\nuniform rate factor (RF) across all videos often result in significant\ninefficiencies. Content-adaptive encoding (CAE) techniques address this by\ndynamically adjusting encoding parameters based on video content\ncharacteristics. However, existing CAE methods are often tightly coupled with\nspecific encoding strategies, leading to inflexibility. In this paper, we\npropose a model that predicts both RF-quality and RF-bitrate curves, which can\nbe utilized to derive a comprehensive bitrate-quality curve. This approach\nfacilitates flexible adjustments to the encoding strategy without necessitating\nmodel retraining. The model leverages codec features, content features, and\nanchor features to predict the bitrate-quality curve accurately. Additionally,\nwe introduce an anchor suspension method to enhance prediction accuracy.\nExperiments confirm that the actual quality metric (VMAF) of the compressed\nvideo stays within 1 of the target, achieving an accuracy of 99.14%.

    "abstract": "The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for\napproximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses\nthe Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting\nproperties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in\nnon-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In\nthis study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field\nmixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical\nguarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough\n$p$ such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation\nratio of $1$. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically\ncomputed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly\nmonotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are\ncomputed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair\nsampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the\nground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported\non several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair\nsampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which\nexhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with\ntransverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show\nthat some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of $0$ with a\nmaximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an\napproximation ratio of $1$ while other problem instances never deviate from a\nmaximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any $p$ step.",

During the uplink training\nstage, user terminals (UTs) transmit reference signals for simultaneous channel\nestimation and location sensing. This stage leverages an elaborately designed\nhybrid-field projection matrix to overcome the HFBS effect and estimate the\nchannel in compressive manner.

By\ntreating the sensed scatterers as virtual anchors, we employ a weighted\nleast-squares approach to derive UT' s location. Moreover, we propose an\niterative refinement mechanism, which utilizes the accurately estimated time\ndifference of arrival of multipath components to enhance location sensing\nprecision. In the following downlink data transmission stage, we leverage the\nacquired location information to further optimize the hybrid beamformer, which\ncombines the beam broadening and focusing to mitigate the spectral efficiency\ndegradation resulted from the HFBS effect.

Since\nmatching subsequences in DNA converge in space in 3D chaos game encoding, a DNA\nsequence's 3D chaos game representation can be used to compare DNA sequences\nwithout prior alignment and without truncating or padding any of the sequences.\nTwo proposed methods inspired by shape-similarity comparison techniques show\nthat this form of encoding can perform as well as alignment-based techniques\nfor building phylogenetic trees. The first method uses the volume overlap of\nintersecting spheres and the second uses shape signatures by summarizing the\ncoordinates, oriented angles, and oriented distances of the 3D chaos game\ntrajectory. The methods are tested using: (1) the first exon of the beta-globin\ngene for 11 species, (2) mitochondrial DNA from four groups of primates, and\n(3) a set of synthetic DNA sequences.

Homomorphic\nEncryption provides a promising solution by encrypting model updates to protect\nagainst such attacks, but it introduces substantial communication overhead,\nslowing down training and increasing computational costs. To address these\nchallenges, we propose QuanCrypt-FL, a novel algorithm that combines low-bit\nquantization and pruning techniques to enhance protection against attacks while\nsignificantly reducing computational costs during training.

In the MetaICL in-context learning evaluation, our method achieves an\naverage accuracy of $44.9$ across 26 tasks, outperforming the base model. On\nMSC, our method proves to be highly competitive in memorizing user information\nfrom conversations with a 4x reduction in computation and memory costs compared\nto prompting with full conversation history. Together, these results suggest\nthat $GenerativeAdapter$ should allow for general adaption to a wide range of\ndifferent contexts.",

When $\\lambda$ is infinite, the proof\nis based on an ideal version of Eklof's Lemma. When $\\lambda$ is an infinite\nregular cardinal, the Generalized $\\lambda$-Generating Hypothesis is\nestablished for the ghost ideal $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mathcal{S}}$ for the case when\n$\\mathcal A$ a locally $\\lambda$-presentable Grothendieck category and\n$\\mathcal{S}$ is a set of $\\lambda$-presentable objects in $\\mathcal A$ such\nthat $^\\perp (\\mathcal{S}^\\perp)$ contains a generating set for $\\mathcal A.$\n  As a consequence of $\\lambda$-GGH for the ghost ideal\n$\\mathfrak{g}_{R\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{mod}}$ in the category of modules\n$R\\mbox{-}\\mathrm{Mod}$ over a ring, it is shown that if the class of pure\nprojective left $R$-modules is closed under extensions, then every left\nFP-projective module is pure projective.

    "abstract": "This study presents an extension of the corrected Smagorinsky model,\nincorporating advanced techniques for error estimation and regularity analysis\nof far-from-equilibrium turbulent flows. A new formulation that increases the\nmodel's ability to explain complex dissipative processes in turbulence is\npresented, using higher-order Sobolev spaces to address incompressible and\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Specifically, a refined energy\ndissipation mechanism that provides a more accurate representation of\nturbulence is introduced, particularly in the context of multifractal flow\nregimes. Furthermore, we derive new theoretical results on energy\nregularization in multifractal turbulence, contributing to the understanding of\nanomalous dissipation and vortex stretching in turbulent flows. The work also\nexplores the numerical implementation of the model in the presence of\nchallenging boundary conditions, particularly in dynamically evolving domains,\nwhere traditional methods struggle to maintain accuracy and stability.\nTheoretical demonstrations and analytical results are provided to validate the\nproposed framework, with implications for theoretical advances and practical\napplications in computational fluid dynamics. This approach provides a basis\nfor more accurate simulations of turbulence, with potential applications\nranging from atmospheric modeling to industrial fluid dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, a growing number of data platforms have emerged,\nincluding data commons, data repositories, and databases containing biomedical,\nenvironmental, social determinants of health and other data relevant to\nimproving health outcomes. With the growing number of data platforms,\ninteroperating multiple data platforms to form data meshes, data fabrics and\nother types of data ecosystems reduces data silos, expands data use, and\nincreases the potential for new discoveries. In this paper, we introduce ten\nprinciples, which we call pillars, for data meshes. The goals of the principles\nare 1) to make it easier, faster, and more uniform to set up a data mesh from\nmultiple data platforms; and, 2) to make it easier, faster, and more uniform,\nfor a data platform to join one or more data meshes. The hope is that the\ngreater availability of data through data meshes will accelerate research and\nthat the greater uniformity of meshes will lower the cost of developing meshes\nand connecting a data platform to them.",

    "abstract": "The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital\nsecurity and applications that fairly distribute resources. However, existing\nrandom number generators have limitations-the generation processes cannot be\nfully traced, audited, and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps\nused in pseudorandom number generators are auditable, but they cannot guarantee\nthat their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial\nseed. Device-independent quantum random number generators can ensure that the\nsource of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the\nrandomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here, for the first time, we\ndemonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on\ndevice-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from\nunpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined\nhash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This\nprotocol is at the heart of a public traceable and certifiable quantum\nrandomness beacon that we have launched. Over the first 40 days of operation,\nwe completed the protocol 7434 out of 7454 attempts -- a success rate of 99.7%.\nEach time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of\ntraceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error times\nactual success probability bounded by $2^{-64}$. The generation of certifiable\nand traceable randomness represents one of the first public services that\noperates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical\napproaches.",

CSM extends Coarsened\nExact Matching by incorporating general distance metrics, adaptive calipers,\nand locally constructed synthetic controls. We show that CSM can be viewed as a\nmonotonic imbalance bounding matching method, so that it inherits the usual\nbounds on imbalance and bias enjoyed by MIB methods. We further provide a bound\non a measure of joint covariate imbalance. Using a simulation study, we\nillustrate how CSM can even outperform modern matching methods in certain\nsettings, and finally illustrate its use in an empirical example. Overall, we\nfind CSM allows for many of the benefits of matching while avoiding some of the\ncosts.",
