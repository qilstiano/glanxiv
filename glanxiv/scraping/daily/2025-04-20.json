    "abstract": "The exponential growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to highlight\nthe need for efficient strategies to meet ever-expanding computational and data\ndemands. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of two complementary\nparadigms: Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD), both\naimed at compressing LLMs while preserving their advanced reasoning\ncapabilities and linguistic diversity. We first examine key methodologies in\nKD, such as task-specific alignment, rationale-based training, and\nmulti-teacher frameworks, alongside DD techniques that synthesize compact,\nhigh-impact datasets through optimization-based gradient matching, latent space\nregularization, and generative synthesis. Building on these foundations, we\nexplore how integrating KD and DD can produce more effective and scalable\ncompression strategies. Together, these approaches address persistent\nchallenges in model scalability, architectural heterogeneity, and the\npreservation of emergent LLM abilities. We further highlight applications\nacross domains such as healthcare and education, where distillation enables\nefficient deployment without sacrificing performance. Despite substantial\nprogress, open challenges remain in preserving emergent reasoning and\nlinguistic diversity, enabling efficient adaptation to continually evolving\nteacher models and datasets, and establishing comprehensive evaluation\nprotocols. By synthesizing methodological innovations, theoretical foundations,\nand practical insights, our survey charts a path toward sustainable,\nresource-efficient LLMs through the tighter integration of KD and DD\nprinciples.",

This\nselective perfect memory creates a fundamental issue -- when testing\nforecasting capabilities before their knowledge cutoff dates, we cannot\ndistinguish whether LLMs are forecasting or simply accessing memorized data.\nExplicit instructions to respect historical data boundaries fail to prevent\nLLMs from achieving recall-level accuracy in forecasting tasks.

Beyond these applications, it also proves\nessential in photoemission spectroscopy (PES) at high photon energies, aiding\nin the disentanglement of complex angle-resolved PES data and enabling\nemitter-site-specific studies. However, the detection and analysis of these\nrich faint structures in photoelectron diffraction (PED), especially in the\nhard X-ray regime, remain highly challenging, with only a limited number of\nsimulations successfully reproducing these patterns. The strong energy\ndependence of Kikuchi patterns further complicates their interpretation,\nnecessitating advanced theoretical approaches. To enhance structural analysis,\nwe present a comprehensive theoretical study of fine diffraction patterns and\ntheir evolution with energy by simulating core-level emissions from Ge(100) and\nSi(100). Using multiple-scattering theory and the fully relativistic one-step\nphotoemission model, we simulate faint pattern networks for various core levels\nacross different kinetic energies (106 eV - 4174 eV), avoiding cluster size\nconvergence issues inherent in cluster-based methods. Broadening in patterns is\ndiscussed via the inelastic scattering treatment. For the first time, circular\ndichroism has been observed and successfully reproduced in the angular\ndistribution of Si (100) 1s, revealing detailed features and asymmetries up to\n31%. Notably, we successfully replicate experimental bulk and more\n\"surface-sensitivity\" diffraction features, further validating the robustness\nof our simulations.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language\nmodeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching\nnetwork in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes\nthe score function of some initial distribution can only perform language\nmodeling within the $\\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations\ntied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no\nrequirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion\nmodeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy\nprovides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion\nmodels, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We\nconjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where\nthe diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider\ncontext and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning\narchitecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of\noperation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.",

The incorporation of amorphous grain boundary complexions has been\nproposed to address these issues, by simultaneously stabilizing nanocrystalline\ngrain structures for scale-up processing and improving alloy toughness. In the\npresent study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is\nexamined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is\nrelevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated\nvia a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures\nand times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural\nand property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered\ncubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles\nexhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles.\nAppreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800\nMPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions.\nMicrostructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area\nfraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most\nimportantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with\nincreasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly\nenhancing plasticity.

Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing\nsingle-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches.\nAccordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and\nintroduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate\npredictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This\nhybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly\nintegrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize\nthis bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by\npredicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly\nboosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model\nlong-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal\ntransformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to\ngenerate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise\na layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of\nlow-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening\npredictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by\nscrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding\npredictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the\nefficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task\napproach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach.

    "abstract": "During the past decades, numerous successes of AI has been made on \"specific\ncapabilities\", named closed-world, such as artificial environments or specific\nreal-world tasks. This well-defined narrow capability brings two nice benefits,\na clear criterion of success and the opportunity to collect a lot of examples.\nThe criteria not only reveal whether a machine has achieved a goal, but reveal\nhow the machine falls short of the goal. As a result, human designers can fix\nthe problems one after the other until the machine is deemed good enough for\nthe task. Furthermore, the large set of collected examples reduces the\ndifficulty of this problem-fixing process (by the central limit theorem).\n  Do the success in closed-world translate into broad open-world, where a\nmachine is required to perform any task that a human could possibly undertake\nwith fewer examples and less priori knowledge from human designers? No. Because\ncompetence in a specific task provides little insight in handling other tasks,\nthe valuable criteria for specific tasks become helpless when handling broader\nunseen tasks. Furthermore, due to the shortage of examples in unseen tasks,\ncentral limit theorem does not stand on our side. At the end, human designers\nlose the oscilloscope to \"hack\" an AI system for the open-world.\n  Achieving AI for the open-world requires unique learning principles and\ninnovated techniques, which are different from the ones in building AI for the\nclosed-world. This thesis explores necessary learning principles required to\nconstruct AI for the open-world, including rich features (analogy a large tool\nbox), disentangled representation (an organized tool box), and inference-time\nlearning (a tool-savvy hand). Driven by the learning principles, this thesis\nfurther proposes techniques to use the learning principles, conducts enormous\nlarge-scale experiments to verify the learning principles.",

Cosmic variance in the IGM, however, is a major source of stochasticity\nsince the local neutral environment around a quasar varies significantly even\nat fixed global neutral fraction. We show that the IGM damping wing carries\nadditional information about this local ionization topology, unexploited by\ncurrent analysis frameworks. We introduce a set of two new physically motivated\nsummary statistics encoding the local information about the HI distribution in\nthe IGM before it is altered by ionization radiation from the quasar,\nencompassing 1) the HI column density, weighted by a Lorentzian profile\nmimicking the frequency dependence of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ cross section, and 2)\nthe distance from the quasar to the first neutral patch.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the tunability of the Random Survival Forest (RSF)\nmodel in predictive maintenance, where accurate time-to-failure estimation is\ncrucial. Although RSF is widely used due to its flexibility and ability to\nhandle censored data, its performance is sensitive to hyperparameter\nconfigurations. However, systematic evaluations of RSF tunability remain\nlimited, especially in predictive maintenance contexts. We introduce a\nthree-level framework to quantify tunability: (1) a model-level metric\nmeasuring overall performance gain from tuning, (2) a hyperparameter-level\nmetric assessing individual contributions, and (3) identification of optimal\ntuning ranges. These metrics are evaluated across multiple datasets using\nsurvival-specific criteria: the C-index for discrimination and the Brier score\nfor calibration. Experiments on four CMAPSS dataset subsets, simulating\naircraft engine degradation, reveal that hyperparameter tuning consistently\nimproves model performance. On average, the C-index increased by 0.0547, while\nthe Brier score decreased by 0.0199. These gains were consistent across all\nsubsets. Moreover, ntree and mtry showed the highest average tunability, while\nnodesize offered stable improvements within the range of 10 to 30. In contrast,\nsplitrule demonstrated negative tunability on average, indicating that improper\ntuning may reduce model performance. Our findings emphasize the practical\nimportance of hyperparameter tuning in survival models and provide actionable\ninsights for optimizing RSF in real-world predictive maintenance applications.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a novel optimization solution framework, called\nalternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization (AltGDmin), that is useful\nfor many problems for which alternating minimization (AltMin) is a popular\nsolution. AltMin is a special case of the block coordinate descent algorithm\nthat is useful for problems in which minimization w.r.t one subset of variables\nkeeping the other fixed is closed form or otherwise reliably solved. Denote the\ntwo blocks/subsets of the optimization variables Z by Za, Zb, i.e., Z = {Za,\nZb}. AltGDmin is often a faster solution than AltMin for any problem for which\n(i) the minimization over one set of variables, Zb, is much quicker than that\nover the other set, Za; and (ii) the cost function is differentiable w.r.t. Za.\nOften, the reason for one minimization to be quicker is that the problem is\n``decoupled\" for Zb and each of the decoupled problems is quick to solve. This\ndecoupling is also what makes AltGDmin communication-efficient for federated\nsettings.\n  Important examples where this assumption holds include (a) low rank\ncolumn-wise compressive sensing (LRCS), low rank matrix completion (LRMC), (b)\ntheir outlier-corrupted extensions such as robust PCA, robust LRCS and robust\nLRMC; (c) phase retrieval and its sparse and low-rank model based extensions;\n(d) tensor extensions of many of these problems such as tensor LRCS and tensor\ncompletion; and (e) many partly discrete problems where GD does not apply --\nsuch as clustering, unlabeled sensing, and mixed linear regression. LRCS finds\nimportant applications in multi-task representation learning and few shot\nlearning, federated sketching, and accelerated dynamic MRI. LRMC and robust PCA\nfind important applications in recommender systems, computer vision and video\nanalytics.",

However, these methods struggle to\nproduce samples with the correct proportions for each mode in multimodal\ndistributions, especially for distributions with well separated modes. To\naddress the challenges posed by multimodality, we adopt a divide-and-conquer\nstrategy. We start by minimizing the energy function with initial guesses\nuniformly distributed within the prior domain to identify all the modes of the\nenergy function. Then, we train a classifier to segment the domain\ncorresponding to each mode. After the domain decomposition, we train a\ndiffusion-model-assisted generative model for each identified mode within its\nsupport. Once each mode is characterized, we employ bridge sampling to estimate\nthe normalizing constant, allowing us to directly adjust the ratios between the\nmodes. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework can\neffectively handle multimodal distributions with varying mode shapes in up to\n100 dimensions.

Contrastive learning presents a potential but still\nproblematic solution to this issue. Because most existing methods focus on\nextracting instance-level or pixel-to-pixel representation, which ignores the\ncharacteristics between intra-image similar pixel groups. Moreover, when\nconsidering contrastive pairs generation, most SOTA methods mainly rely on\nmanually setting thresholds, which requires a large number of gradient\nexperiments and lacks efficiency and generalization. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel contrastive learning approach named SuperCL for medical\nimage segmentation pre-training. Specifically, our SuperCL exploits the\nstructural prior and pixel correlation of images by introducing two novel\ncontrastive pairs generation strategies: Intra-image Local Contrastive Pairs\n(ILCP) Generation and Inter-image Global Contrastive Pairs (IGCP) Generation.\nConsidering superpixel cluster aligns well with the concept of contrastive\npairs generation, we utilize the superpixel map to generate pseudo masks for\nboth ILCP and IGCP to guide supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, we also\npropose two modules named Average SuperPixel Feature Map Generation (ASP) and\nConnected Components Label Generation (CCL) to better exploit the prior\nstructural information for IGCP. Finally, experiments on 8 medical image\ndatasets indicate our SuperCL outperforms existing 12 methods. i.e. Our SuperCL\nachieves a superior performance with more precise predictions from\nvisualization figures and 3.15%, 5.44%, 7.89% DSC higher than the previous best\nresults on MMWHS, CHAOS, Spleen with 10% annotations.

Rather, geodesic motion is best understood as a useful\nconstruct -- a formal artefact of the theory's geometric structure, without\nreal or fictitious instantiation, and excluded by the dynamical structure of\nGeneral Relativity.

    "abstract": "This work investigates the long-time asymptotic behavior of a diffusing\npassive scalar advected by fluid flow in a straight channel with a periodically\nvarying cross-section. The goal is to derive an asymptotic expansion for the\nscalar field and estimate the timescale over which this expansion remains\nvalid, thereby generalizing Taylor dispersion theory to periodically modulated\nchannels. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for the advection-diffusion\noperator on a unit cell and employing a biorthogonal eigenfunction expansion,\nwe generalize the classical Fourier integral used in the flat-channel case to\nobtain an integral representation of the scalar field. This representation\nreveals a slow manifold that governs the algebraically decaying dynamics, while\nthe difference between the scalar field and the slow manifold decays\nexponentially in time. Building on this, we derive a long-time asymptotic\nexpansion of the scalar field. We show that the validity timescale of the\nexpansion is determined by the real part of the eigenvalues of a modified\nadvection-diffusion operator, which depends solely on the flow and geometry\nwithin a single unit cell. This framework offers a rigorous and systematic\nmethod for estimating mixing timescales in channels with complex geometries. We\nshow that non-flat channel boundaries tend to increase the timescale, while\ntransverse velocity components tend to decrease it.

    "abstract": "Designing an effective reward function has long been a challenge in\nreinforcement learning, particularly for complex tasks in unstructured\nenvironments. To address this, various learning paradigms have emerged that\nleverage different forms of human input to specify or refine the reward\nfunction. Reinforcement learning from human feedback is a prominent approach\nthat utilizes human comparative feedback, expressed as a preference for one\nbehavior over another, to tackle this problem. In contrast to comparative\nfeedback, we explore multi-level human feedback, which is provided in the form\nof a score at the end of each episode. This type of feedback offers more coarse\nbut informative signals about the underlying reward function than binary\nfeedback. Additionally, it can handle non-Markovian rewards, as it is based on\nthe evaluation of an entire episode. We propose an algorithm to efficiently\nlearn both the reward function and the optimal policy from this form of\nfeedback. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear\nregret and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness through extensive\nsimulations.",

The model supports\ninference in both camera-centric (unstabilized) and world-centric (stabilized)\ncoordinates, with experiments showing that compensating for camera motion leads\nto substantial gains in tracking robustness. By replacing the conventional 2D\nsquare correlation windows used in prior 2D and 3D trackers with a spatially\ngrounded 3D attention mechanism, TAPIP3D achieves strong and consistent results\nacross multiple 3D point tracking benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in\nboth training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale\nresponse evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical\ncomponents in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback\nprotocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work,\nwe show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores\nversus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability\nand induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we\nshow that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation.\nGenerator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features)\nfavored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality\noutputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation,\nproducing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less\ninfluenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator\nmodels can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing\nLLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model\nquality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the\ncases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for\nchoosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation\nobjectives.",

Med-2D SegNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including\nKVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient\n(DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the\ncompact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension\nexpansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while\nkeeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet\nexcels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation,\nwhere it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen\ndatasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even\nthough we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier\nperformance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet\nredefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark\nfor medical image analysis.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-based planners have recently gained significant\nattention. They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning\nalgorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and\nfaster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a\ncommon algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised\ntrajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop\nbenchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly\nunderstands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating\nfrom the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this\nlimitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often\nuse original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories\nare heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to\nthe most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen\nsituations.\n  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop\nsimulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal\nbenchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact\nof the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning\nand reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative\napproaches.

Using numerical simulations, this work aims to\nidentify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH\nmodels of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution\ncode MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of\nyears after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous\nphase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen\nburning. During the initial stage (< 10,000 yr) their luminosities increase by\norders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of\nthe mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in\nthe brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist\nin a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and\nluminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass.

In the first part of this paper, we\nuse combinatorial techniques to establish an improved variety of the\nuncertainty principle in terms of additive energy. In a similar fashion as the\nDonoho-Stark argument, we use this principle to establish an often stronger\nrecovery condition. In the latter half of the paper, we invoke these\ncombinatorial methods to demonstrate two $L^p$ minimizing recovery results.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been observed that when training a deep neural net with SGD,\nthe majority of the loss landscape's curvature quickly concentrates in a tiny\n*top* eigenspace of the loss Hessian, which remains largely stable thereafter.\nIndependently, it has been shown that successful magnitude pruning masks for\ndeep neural nets emerge early in training and remain stable thereafter. In this\nwork, we study these two phenomena jointly and show that they are connected: We\ndevelop a methodology to measure the similarity between arbitrary parameter\nmasks and Hessian eigenspaces via Grassmannian metrics. We identify *overlap*\nas the most useful such metric due to its interpretability and stability. To\ncompute *overlap*, we develop a matrix-free algorithm based on sketched SVDs\nthat allows us to compute over 1000 Hessian eigenpairs for nets with over 10M\nparameters --an unprecedented scale by several orders of magnitude. Our\nexperiments reveal an *overlap* between magnitude parameter masks and top\nHessian eigenspaces consistently higher than chance-level, and that this effect\ngets accentuated for larger network sizes. This result indicates that *top\nHessian eigenvectors tend to be concentrated around larger parameters*, or\nequivalently, that *larger parameters tend to align with directions of larger\nloss curvature*. Our work provides a methodology to approximate and analyze\ndeep learning Hessians at scale, as well as a novel insight on the structure of\ntheir eigenspace.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The evolution of chemical reaction networks is often analyzed through kinetic\nmodels and energy landscapes, but these approaches fail to capture the deeper\nstructural constraints governing complexity growth. In chemical reaction\nnetworks, emergent constraints dictate the organization of reaction pathways,\nlimiting combinatorial expansion and determining stability conditions. This\npaper introduces a novel approach to modeling chemical reaction networks by\nincorporating differential geometry into the classical framework of reaction\nkinetics. By utilizing the Riemannian metric, Christoffel symbols, and a\nsystem-specific entropy-like term, we provide a new method for understanding\nthe evolution of complex reaction systems. The approach captures the\ninterdependence between species, the curvature of the reaction network's\nconfiguration space, and the tendency of the system to evolve toward more\nprobable states. The interaction topology constrains the accessible reaction\ntrajectories and the introduced differential geometrical approach allows\nanalysis of curvature constraints which help us to understand pathway\nsaturation and transition dynamics. Rather than treating reaction space as an\nunconstrained combinatorial landscape, we frame it as a structured manifold\nwith higher order curvature describing a geodesic for system evolution under\nintrinsic constraints. This geometrical perspective offers a unique insight\ninto pathway saturation, self-interruption, and emergent behavior in reaction\nnetworks, and provides a scalable framework for modeling large biochemical or\ncatalytic systems.",

    "abstract": "Spine surgery is a high-risk intervention demanding precise execution, often\nsupported by image-based navigation systems. Recently, supervised learning\napproaches have gained attention for reconstructing 3D spinal anatomy from\nsparse fluoroscopic data, significantly reducing reliance on\nradiation-intensive 3D imaging systems. However, these methods typically\nrequire large amounts of annotated training data and may struggle to generalize\nacross varying patient anatomies or imaging conditions. Instance-learning\napproaches like Gaussian splatting could offer an alternative by avoiding\nextensive annotation requirements. While Gaussian splatting has shown promise\nfor novel view synthesis, its application to sparse, arbitrarily posed real\nintraoperative X-rays has remained largely unexplored. This work addresses this\nlimitation by extending the $R^2$-Gaussian splatting framework to reconstruct\nanatomically consistent 3D volumes under these challenging conditions. We\nintroduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style\ntransfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing\nreconstruction quality. Notably, our framework requires no pretraining, making\nit inherently adaptable to new patients and anatomies. We evaluated our\napproach using an ex-vivo dataset. Expert surgical evaluation confirmed the\nclinical utility of the 3D reconstructions for navigation, especially when\nusing 20 to 30 views, and highlighted the standardization's benefit for\nanatomical clarity. Benchmarking via quantitative 2D metrics (PSNR/SSIM)\nconfirmed performance trade-offs compared to idealized settings, but also\nvalidated the improvement gained from standardization over raw inputs. This\nwork demonstrates the feasibility of instance-based volumetric reconstruction\nfrom arbitrary sparse-view X-rays, advancing intraoperative 3D imaging for\nsurgical navigation.",

We focus on heavy, magnetic DyOH and ErOH\nrelevant to fundamental symmetry tests. We use a restricted-active-space\nself-consistent field method combined with spin-orbit coupling as well as a\nrelativistic coupled-cluster method. In addition, electric dipole and magnetic\nmoments are computed with the self-consistent field method. Analysis of the\nresults from both methods shows that the dominant molecular configuration of\nthe ground state is one where an electron from the partially filled and\nsubmerged 4f orbital of the lanthanide atom moves to the hydroxyl group,\nleaving the closed outer-most 6s$^2$ lone electron pair of the lanthanide atom\nintact in sharp contrast to the bonding in alkaline-earth monohydroxides and\nYbOH, where an electron from the outer-most s shell moves to the hydroxyl\ngroup. For linear molecules the projection of the total electron angular\nmomentum on the symmetry axis is a conserved quantity with quantum number\n$\\Omega$ and we study the polynomial $\\Omega$ dependence of the energies of the\nground states as well as their electric and magnetic moments.

Data heterogeneity\n(non-IID) across clients has imposed significant challenges to FL, which makes\nlocal models re-optimize towards their own local optima and forget the global\nknowledge, resulting in performance degradation and convergence slowdown. Many\nexisting works have attempted to address the non-IID issue by adding an extra\nglobal-model-based regularizing item to the local training but without an\nadaption scheme, which is not efficient enough to achieve high performance with\ndeep learning models. In this paper, we propose a Selective Self-Distillation\nmethod for Federated learning (FedSSD), which imposes adaptive constraints on\nthe local updates by self-distilling the global model's knowledge and\nselectively weighting it by evaluating the credibility at both the class and\nsample level.

However, to\nidentify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for\ncapturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing\nsuch an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not\nobvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using\npersistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional\nindicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational\nproperties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological\nindicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram,\neffectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by\ncomparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude\nof the orientational order parameter $\\langle|\\Psi_6|\\rangle$), typically used\nto identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator\nto experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of\nsimulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the\nproposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems.\nWhile our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems,\nthe approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems\ncomposed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator\noffers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.",

The goal is to compute a fair clustering with at most $k$ clusters\nthat optimizes certain objective function. Considering this problem, they\ndesigned a polynomial-time $O(1)$- and $O(t)$-approximation for the $k$-center\nand the $k$-median objective, respectively. Recently, Carta et al. studied this\nproblem with the sum-of-radii objective and obtained a\n$(6+\\epsilon)$-approximation with running time\n$O((k\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(k/\\epsilon))^kn^{O(1)})$, i.e., fixed-parameter\ntractable in $k$. Here $n$ is the input size. In this work, we design the first\npolynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation for $(t,k)$-fair clustering with the\nsum-of-radii objective, improving the result of Carta et al. Our result places\nsum-of-radii in the same group of objectives as $k$-center, that admit\npolynomial-time $O(1)$-approximations. This result also implies a\npolynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation for the Euclidean version of the problem,\nfor which an $f(k)\\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation was known\ndue to Drexler et al.. Here $f$ is an exponential function of $k$. We are also\nable to extend our result to any arbitrary $\\ell\\ge 2$ number of colors when\n$t=1$. This matches known results for the $k$-center and $k$-median objectives\nin this case. The significant disparity of sum-of-radii compared to $k$-center\nand $k$-median presents several complex challenges, all of which we\nsuccessfully overcome in our work. Our main contribution is a novel\ncluster-merging-based analysis technique for sum-of-radii that helps us achieve\nthe constant-approximation bounds.",

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$\nchain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected\nto a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely\nunentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different\ninitial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an\ninfinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain,\nthe polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized\nspin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these\ninhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page\ncurve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior\nin the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds\nof baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible\ndeep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the\nlatter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and\nthe bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form\nof a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other\nhand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite\ntemperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree\nwith the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively.\nOur findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and\ncould be of relevance to black hole physics.",

The sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy is a\nprincipled method for deriving tractable semidefinite relaxations to generic\npolynomial optimization problems. In this work, we apply ideas from the\nmoment-SOS hierarchy to solve the GW problem.\n  More precisely, we identify extensions of the moment-SOS hierarchy,\npreviously introduced for the discretized GW problem, such that they remain\nvalid for general probability distributions. This process requires a suitable\ngeneralization of positive semidefiniteness over finite-dimensional vector\nspaces to the space of probability distributions. We prove the following\nproperties concerning these continuous extensions: First, these relaxations\nform a genuine hierarchy in that the optimal value converges to the GW\ndistance. Second, each of these relaxations induces a pseudo-metric over the\ncollection of metric measure spaces. Crucially, unlike the GW problem, these\ninduced instances are tractable to compute -- the discrete analogs are\nexpressible as semidefinite programs and hence are tractable to solve.\nSeparately from these properties, we also establish a statistical consistency\nresult arising from sampling the source and target distributions.

Among them, the recently observed Zhang-Rice (ZR)\nexciton in NiPS3 has garnered significant research interest due to its strong\ncorrelation with magnetic ordering and its exceptionally long-lived coherence.\nHerein, we present our in-depth temperature- and polarization-dependent\nphotoluminescence (PL) study of anion-substituted NiPS3-xSex (x=0.008,0.03,0.06\nand 0.09 ) to explore the nature and dynamics of the ZR exciton. Our results\nreveal that, similar to the cation substitution, a small percentage of anion\nsubstitution effectively destroys and modulates the ZR exciton, as evidenced by\nthe emergence of a weaker, lower-energy PL peak in addition to the primary ZR\npeak. The primary and secondary PL peaks exhibit the same anisotropic\npolarization but differ in their peak energy shift and intensity evolution with\nSe substitution, suggesting varying charge transfers of p-orbitals. Notably,\nthe ZR exciton undergoes rapid thermal destabilization at much lower\ntemperatures than two-magnon excitations, highlighting that p-orbital\ninhomogeneity beyond the magnetic ordering structure is a decisive factor in\ndriving its thermal quenching.",

While it is known to be non-continuous with\nrespect to all standard notions of stochastic convergence, it remains robust in\npractical applications. In this work, we review the known counterexamples to\nthe continuity of the MMSE. We observe that, in these counterexamples, the\ndiscontinuity arises from an element in the converging measurement sequence\nproviding more information about the estimand than the limit of the measurement\nsequence. We argue that this behavior is uncharacteristic of real-world\napplications and introduce a new stochastic convergence notion, termed\nMarkovian convergence, to address this issue. We prove that the MMSE is, in\nfact, continuous under this new notion. We supplement this result with\nsemi-continuity and continuity guarantees of the MMSE in other settings and\nprove the continuity of the MMSE under linear estimation.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on a key challenge in visual emotion understanding: given\nan art image, the model pinpoints pixel regions that trigger a specific human\nemotion, and generates linguistic explanations for it. Despite advances in\ngeneral segmentation, pixel-level emotion understanding still faces a dual\nchallenge: first, the subjectivity of emotion limits general segmentation\nmodels like SAM to adapt to emotion-oriented segmentation tasks; and second,\nthe abstract nature of art expression makes it hard for captioning models to\nbalance pixel-level semantics and emotion reasoning. To solve the above\nproblems, this paper proposes the Emotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation\nModel (EmoSEM) model to endow the segmentation framework with emotion\ncomprehension capability. First, to enable the model to perform segmentation\nunder the guidance of emotional intent well, we introduce an emotional prompt\nwith a learnable mask token as the conditional input for segmentation decoding.\nThen, we design an emotion projector to establish the association between\nemotion and visual features. Next, more importantly, to address emotion-visual\nstimuli alignment, we develop a lightweight prefix adapter, a module that fuses\nthe learned emotional mask with the corresponding emotion into a unified\nrepresentation compatible with the language model. Finally, we input the joint\nvisual, mask, and emotional tokens into the language model and output the\nemotional explanations. It ensures that the generated interpretations remain\nsemantically and emotionally coherent with the visual stimuli. Our method\nrealizes end-to-end modeling from low-level pixel features to high-level\nemotion interpretation, delivering the first interpretable fine-grained\nframework for visual emotion analysis. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our model. Code will be made publicly available.",

While\ntraditional power spectrum methods have been widely used for analyzing the 21cm\nforest, these techniques are limited in capturing the non-Gaussian nature of\nthe signal. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST)\nas a novel diagnostic tool for the 21cm forest, which allows for the extraction\nof higher-order statistical features that power spectrum methods cannot easily\ncapture. By decomposing simulated brightness temperature spectra into a\nhierarchy of scattering coefficients, the WST isolates both local intensity\nfluctuations (first-order coefficients) and scale-scale correlations\n(second-order coefficients), revealing the complex, multi-scale non-Gaussian\ninteractions inherent in the 21cm forest. This approach enhances the power of\n21cm forest in distinguishing between different cosmological models, such as\nCold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM), as well as scenarios with\nenhanced X-ray heating. Unlike traditional methods, which focus primarily on\nGaussian statistics, the WST captures richer astrophysical and cosmological\ninformation.

Existing methods for testing behavioral\ndiscrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires\nsignificant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a\nlarge language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects\nbehavioral discrepancies in HLS.

Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with\nadvanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering,\nshowing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines.\nHowever, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to\ntrustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code.\nRecent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky\noutputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain\nunconsciously recognizes its own mistakes. Yet, most of these approaches are\nlimited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving\nindustry-level scalability and practicability. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code\nLLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with\nthe existing infrastructure of software companies. The core idea is that the\nrisk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to\nLLMs. Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on\nlarge-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM\nstates. Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level\nrisk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different\nprogramming languages. Further experiments also reveal that PtTrust provides\nhighly intuitive and interpretable features, fostering greater user trust.

This study\nexamines the spatiotemporal dynamics of guided streamers generated by TPCs\nunder varying gap distances to establish a robust framework for safe and\neffective plasma delivery in endoscopic settings. Combining electrical and\noptical diagnostics, the study characterizes streamer propagation, electric\nfield profiles, and plasma-induced currents in a helium-driven TPC delivering\ncold plasma to a grounded metal target across gaps of 2 to 18 mm. Results show\nthat streamers maintain charge stability and effectively interact with the\ntarget for gap distances below 12 mm, producing significant therapeutic\ncurrents. Beyond this threshold, propagation deteriorates due to recombination\nand reduced electric field intensity. For shorter gaps, counter-propagating\nwaves and secondary streamer interactions are observed, while larger gaps lead\nto charge dissipation and reduced efficacy.

    "abstract": "Self-organized patterns (SOP) in plasma discharges arise from the complex\ninterplay of electric field, reactive species and charged particles, driven by\nnon-linear plasma dynamics. While studies have explored SOP formation in\nvarious configurations, no systematic comparison of positive and negative DC\nglow discharges has been conducted to explain why SOP form exclusively when\npolarization is negative. This study aims to analyze SOP formation mechanisms\nby comparing electrical, optical and spectral properties of positive and\nnegative DC glow discharges interacting with a grounded water surface. Key\ndifferences in gas temperature, electric field and reactive species\ndistribution are hence identified. For positive DC glow discharges (PGD), the\ngas temperature remains in the 350-370 K range, while the reduced electric\nfield remains below 100 Td across the gap. The plasma is dominated by OH and\nN2* species, whose excitation results from direct electron impact and energy\ntransfer in a low-field environment. The absence of strong ionization and\nelectric field gradients leads to a spatially homogeneous emission layer on the\nliquid surface, resulting in a circular uniform plasma (CUP) pattern without\nself-organization. In contrast, SOP emerge exclusively under negative DC glow\ndischarges (NGD) at currents above 15 mA. These discharges present a reduced\nelectric field, peaking at 485 Td at 1mm from the cathode pin, dropping below\n100 Td in the central gap and rising to 460 Td near the water surface. There,\nthe plasma layer still contains OH and N2* species but also N2+ ions, the\nlatter being critical for SOP formation. SOP morphology evolves with gap size:\nat 7 mm, patterns transition from specks to filaments, with pattern diameter\nand thickness as high as 5.5 mm and 210 {\\mu}m respectively. Lowering water\nsurface tension with surfactants reduces SOP size and modifies pattern\nmorphology.",

Traditional approaches often rely on sequence labeling models, which can\nstruggle with long-range dependencies and the inherent complexity of extracting\nmultiple, potentially overlapping entities. Motivated by the advanced language\nunderstanding and generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we\npropose a novel method that reframes financial event entity extraction as a\ntext-to-structured-output generation task. Our approach involves fine-tuning a\npre-trained LLM using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to directly\ngenerate a structured representation, such as a JSON object, containing the\nextracted entities and their precise character spans from the input text. We\nevaluate our method on the challenging CCKS 2019 Financial Event Entity\nExtraction dataset, comparing its performance against strong sequence labeling\nbaselines, including SEBERTNets and sebertNets.

    "abstract": "Soft robots promise inherent safety via their material compliance for\nseamless interactions with humans or delicate environments. Yet, their\ndevelopment is challenging because it requires integrating materials, geometry,\nactuation, and autonomy into complex mechatronic systems. Despite progress, the\nfield struggles to balance task-specific performance with broader factors like\ndurability and manufacturability - a difficulty that we find is compounded by\ntraditional sequential design processes with their lack of feedback loops. In\nthis perspective, we review emerging co-design approaches that simultaneously\noptimize the body and brain, enabling the discovery of unconventional designs\nhighly tailored to the given tasks. We then identify three key shortcomings\nthat limit the broader adoption of such co-design methods within the soft\nrobotics domain. First, many rely on simulation-based evaluations focusing on a\nsingle metric, while real-world designs must satisfy diverse criteria. Second,\ncurrent methods emphasize computational modeling without ensuring feasible\nrealization, risking sim-to-real performance gaps. Third, high computational\ndemands limit the exploration of the complete design space. Finally, we propose\na holistic co-design framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating\na broader range of design values, integrating real-world prototyping to refine\nevaluations, and boosting efficiency through surrogate metrics and model-based\ncontrol strategies.

Detecting lung cancer\nmanually using chest X-Ray image or Computational Tomography (CT) scans image\nposes significant challenges for radiologists.

With the\nrecent emergence of deep learning, particularly through Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), the automated detection of lung cancer has become a much\nsimpler task.

    "abstract": "Cosmic voids are underdense regions within the large-scale structure of the\nUniverse, spanning a wide range of physical scales - from a few megaparsecs\n(Mpc) to the largest observable structures. Their distinctive properties make\nthem valuable cosmological probes and unique laboratories for galaxy formation\nstudies. A key aspect to investigate in this context is the galaxy bias, $b$,\nwithin voids - that is, how galaxies in these underdense regions trace the\nunderlying dark-matter density field. We want to measure the dependence of the\nlarge-scale galaxy bias on the distance to the void center, and to evaluate\nwhether this bias profile varies with the void properties and identification\nprocedure. We apply a void identification scheme based on spherical\noverdensities to galaxy data from the IllustrisTNG magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulation. For the clustering measurement, we use an object-by-object estimate\nof large-scale galaxy bias, which offers significant advantages over the\nstandard method based on ratios of correlation functions or power spectra. We\nfind that the average large-scale bias of galaxies inside voids tends to\nincrease with void-centric distance when normalized by the void radius. For the\nentire galaxy population within voids, the average bias rises with the density\nof the surrounding environment and, consequently, decreases with increasing\nvoid size. Due to this environmental dependence, the average galaxy bias inside\nS-type voids - embedded in large-scale overdense regions - is significantly\nhigher ($\\langle b\\rangle_{\\rm in} > 0$) at all distances compared to R-type\nvoids, which are surrounded by underdense regions ($\\langle b\\rangle_{\\rm in} <\n0$). The bias profile for S-type voids is also slightly steeper. Since both\ntypes of voids host halo populations of similar mass, the measured difference\nin bias can be interpreted as a secondary bias effect.",

    "abstract": "The surge of data traffic in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) places\na significant challenge on limited wireless resources. Semantic communication,\nwhich transmits essential semantics of the raw data, offers a promising\nsolution by reducing redundancy and improving spectrum efficiency. However,\nhigh vehicle mobility, dynamic channel conditions, and dense vehicular networks\nseverely impact transmission reliability in ITS. To address these limitations,\nwe integrate Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) with Joint Source-Channel\nCoding (JSCC) to provide reliable semantic communications for ITS. To\ncounteract the adverse effects of time-varying fading channels and noise, we\npropose a generative signal reconstructor module supported by a local knowledge\nbase, which employs a discriminator for channel error detection and a\nconditional generative network for error correction. We propose three\ninnovative semantic HARQ (sem-HARQ) schemes, Type I sem-HARQ (sem-HARQ-I),\nsem-HARQ with weighted combining (sem-HARQ-WC), and sem-HARQ with synonymous\ncombining (sem-HARQ-SC) to enable reliable JSCC-based semantic communications.\nAt the transmitter, both sem-HARQ-I and sem-HARQ-WC retransmit the same\nsemantic signals, while sem-HARQ-SC introduces redundant semantics across\ndifferent HARQ rounds through synonymous mapping. At the receiver, sem-HARQ-I\nperforms semantic decoding based solely on the currently received signal. In\ncontrast, sem-HARQ-WC enhances reliability by fusing the current received\nsemantic signal with prior erroneous signals at the feature or decision level,\nthereby exploiting semantic information from failed HARQ rounds. Similarly,\nsem-HARQ-SC employs feature-level combining, leveraging incremental semantic\nredundancy to merge semantic features from retransmissions.",

Synthetic values generated by\nimputation models often raise concerns about data quality and the reliability\nof data-driven outcomes. To address these concerns, this article proposes an\nimputation-free incremental attention learning (IFIAL) method for tabular data.\nA pair of attention masks is derived and retrofitted to a transformer to\ndirectly streamline tabular data without imputing or initializing missing\nvalues. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping and\nfixed-size feature sets to enhance the efficiency and performance of the\ntransformer. The average classification performance rank order across 17\ndiverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of IFIAL over 11\nstate-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations.\nFurther experiments substantiate the robustness of IFIAL against varying\nmissing value types and rates compared to methods involving missing value\nimputation. Our analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the\noriginal feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the\nbest choice for the proposed incremental learning.

This discrepancy challenges the standard ${\\Lambda}$CDM model and\nhas become one of the most significant tensions in modern cosmology. The\n${\\Lambda'}$ model offers a potential resolution by introducing modifications\nto the cosmic growth history through alterations to the gravitational sector.\nThe alterations involve including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field\nequations which introduce a time dependent factor yielding a time varying\ncosmological constant\n${\\Lambda'}=(1-{\\alpha(t)^2}{\\Lambda_{DE}}\\frac{{\\rho}_g}{\\rho_{DE}}$ and\nsubsequently the evolution of the cosmos.

High values of ${\\alpha(t)}$ in the late universe\nare the cause of suppressed structure formation and low values of ${\\Lambda'}$.\nThe late universe in the ${\\Lambda'}$ model is effectively or apparently 5-10%\nyounger than in ${\\Lambda}$CDM which translates to\n$H_0={72.734}_{-1.687}^{+1.687}$ km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with late\nuniverse probes. ${\\Lambda'}$ is classified under the dynamical dark energy\nmodels, however unlike alternatives, it does not invoke exotic particles nor\nphantom energy.",

In this work, we address this by\nintroducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with\nmultiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two\ndifferent perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically,\nwe first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into\nmultiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene\nrepresentation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting\ninstances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and\nboundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce\nanother multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level\nperspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also\ntreat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing\nmethods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and\nbackground content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like\nimage editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize\ncontrollable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task. We also\ndemonstrate its superiority in image editing tasks, an area under-explored by\nexisting matting-focused methods, where our approach under zero-shot inference\neven outperforms trained specialized image editing techniques by large margins.\nCode is open-sourced at https://github.com/JiaoSiyi/MPMat.git}.",

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction enables the robots to obtain spatial fine-grained\ngeometry and semantics of the surrounding scene, and has become an essential\ntask for embodied perception. Existing methods based on 3D Gaussians instead of\ndense voxels do not effectively exploit the geometry and opacity properties of\nGaussians, which limits the network's estimation of complex environments and\nalso limits the description of the scene by 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we\npropose a 3D occupancy prediction method which enhances the geometric and\nsemantic scene understanding for robots, dubbed RoboOcc. It utilizes the\nOpacity-guided Self-Encoder (OSE) to alleviate the semantic ambiguity of\noverlapping Gaussians and the Geometry-aware Cross-Encoder (GCE) to accomplish\nthe fine-grained geometric modeling of the surrounding scene. We conduct\nextensive experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet datasets, and our\nRoboOcc achieves state-of the-art performance in both local and global camera\nsettings. Further, in ablation studies of Gaussian parameters, the proposed\nRoboOcc outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of (8.47,\n6.27) in IoU and mIoU metric, respectively. The codes will be released soon.",

Our a1-32B model achieves state-of-the-art performance\namong similar-sized models across all benchmarks, matching larger models like\no1 on competition mathematics while outperforming comparable models by up to\n24.4 percentage points.

Initially, we formalize a\nset-theoretic representation of the universe as the domain wherein intelligence\nexists and characterize intelligence as a structure that involves temporal\nevolution and interaction with other sets. Starting from a naive definition of\nintelligence as \"an entity possessing structures for externally inputting,\ninternally processing, and externally outputting information or matter,\" we\naxiomatically reformulate it within this set-theoretical depiction of the\nuniverse. Applying this axiomatic definition, we compare and interpret three\nexamples -- Hebbian non-optimized neural networks (NNs),\nbackpropagation-optimized NNs, and biological reflexive systems -- in terms of\ntheir intelligence, structural properties, and biological plausibility.\nFurthermore, by extending our definition into a categorical framework, we\nintroduce two categories, \"Time Category\" and \"Intelligence Category,\" along\nwith the functorial relationships between them, demonstrating the potential to\nrepresent changes and mimicry relationships among intelligent systems\nabstractly. Additionally, since intelligence, as defined herein, functions\neffectively only when accompanied by temporal interactions, we introduce the\nconcept of \"activity\" and explore how activity-based conditions influence\nclassifications and interpretations of intelligence. Finally, we suggest that\nour definitional methodology is not limited to intelligence alone, but can be\nsimilarly applied to other concepts, such as consciousness and emotion,\nadvocating for their formal reinterpretation through the same procedural steps:\ndefining a universal representation, selecting naive definitions, and axiomatic\nformalization.",

In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst\nluminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain\nvisible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years.\nWe recover AT 1997bs in $Spitzer$ images from 2004, and a residual source is\nvisible in HST and $JWST$ NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with\na photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 $R_{\\odot}$, without a\nsignificant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at\n4.5 $\\mu$m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by $JWST$ 12.5 years after the\noutburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a\nwarm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K,\nemitting between 3 and 6 $\\mu$m, and a third even colder component responsible\nfor the excess at 8 $\\mu$m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the\n$[3.6]-[4.5]$ colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a\nsimilar evolution: the MIR colour is $\\sim0$ before the optical maximum light,\nit becomes bluer ($\\sim-0.5$ mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to\nredder colours ($\\sim+0.5$ mag) in the following years, before reaching\n$[3.6]-[4.5]\\sim+1.5$ mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate\nthe masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset\nfor different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes\n(0.1 or 1.0 $\\mu$m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of\n(0.1-30)$\\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$ between 3.6 and 13 years after the\noutbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.",

We\nanalytically derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both\ncharge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and\nfrequency. We expand our results in the limits of very small and very large\nmass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). Similar to the massless case, we identify a\ncritical threshold in ($k \\tau$) below which the correlators permit physical\nsolutions. This behavior arises from a logarithmic branch cut in the spectral\nfunction. At higher momenta, solutions emerge significantly below this cut,\ncorresponding to non-hydrodynamic modes. Our analysis demonstrates that\nhydrodynamic poles dominate in the strong coupling regime, while the weak\ncoupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut extending along $\\omega = k$\nand $\\omega = -k$. Notably, in the sound channel, finite mass modifies the\nstandard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely imaginary mode. In\ncontrast, the shear channel exhibits modes that asymptotically converge to\ntheir massless counterparts. Additionally, we compute the transport\ncoefficients for shear and bulk viscosity, along with higher-order gradient\ncorrections up to third order, expressed as perturbative expansions in both the\nsmall and large ($m/T$) regimes.",

    "abstract": "Building a generalizable self-correction system is crucial for robots to\nrecover from failures. Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure,\ntranslating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic\nactions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the\nPhoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect\nhigh-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In\nthis motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process\nmotion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection\ninto coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion\ninstruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a\nmulti-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual\nobservations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these\ntwo models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the\nlow-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and\nfacilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this\nframework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically\nimprove the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments. The\nexperiments conducted in both the RoboMimic simulation and real-world scenarios\nprove the superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a\nvariety of manipulation tasks.

    "abstract": "Auto-bidding, with its strong capability to optimize bidding decisions within\ndynamic and competitive online environments, has become a pivotal strategy for\nadvertising platforms. Existing approaches typically employ rule-based\nstrategies or Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. However, rule-based\nstrategies lack the flexibility to adapt to time-varying market conditions, and\nRL-based methods struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and\nobservations within Markov Decision Process (MDP) frameworks. Furthermore,\nthese approaches often face challenges in ensuring strategy adaptability across\ndiverse advertising objectives. Additionally, as offline training methods are\nincreasingly adopted to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of stable\nonline strategies, the issues of documented behavioral patterns and behavioral\ncollapse resulting from training on fixed offline datasets become increasingly\nsignificant. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel\noffline Generative Auto-bidding framework with Value-Guided Explorations\n(GAVE). GAVE accommodates various advertising objectives through a score-based\nReturn-To-Go (RTG) module. Moreover, GAVE integrates an action exploration\nmechanism with an RTG-based evaluation method to explore novel actions while\nensuring stability-preserving updates. A learnable value function is also\ndesigned to guide the direction of action exploration and mitigate\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problems. Experimental results on two offline\ndatasets and real-world deployments demonstrate that GAVE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests. By\napplying the core methods of this framework, we proudly secured first place in\nthe NeurIPS 2024 competition, 'AIGB Track: Learning Auto-Bidding Agents with\nGenerative Models'.",

This\nstudy investigates the integration of Generative Design, Virtual Reality (VR),\nand Digital Twins (DT) to enhance walkability in urban planning.

Preliminary findings from structured interviews with\nEindhoven residents provide critical insights into pedestrian preferences and\nwalkability considerations. The next phase of the study involves the\ndevelopment of VR-DT integrated prototypes to simulate urban environments,\nassess walkability, and explore the role of Generative Design in generating\nadaptive urban planning solutions.

The collinear states in even\npartial-wave channels are in the same symmetry class of ``altermagnetism\". In\nthis work, we investigate unconventional magnetism in both $p$- and $d$-wave\nchannels within spin-orbit coupled systems with parity and time-reversal\nsymmetries maintained. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the\n$p$-wave channel yields the gyrotropic, Rashba, Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit\ncouplings. They compete and mix evolving from the $\\beta$-phase to the\n$\\alpha$-phase with various types of spin-momentum lockings.

As such, we design an instance of Grover's quantum search\nalgorithm to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters of an NN during\nthe training process, a task traditionally performed using the backpropagation\nalgorithm with the gradient descent method. Indeed, gradient descent has issues\nsuch as exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, or convexity problem.

This\nstudy aims to evaluate the CCT for independent and correlated count data where\nthe individual $p$-values are derived from tests based on Normal approximation\nto the negative binomial distribution. The correlated count data are modelled\nvia copula methods. The CCT performance is evaluated in a simulation study to\nassess the type 1 error rate and the statistical power and compare it with\nexisting methods. In addition, we consider the influence of factors such as the\nsuccess parameter of the negative binomial distribution, the number of\nindividual $p$-values, and the correlation strength. Our results indicate that\nthe negative binomial success parameter and the number of combined individual\n$p$-values may influence the type 1 error rate for the CCT under independence\nor weak dependence. The choice of copula method for modelling the correlation\nbetween count data has a significant influence on type 1 error rates for both\nthe CCT and MinP tests. The CCT has more control over managing the type 1 error\nrate as the strength increases in the Gumbel-Hougaard copula. This knowledge\nmay have significant implications for practical applications.",

Although these methods have made considerable\nadvancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce\nthe overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number\nControl (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the\noverfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on\na generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that\nutilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers,\nthereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on\nvarious sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness\nof VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces\noverfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while\ndecreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands\nand accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Any micropolar fluid containing magnetic particles, such as blood or\nferrofluids, subjected to an external magnetic field experiences a magnetic\ntorque due to the misalignment between particle magnetization and the magnetic\nfield. This effect, known as micromagnetorotation (MMR), remains underexplored\nin blood flows where erythrocyte magnetization is often neglected. To\ninvestigate this, two transient OpenFOAM solvers were developed:\nepotMicropolarFoam, for incompressible, laminar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nmicropolar flows, and epotMMRFoam, which extends it by incorporating MMR. Both\nsolvers use the PISO algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling and adopt the low\nmagnetic Reynolds number approximation. Micropolar effects are modeled by\nincluding the microrotation-vorticity difference in the momentum equation and\nsolving the internal angular momentum equation. In epotMMRFoam, the MMR term is\nadded to this equation, and a constitutive equation for magnetization is also\nsolved. Validation against analytical MHD micropolar Poiseuille flow showed\nexcellent accuracy (error less than 2 percent). Including MMR led to notable\nreductions in velocity (up to 40 percent) and microrotation (up to 99.9\npercent), especially under strong magnetic fields and high hematocrit. Without\nMMR, magnetic effects were minimal due to the low electrical conductivity of\nblood. Simulations of 3D MHD artery and 2D MHD aneurysm flows confirmed these\nfindings. In aneurysm geometries, MMR suppressed vortex cores, indicating\nstrong stabilizing and shear-dampening effects. These solvers show high\npotential for biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia and\ntargeted drug delivery.",

We established a game theory based\nEHMI information disclosure framework for AVs in this study. In considering\nbenevolent deception, this framework divided the decision-making process into\nthree stages, respectively encompassing three key questions: whether to\ndisclose, when to disclose, and what type of intention information to disclose.\nThe results show that theoretical advantages of deception exist in certain\ncases when AV expects to maximize the safety of the interaction. In 40 out of\n484 cases (8.3%), safety can be enhanced through successful deception. Those\nsuccessful deceptions fall into two categories: 1) In 28 of these cases, the\nstraight-going AV expected the left-turning human-driven vehicle (HV) to yield,\nwhile HV exhibited lower speed and higher acceleration; 2) In 12 of these\ncases, AV expected HV to proceed first, while HV exhibited higher speed and\nlower acceleration. We also conducted a VR-based driving simulation experiment,\nand the results confirmed our conclusion.

    "abstract": "Training effective dense retrieval models often relies on hard negative (HN)\nexamples mined from the document corpus via methods like BM25 or cross-encoders\n(CE), processes that can be computationally demanding and require full corpus\naccess. This paper introduces a different approach, an end-to-end pipeline\nwhere a Large Language Model (LLM) first generates a query from a passage, and\nthen generates a hard negative example using \\emph{only} that query text. This\ncorpus-free negative generation contrasts with standard mining techniques. We\nevaluated this \\textsc{LLM Query $\\rightarrow$ LLM HN} approach against\ntraditional \\textsc{LLM Query $\\rightarrow$ BM25 HN} and \\textsc{LLM Query\n$\\rightarrow$ CE HN} pipelines using E5-Base and GTE-Base models on several\nBEIR benchmark datasets. Our results show the proposed all-LLM pipeline\nachieves performance identical to both the BM25 and the computationally\nintensive CE baselines across nDCG@10, Precision@10, and Recall@100 metrics.\nThis demonstrates that our corpus-free negative generation method matches the\neffectiveness of complex, corpus-dependent mining techniques, offering a\npotentially simpler and more efficient pathway for training high-performance\nretrievers without sacrificing results.

The inverse magnetic catalysis\n(IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters\n$G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with\nand without IMC effect.

    "abstract": "Pipeline Parallelism (PP) serves as a crucial technique for training Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), owing to its capability to alleviate memory pressure\nfrom model states with relatively low communication overhead. However, in\nlong-context scenarios, existing pipeline parallelism methods fail to address\nthe substantial activation memory pressure, primarily due to the peak memory\nconsumption resulting from the accumulation of activations across multiple\nmicrobatches. Moreover, these approaches inevitably introduce considerable\npipeline bubbles, further hindering efficiency.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose SlimPipe, a novel approach to\nfine-grained pipeline parallelism that employs uniform sequence slicing coupled\nwith one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) schedule. It reduces the accumulated\nactivations from several microbatches to just one, which is split into several\nslices. Although the slices are evenly partitioned, the computation cost is not\nequal across slices due to causal attention. We develop a sophisticated\nworkload redistribution technique to address this load imbalance. SlimPipe\nachieves (1) near-zero memory overhead and (2) minimal pipeline bubbles\nsimultaneously. The effectiveness of SlimPipe has been proven by thorough\ntesting with diverse model architectures, context window sizes, and\nSlimPipe-specific configurations. For example, on the Llama 70B model, compared\nto state-of-the-art methods, SlimPipe significantly boosts the Model FLOPs\nUtilization (MFU) to up to $1.57\\times$ for a context length of 512K. More\nnotably, for a context length of 2048K, it maintains over 45% utilization on\n256 NVIDIA Hopper 80GB GPUs, while other approaches either suffer significant\nperformance drops or fail entirely due to memory constraints.",

In contrast, the generalized asymmetric Laplace (GAL)\ndistribution enables more flexible modeling of skewness and heavy-tailed\nbehavior, yet it remains vulnerable to extreme observations.

    "abstract": "Multi-agents has exhibited significant intelligence in real-word simulations\nwith Large language models (LLMs) due to the capabilities of social cognition\nand knowledge retrieval. However, existing research on agents equipped with\neffective cognition chains including reasoning, planning, decision-making and\nreflecting remains limited, especially in the dynamically interactive\nscenarios. In addition, unlike human, prompt-based responses face challenges in\npsychological state perception and empirical calibration during uncertain\ngaming process, which can inevitably lead to cognition bias. In light of above,\nwe introduce PolicyEvol-Agent, a comprehensive LLM-empowered framework\ncharacterized by systematically acquiring intentions of others and adaptively\noptimizing irrational strategies for continual enhancement. Specifically,\nPolicyEvol-Agent first obtains reflective expertise patterns and then\nintegrates a range of cognitive operations with Theory of Mind alongside\ninternal and external perspectives. Simulation results, outperforming RL-based\nmodels and agent-based methods, demonstrate the superiority of PolicyEvol-Agent\nfor final gaming victory. Moreover, the policy evolution mechanism reveals the\neffectiveness of dynamic guideline adjustments in both automatic and human\nevaluation.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but\nstruggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.\nTraining separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task\nlearning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from\nsource tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethod, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that\ncaptures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt\nthat preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,\nPT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific\nknowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL\nmethod built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task\nheterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes\nshared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,\navoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training\nlow-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention\nmechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank\ncomponents on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks\ndemonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and\nfew-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.",

In this work, we re-assess the\nRSG problem using late-phase spectroscopy of a sample of 50 SNe II. The [O I]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$6300,6363 emission in the spectra is employed to infer the\nzero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass distribution of the progenitors, which is\nthen transformed into a luminosity distribution via an observation-calibrated\nmass-luminosity relation.

    "abstract": "Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need\nto utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex\nregulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial\nsectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document\nworkflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent\nheterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of\nregulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy\nin critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a\nsolution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory\ncompliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces\nthree innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that\nunifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2)\na multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion\n(HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized\nre-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to\nprioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions\nderived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question\nanswering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been\nsuccessfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings,\nwhere it has already served more than 1,200 people.",

Existing prompt-based\ndebiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt\nchanges, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational\noverhead and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a\nnovel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt\ndesign or model retraining. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis,\nour preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can\nbe encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space. FairSteer\noperates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector\n(DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering. Specifically, it first\ntrains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in\nactivations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from\nsmall contrastive prompt pairs. Subsequently, it performs debiasing by\nadjusting activations with DSVs in the inference stage. Comprehensive\nevaluation with six LLMs demonstrates the superiority of FairSteer across\nquestion-answering, counterfactual input evaluation and open-ended text\ngeneration tasks.

To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-bias Representation\nSide-tuning (LSR-ST), a lightweight PEFT framework that enhances model\nrobustness by introducing shape-biased inductive priors. LSR-ST captures\nshape-aware features using a simple HDConv Block, which integrates large-kernel\nattention and residual learning.

We formalize this concept via\nInformation Bottleneck theory and advocate for it as a key PEFT objective.\nUnlike traditional NLP paradigms that focus on optimizing parameters and\nmemory, visual tasks require models that extract task-defined semantics, rather\nthan just relying on pre-encoded features. This shift enables our approach to\nmove beyond conventional trade-offs, offering more robust and generalizable\nsolutions for vision tasks.

    "abstract": "Navigating unknown environments to find a target object is a significant\nchallenge. While semantic information is crucial for navigation, relying solely\non it for decision-making may not always be efficient, especially in\nenvironments with weak semantic cues. Additionally, many methods are\nsusceptible to misdetections, especially in environments with visually similar\nobjects. To address these limitations, we propose ApexNav, a zero-shot object\nnavigation framework that is both more efficient and reliable. For efficiency,\nApexNav adaptively utilizes semantic information by analyzing its distribution\nin the environment, guiding exploration through semantic reasoning when cues\nare strong, and switching to geometry-based exploration when they are weak. For\nreliability, we propose a target-centric semantic fusion method that preserves\nlong-term memory of the target and similar objects, enabling robust object\nidentification even under noisy detections. We evaluate ApexNav on the HM3Dv1,\nHM3Dv2, and MP3D datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth SR and SPL metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the\neffectiveness of each module. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the\npracticality of ApexNav in physical environments.

While diffusion transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated\nremarkable capabilities in high-quality video generation, scaling them to 2K\nresolution remains computationally prohibitive due to quadratic growth in\nmemory and processing costs. In this work, we propose Turbo2K, an efficient and\npractical framework for generating detail-rich 2K videos while significantly\nimproving training and inference efficiency. First, Turbo2K operates in a\nhighly compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity and memory\nfootprint, making high-resolution video synthesis feasible. However, the high\ncompression ratio of the VAE and limited model size impose constraints on\ngenerative quality. To mitigate this, we introduce a knowledge distillation\nstrategy that enables a smaller student model to inherit the generative\ncapacity of a larger, more powerful teacher model. Our analysis reveals that,\ndespite differences in latent spaces and architectures, DiTs exhibit structural\nsimilarities in their internal representations, facilitating effective\nknowledge transfer. Second, we design a hierarchical two-stage synthesis\nframework that first generates multi-level feature at lower resolutions before\nguiding high-resolution video generation. This approach ensures structural\ncoherence and fine-grained detail refinement while eliminating redundant\nencoding-decoding overhead, further enhancing computational efficiency.Turbo2K\nachieves state-of-the-art efficiency, generating 5-second, 24fps, 2K videos\nwith significantly reduced computational cost.

    "abstract": "The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is essential in MIMO-OFDM\ncommunication systems. Data-aided enhanced receivers, by incorporating domain\nknowledge, effectively mitigate performance degradation caused by imperfect\nCSI, particularly in dynamic wireless environments. However, existing\nmethodologies face notable challenges: they either refine channel estimates\nwithin MIMO subsystems separately, which proves ineffective due to deviations\nfrom assumptions regarding the time-varying nature of channels, or fully\nexploit the time-frequency characteristics but incur significantly high\ncomputational overhead due to dimensional concatenation. To address these\nissues, this study introduces a novel data-aided method aimed at reducing\ncomplexity, particularly suited for fast-fading scenarios in fifth-generation\n(5G) and beyond networks. We derive a general form of a data-aided linear\nminimum mean-square error (LMMSE)-based algorithm, optimized for iterative\njoint channel estimation and signal detection. Additionally, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient alternative to this algorithm, which achieves\ncomparable performance with significantly reduced complexity. Empirical\nevaluations reveal that our proposed algorithms outperform several\nstate-of-the-art approaches across various MIMO-OFDM configurations, pilot\nsequence lengths, and in the presence of time variability. Comparative analysis\nwith basis expansion model-based iterative receivers highlights the superiority\nof our algorithms in achieving an effective trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational complexity.",

In this work, we observe that even\nthe most prominent LLMs, such as OpenAI-o1, suffer from high rates of reasoning\nerrors and hallucinations on tasks requiring commonsense reasoning over\nobscure, long-tail entities. To investigate this limitation, we present a new\ndataset for Commonsense reasoning over Long-Tail entities (CoLoTa), that\nconsists of 3,300 queries from question answering and claim verification tasks\nand covers a diverse range of commonsense reasoning skills. We remark that\nCoLoTa can also serve as a Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) dataset\nsince the support of knowledge required to answer its queries is present in the\nWikidata knowledge graph. However, as opposed to existing KGQA benchmarks that\nmerely focus on factoid questions, our CoLoTa queries also require commonsense\nreasoning. Our experiments with strong LLM-based KGQA methodologies indicate\ntheir severe inability to answer queries involving commonsense reasoning.\nHence, we propose CoLoTa as a novel benchmark for assessing both (i) LLM\ncommonsense reasoning capabilities and their robustness to hallucinations on\nlong-tail entities and (ii) the commonsense reasoning capabilities of KGQA\nmethods.",

However, after the advent of quantum entanglement\nleading to environmental decoherence studies, a substantial leap forward has\nbeen achieved by Zurek and his associates. Their investigation has led to the\nexistence of sturdy pointer states that survive decoherence leading to\nclassicality although still remaining entangled with the environment and the\napparatus states. But in order to avoid the inexplicable collapse postulate,\nZurek invokes Everett's many world conjecture, which is not accepted by many\nexperts. In this article, we present the observation of entanglement sudden\ndeath (ESD), demonstrating that disentanglement of the pointer states is caused\nby the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. We reveal that the\ndecoherence between the pointer states and the environment is consistent with\nunitary evolution when the vacuum modes are included in the calculation, in\nanalogy to the unitary evolution of the whole system in the spontaneous\nemission process. However, the ultimate state of the system is still subject to\nthe totally unpredictable nature of individual quantum fluctuations, causing\nthe stochastic appearance of an arbitrary classical state in von Neumann's\ncollapse axiom even when the entire system evolves unitarily. Therefore, we\nsuggest that an acceptable solution of the long standing measurement problem\nhas finally been achieved.",

Under weather, the relevant topics are\n(1) the correction to pointing arising from refraction in the atmosphere (2)\nthe different delays in the arrival times of signals at different antennas due\nto propagation in the atmosphere (3) monitoring weather parameters to provide\noperations support, e.g. in determining prevalence of precision or normal\nconditions, dynamic scheduling and the choice of antennas to constitute a\nsub-array with a given set of characteristics, among others, and (4) archival.\nHere we restrict ourselves to the first two topics which impact the data\nobtained and its calibration.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual medical image generation effectively addresses data scarcity\nand enhances the interpretability of medical images. However, due to the\ncomplex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced\nclass distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical\nimages from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully\nleverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure\ninformation and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding\ndistortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical\nrelevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we\npropose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent\npathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and\nutilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the\ngeneration of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation\nthrough causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features.\nHere, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological\nand identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by\npathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation\nof diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging\na large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical\nreports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model\non long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.",

Additionally, this systematic review identifies\ncritical research gaps and future research directions, emphasizing the\nnecessity for more diverse datasets, enhanced reproducibility, and improved\nintegration with emerging IoT technologies. This review aims to foster the\ndevelopment of dynamic and adaptive IDS solutions essential for protecting IoT\nnetworks against sophisticated cyber threats.",

    "abstract": "The Deuteronomy transactional key-value store is unique architecturally in\nproviding separation between transaction functionality -- its Transactional\nComponent (TC) and data management -- its Data Component (DC). It is unique in\ntechnology by (1) supporting record caching, a smaller unit than the\ntraditional page; and (2) protecting resources during concurrent execution\nusing a latch-free approach. Both technologies are enabled by delta updating.\nThis paper explains how record caching improves cache cost/performance. It also\nshows how a new latch-free approach makes implementation easier and improves\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\\phi$\nand a heavy scalar $\\sigma$ is studied in the eikonal limit, for gravity\nscenarios containing higher order derivatives, studied in [1]-[6]. It is\nsuggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order\naction is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of\n$M_{GUT}\\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas\nappears enhanced. However, for these new models, the conditions for the eikonal\napproximation to hold has to be revised, as the introduction of new scales may\nchange the allowed center of mass and impulse transfer scales. This issue is\nanalyzed in the text. The statements of the present work however should be\ntaken with care, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is\nnot yet established. The results presented here, in our opinion, are in\nagreement with the suppression of corrections pointed out \\cite{brandhuber},\n\\cite{fradkin} and \\cite{deser} in for the Stelle gravity. The next to leading\norder approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different\nto the GR case, this order generically is non vanishing. An explicit\nregularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The\nneed of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small\nenergy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.",

Rubin\nObservatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to discover\nup to two orders of magnitude more strongly lensed supernovae per year than\nhave so far been observed. Of these, Type IIn supernovae have been predicted to\nbe detected more frequently than any other supernova type, despite their small\nrelative detection fraction amongst non-lensed supernovae. However, previous\nstudies that predict a large population of lensed Type IIn supernova detections\nmodel their time evolving spectrum as a pure blackbody. In reality, there is a\ndeficit in the UV flux of supernovae relative to the blackbody continuum due to\nline-blanketing from iron-group elements in the ejecta and scattering effects.\nIn this work we quantify the effect of this UV suppression on the detection\nrates by LSST of a simulated population of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae,\nrelative to a pure blackbody model, using a mock LSST observing run. With a\nblackbody model, we predict to detect $\\sim$70 lensed Type IIn supernova per\nyear with LSST. By modelling a similar UV deficit to that seen in superluminous\nsupernovae, we recover 60 - 80% of the detections obtained using a pure\nblackbody model, of which $\\sim$10 detections per year are sufficiently bright\n($m_\\textrm{i} < 22.5$ mag) and detected early enough (> 5 observations before\nlightcurve peak) to enable high-cadence spectroscopic follow up.",

We propose an optimization\nframework that leverages RIS technology to enhance user admission based on\nspatial characteristics, priority levels, and resource constraints. Our\napproach first filters users based on angular alignment with RIS reflection\ndirections, then constructs priority queues considering service requirements\nand arrival times, and finally performs user grouping to maximize RIS resource\nutilization. The proposed algorithm incorporates a utility function that\nbalances Quality of Service (QoS) performance, RIS utilization, and MEC\nefficiency in admission decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly improves system performance with RIS-enhanced\nconfigurations. For high-priority eURLLC services, our method maintains over\n90% admission rates even at maximum load, ensuring mission-critical\napplications receive guaranteed service quality.",

Early prediction of\nBW enables timely interventions; however, current methods like ultrasonography\nhave limitations, including reduced accuracy before 20 weeks and operator\ndependent variability. Existing models often neglect nutritional and genetic\ninfluences, focusing mainly on physiological and lifestyle factors. This study\npresents an attention-based transformer model with a multi-encoder architecture\nfor early (less than 12 weeks of gestation) BW prediction. Our model\neffectively integrates diverse maternal data such as physiological, lifestyle,\nnutritional, and genetic, addressing limitations seen in prior attention-based\nmodels such as TabNet. The model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 122\ngrams and an R-squared value of 0.94, demonstrating high predictive accuracy\nand interoperability with our in-house private dataset. Independent validation\nconfirms generalizability (MAE: 105 grams, R-squared: 0.95) with the IEEE\nchildren dataset. To enhance clinical utility, predicted BW is classified into\nlow and normal categories, achieving a sensitivity of 97.55% and a specificity\nof 94.48%, facilitating early risk stratification. Model interpretability is\nreinforced through feature importance and SHAP analyses, highlighting\nsignificant influences of maternal age, tobacco exposure, and vitamin B12\nstatus, with genetic factors playing a secondary role.
